v.

**Michael Smith,**
Defendant

---

**COMPLAINT**

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel (if any), and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Smith, alleges as follows:

**I. Parties**

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

2. Defendant Michael Smith is the landlord of the aforementioned property located at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

**II. Factual Allegations**

3. On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

4. Since approximately three months ago, Plaintiff has discovered mouse droppings in her kitchen within the leased premises.

5. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the pest issue, following which Defendant placed a few traps that yielded minimal success in eliminating the infestation.

6. Despite Plaintiff's diligent maintenance of cleanliness in the kitchen, the mouse infestation persists, leading to ongoing anxiety and health concerns for Plaintiff.

7. Defendant's response to the pest issue has been inadequate, with only one visit from an exterminator who recommended more comprehensive treatment, which Defendant has refused on grounds of excessive cost.

8. Plaintiff has incurred financial losses amounting to approximately $280 due to discarded food items contaminated by the infestation and expenses related to purchasing sealing containers.

**III. Cause of Action**

9. The Defendant's failure to sufficiently address and remediate the persistent mouse infestation within the leased premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential lease agreement in Massachusetts.

**IV. Prayer for Relief**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief from the Court:

a. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff for damages in the amount of $280;

b. Any additional relief the Court deems just and proper;

c. Costs and reasonable attorney's fees; and

d. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

**V. Jury Demand**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
