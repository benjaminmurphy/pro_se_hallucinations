The case is about procedural time limits in arbitration-confirmation proceedings, not about a defendant\u2019s duty to maintain property safely, so it does not support the stated proposition.",

It does not involve a negligence claim, duty of care, or any discussion of direct or proximate causation of damage to a plaintiff\u2019s car or any other property damage. Therefore it provides no authority for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of damage to a plaintiff\u2019s car.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In the present case, the mandatory recycling fee represents a specific payment for curbside recycling services and is associated with the necessary costs of the services rendered. In addition, the fee is uniformly imposed upon all residential property owners to which the ordinance applies. Accordingly, even though the fee is compulsory, we hold that the mandatory recycling fee is a fee and not a tax."

It does not address any duty to secure a ladder, vehicle safety risks, premises liability, or any analogous negligence duty. Therefore, it cannot be cited as authority that a defendant breached a duty by failing to secure a ladder or protect a plaintiff\u2019s vehicle from that hazard.",

And, as a result, Bank One held open Ping\u2019s line of credit, and Bank One continued to advance Ping funds from that account. \u2026 Given the plain meaning of the Credit Agreement and the mortgage that secured it, it was incumbent on Bank of America to secure release of the Bank One Mortgage as a condition of its new loan to Ping.\u201d"
