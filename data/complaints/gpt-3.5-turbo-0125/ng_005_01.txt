2. Defendant, Mark Reynolds, is a resident of Springfield, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum, and the parties are residents of the jurisdiction.

4. Venue is proper in Hampden Superior Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, the property owned by Defendant.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On March 15, 2023, at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, Defendant negligently maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against a wooden fence in the shared driveway with Plaintiff.

6. Prior to the incident, Plaintiff had expressed concerns to Defendant about the safety hazard posed by the unstable placement of the ladder next to where Plaintiff parked her car, and Defendant had failed to take corrective action.

7. On a windy day, the unstable ladder fell over due to a gust of wind, crashing onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff's car, causing significant damage including dents to the hood and cracks to the windshield.

12. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the damage sustained by Plaintiff's car.

13. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered damages, including property damage, medical expenses, and lost wages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $$0 for property damage, medical expenses, and lost wages;

2. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

3. Costs and reasonable attorneys' fees; and
