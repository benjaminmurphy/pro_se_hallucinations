Sarah Johnson  
Plaintiff  

v.  

Michael Smith  
Defendant  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, and, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, M.G.L. c. 209, § 36, and relevant case law, respectfully states as follows:

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, and the Defendant, Michael Smith, are the parents of Ethan Johnson, a ten-year-old child.

2. On October 15, 2021, this Honorable Court entered an order granting the parties shared legal custody of Ethan, with Ethan primarily residing with Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, and visiting Defendant, Michael Smith, on weekends.

3. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, Ethan Johnson.

4. Plaintiff has become aware of concerning and potentially unsafe conditions at Defendant's residence. Ethan has reported to Plaintiff that there are "special drinks" at Defendant's house and that Defendant "can't walk straight" at times. Additionally, a neighbor has provided Plaintiff with a video showing Defendant stumbling while attempting to get Ethan out of the car late at night. Furthermore, Ethan appears exhausted every Monday morning according to the school.

5. These new facts raise serious concerns about Ethan's safety and well-being when in the care of Defendant. Plaintiff believes that the current custody arrangement, particularly the unsupervised overnights with Defendant, may not be in the best interest of Ethan.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to require supervised visitation or impose any other appropriate conditions that the Court deems necessary to ensure Ethan's safety and well-being during visits with Defendant.

2. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

[Signature]  
Sarah Johnson, Plaintiff  

DATED: December 1, 2025
