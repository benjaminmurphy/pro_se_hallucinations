COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES Emily Johnson, the Petitioner, pro se, and for her Complaint for Modification against Michael Smith, the Respondent, states as follows:

1. The Petitioner, Emily Johnson, and the Respondent, Michael Smith, are the parents of Sophie Johnson (age 10) and Jacob Johnson (age 8).

2. The original custody order in question was entered by this Honorable Court on April 15, 2021, establishing joint legal custody with the children primarily residing with the Petitioner and visiting the Respondent on a regular schedule every other weekend.

3. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, a judgment or temporary order concerning custody may be modified if there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original order.

4. The Petitioner asserts that there has been a material change in circumstances warranting a modification of the existing custody order. Specifically, over the past year, the Respondent has engaged in behavior that undermines the children's relationship with the Petitioner, including disparaging the Petitioner to the children and causing emotional distress. The children's well-being and emotional health have been affected, as evidenced by one of the children experiencing physical symptoms on transition days.

5. The actions of the Respondent, including unilaterally scheduling activities during the Petitioner's weekends without consultation and blaming the Petitioner for the children missing said activities, demonstrate a lack of cooperation and communication between the parties, which is essential for effective co-parenting.

6. It is in the best interests of the children that the custody arrangement be modified to promote their emotional well-being and stability. The Petitioner requests primary physical custody of the children with visitation rights for the Respondent to be determined by the court.

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Petitioner;
b. Implement a visitation schedule that is in the best interests of the children;
c. Order appropriate counseling for the children to address any emotional distress caused by the Respondent's actions; and
d. Grant any further relief that the court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
