It does not involve landlord-tenant law, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, or any standard for when building security issues (like broken locks or unauthorized access) constitute a substantial interference with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment. Accordingly, it provides no support for the stated Massachusetts quiet enjoyment proposition and appears to be an entirely unrelated citation.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Markoff next claims that there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for burglary, because the State did not prove that he intended to commit theft when he broke into the Dairy Queen. Intent to commit a felony is an element of burglary that has received considerable attention from the Supreme Court recently.\n\n\u2026 The evidence that Markoff\u2019s hand was on or above the Dairy Queen cash register pointed to an intent to commit the specific felony of theft. The evidence was sufficient to sustain Markoff\u2019s conviction for burglary."
