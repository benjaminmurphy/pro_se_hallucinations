IN THE BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT
ROXBURY DIVISION

Jordan Williams
Plaintiff

v.

Laura Smith
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff Jordan Williams, by and through undersigned counsel, and hereby files this Complaint against the Defendant Laura Smith, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Williams, is an individual residing at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA.

2. Defendant, Laura Smith, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the claims alleged herein arise under Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, as the subject property is located in Roxbury, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the basement unit located at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA, commencing on March 1, 2022.

6. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to unforeseen medical bills but subsequently paid the rent in full, including the applicable late fee.

7. In November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water seeping in through the basement wall of the leased premises whenever it rained heavily. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the issue, who promised to investigate but failed to take any action in a timely manner.

8. Subsequently, a city inspection revealed not only the water seepage issue but also various other code violations on the property.

9. As a result of the water damage, Plaintiff's rug and bookshelf suffered approximately $400 worth of damages.

10. Plaintiff has been forced to run a dehumidifier constantly to address the water seepage issue, leading to increased electricity expenses.

11. Defendant, in response to these events, has labeled Plaintiff as a "problem tenant" and threatened not to renew the lease when it expires in March, attributing the decision to the late rent payment rather than the property violations. The timing of this decision appears suspicious under the circumstances.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. The failure to timely address the water seepage issue and the subsequent threats of lease non-renewal constitute a breach of Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Award damages in the amount of $400 for the property damage incurred;
b. Order Defendant to promptly address and rectify the water seepage issue and any other code violations on the property;
c. Enjoin Defendant from taking retaliatory actions against Plaintiff in relation to the lease renewal;
d. Award any further relief that the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

Respectfully submitted,
