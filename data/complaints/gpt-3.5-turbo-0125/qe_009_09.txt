Jessica Collins
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Thompson
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Collins, by and through undersigned counsel (if applicable), and files this Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson, stating as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Collins ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is the landlord of the aforementioned residential property located at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as it pertains to a landlord-tenant dispute within the geographic jurisdiction of Springfield, Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Housing Court of Springfield, Massachusetts, as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for a two-bedroom apartment at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

6. Since approximately October 20, 2025, one of the bedrooms in the apartment rented by Plaintiff has been without electricity due to faulty wiring, rendering the outlets and overhead light inoperable.

7. Despite Defendant being notified of the electrical issues, Defendant has failed to remedy the situation in a timely manner, citing complexities with the building's old wiring.

8. As a result of the prolonged lack of electricity in the bedroom, Plaintiff has been unable to utilize the room as a home office, incurring additional expenses at local coffee shops to work remotely, totaling approximately $15 per day.

9. Plaintiff has also been forced to secure a coworking space membership at a cost of $150 per month due to the inability to use the affected room for work purposes.

10. The compromised functionality of the bedroom has led to the overcrowding of Plaintiff's living room with office equipment, significantly impacting the livability of the apartment.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. Plaintiff alleges a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as implied in every residential lease agreement under Massachusetts law, specifically due to Defendant's failure to provide habitable living conditions by remedying the electrical issues in a timely manner.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Collins requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Thompson for:

a. Damages in the amount of $900 for additional expenses incurred and diminished living conditions;

b. Prejudgment interest as allowed by law;

c. Attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 186, section 15B; and

d. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.
