It does not address Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, implied covenants of quiet enjoyment, or electrical service in a rental unit. The citation to 363 N.E.2d 1232 here is merely a reporter reference and not related to the stated proposition, so this opinion does not support the claimed legal principle.",

It was well within the authority of Judge Richards, acting pursuant to Ind. Code \u00a7 33-5-29.5-19, as Chief Judge of that court to take temporary assignment of one of Judge Letsinger\u2019s cases during his illness, and after Judge Letsinger\u2019s return to work to reassign the case to Judge Letsinger.\""

Flint concerns evidentiary rules about refreshing a witness\u2019s recollection and the proper allocation of the burden of proof in a dispute over impounded animals. It does not address landlord-tenant law, implied covenants, quiet enjoyment, or the provision or maintenance of utilities such as electricity. Therefore, it cannot be authority for the proposition that failure to provide bedroom electricity breaches the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.",
