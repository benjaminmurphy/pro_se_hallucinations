IN THE CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT

Emily Johnson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Richards
Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 45 River Street, Cambridge, MA.

2. Defendant Michael Richards ("Defendant") is the landlord of the residential premises located at 45 River Street, Cambridge, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, § 21.

4. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court as the subject property and the events giving rise to this action are located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 15, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 45 River Street, Cambridge, MA.

6. Since approximately two months ago, Defendant has initiated significant renovations on the adjacent unit to Plaintiff's apartment, causing persistent and disruptive construction noise during weekdays from 8 AM to 5 PM.

7. The construction noise includes drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers, significantly interfering with Plaintiff's ability to work from home and concentrate on calls.

8. Despite Defendant providing advance notice of the renovation project, the prolonged and ongoing disruption has severely impacted Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the premises.

9. Furthermore, dust from the construction work has infiltrated Plaintiff's unit through the vents, posing health and safety concerns.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant's conduct constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff as a tenant under Massachusetts law.

11. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, § 14 provides that landlords must not interfere with a tenant's quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

12. Numerous Massachusetts courts have recognized the covenant of quiet enjoyment as vital to the landlord-tenant relationship, including cases such as Phipps v. Zarella, 208 N.E.2d 364 (Mass. 1965) and Mealand v. Engineering Associates, 747 N.E.2d 237 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff for compensatory damages in the amount of $3,000;

B. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper;

C. Award Plaintiff the costs and expenses of this action; and

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable.

Respectfully submitted on this 1st day of December, 2025.

Emily Johnson, Plaintiff
