Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff

v.

Kyle Miller, Defendant
Docket Number: [TO BE ASSIGNED BY THE COURT]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

NOW COMES Jessica Thompson, the Plaintiff in the above-styled action, and for her Complaint for Modification of Custody against Kyle Miller, the Defendant, states as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and the Defendant, Kyle Miller, are the parents of two children: Emma Thompson, born on [Date of Birth] and Noah Thompson, born on [Date of Birth].
2. The parties are subject to a prior court order entered on May 15, 2022, establishing joint legal custody with the primary residence of the children with the Plaintiff and scheduled visitation by the Defendant every other weekend.
3. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order based on a significant change in circumstances necessitating the best interests of the children to reside primarily with her, as detailed herein.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Despite the existing court order emphasizing mutual respect and support for the parental relationship, the Defendant has engaged in a pattern of behavior that undermines the children's well-being and the co-parenting relationship.
5. The Defendant unilaterally signs the children up for conflicting activities during the Plaintiff’s scheduled weekends without consultation, causing stress and emotional distress for the children when they cannot attend.
6. The Defendant has disparaged the Plaintiff in front of the children by labeling her as "selfish" and suggesting that she does not love the children when requesting a revision to the visitation schedule.
7. As a result of the Defendant’s actions, one of the children has developed physical symptoms, such as stomach aches, on transition days, indicative of the distress and tension caused by the current custody arrangement.
8. The Plaintiff believes that a modification of custody is necessary to ensure the children’s emotional well-being and stability by residing primarily with her, thereby minimizing the negative impact of the Defendant’s detrimental conduct and ensuring a nurturing environment for the children's growth.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of Emma Thompson and Noah Thompson to the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, with visitation rights to the Defendant, Kyle Miller, as deemed appropriate by the Court.
2. Establish clear guidelines regarding scheduling decisions and activities, requiring mutual consultation and agreement between the parties to ensure the children’s best interests are prioritized.
3. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:

1. Modify the existing custody order in the best interests of the children, Emma Thompson and Noah Thompson.
2. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
