IN THE DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE COUNTY OF BROCKTON
STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

Jason Callahan
Plaintiff

v.

Brockton Community Center
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff, Jason Callahan, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant, Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jason Callahan, is a resident of Brockton, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a corporate entity authorized to do business in Massachusetts, with its principal place of business located at 123 Main St, Brockton, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On or about September 15, 2023, at the premises of Brockton Community Center located at 123 Main St, Brockton, MA, Plaintiff's minor child was enrolled in an after-school program supervised by the Defendant.

4. Despite representations by the Defendant that all children would be supervised at all times, on the aforementioned date, one of the staff members responsible for the supervision left the gym area to perform administrative tasks, leaving only one staff member present.

5. The remaining staff member failed to adequately supervise the children, particularly two older boys who engaged in a rough and unsafe tackle game on the hardwood floor of the gym.

6. Despite being made aware of the dangerous play by other children, the staff member negligently disregarded the warnings, stating "boys will be boys."

7. Consequently, due to the staff's negligence and failure to intervene in the hazardous situation, Plaintiff's eight-year-old child, who was smaller in stature, was violently tackled by one of the older boys, resulting in a severe concussion after hitting his head on the floor. The minor child lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.

8. As a direct result of the incident, Plaintiff's minor child incurred medical expenses amounting to approximately $3,500 and suffered damages including missed school days and emotional distress.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

10. Defendant owed a duty of care to supervise the children in its after-school program, including Plaintiff's minor child, to ensure their safety and prevent foreseeable harm.

11. Defendant breached its duty of care by negligently failing to adequately supervise the children, failing to intervene in dangerous activities, and failing to prevent the foreseeable harm that resulted in the injury to Plaintiff's minor child.

12. The breach of the duty of care by Defendant was the proximate cause of the injuries suffered by Plaintiff's minor child.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff's minor child suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, and incurred medical expenses and other damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendant as follows:

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $3,500 for medical expenses, and additional damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other losses to be proven at trial;

B. Costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting this action;

C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
