Plaintiff

v.

Emily Rodriguez,
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Taylor ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, and alleges the following Complaint against Defendant Emily Rodriguez ("Defendant"):

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Taylor is a resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts.
2. Defendant Emily Rodriguez is the owner of the property located at 123 Maple St, Worcester, MA 01603.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter because the incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred within Worcester County, Massachusetts.
4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court as the location of the incident and the Defendant's residence are both within Worcester County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On February 10, 2023, at the premises located at 123 Maple St, Worcester, MA 01603, Defendant failed to adequately clear or treat the sidewalk outside the property following a snowstorm.
6. Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but neglected to put down any salt or sand to prevent the path from becoming a hazardous ice sheet.
7. Over the subsequent days, the path cleared by Defendant turned into a sheet of ice due to melting during the day and refreezing at night.
8. Despite being informed by tenants residing in the property and sent pictures of the hazardous condition, Defendant recklessly ignored their warnings and refused to take corrective action, stating that "the sun will take care of it."
9. On February 10, 2023, Plaintiff Jessica Taylor was delivering groceries to a tenant when she slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk, resulting in a lower back injury.
10. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence in failing to properly maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition, Plaintiff suffered injuries, incurring approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and losing approximately $800 in wages due to missed work.

CAUSES OF ACTION

11. Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 84, Section 15.
12. Defendant breached this duty by failing to adequately clear or treat the sidewalk following the snowstorm, creating a hazardous condition that led to Plaintiff's injuries.
13. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.
14. Defendant's actions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Taylor respectfully requests the following relief from this Honorable Court:
