IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF NEWTON COUNTY

EMILY JOHNSON,
Plaintiff

v.

MARK THOMPSON,
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is a resident of Newton, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is a resident of Newton, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises from an incident that occurred on April 15, 2023, at the Whiting Park located in Newton, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court.

4. The amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On the aforementioned date, Plaintiff was jogging on a designated path within Whiting Park, where signs clearly indicate that all dogs must be leashed while in the park.

6. Defendant, Mark Thompson, was at the park with his large dog, known to be frequently allowed to roam off-leash by Defendant.

7. Defendant negligently allowed his dog to run loose and unsupervised while he was engaged in conversations with friends, holding the leash over his shoulder but not attached to the dog.

8. The dog, unleashed and uncontrolled by Defendant, suddenly charged at Plaintiff, barking loudly, causing Plaintiff to fear for her safety.

9. In an attempt to evade the approaching unleashed dog, Plaintiff swerved off the path and tripped over a tree root, resulting in her falling down a small embankment and suffering a broken wrist.

10. Despite several other joggers witnessing the incident, the Defendant failed to promptly restrain his dog, only calling it back after Plaintiff had fallen and sustained injuries.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence in allowing his dog to run loose in violation of park rules, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist, incurring approximately $5,200 in medical expenses and losing approximately $2,000 in wages due to missed work and a scheduled piano recital.

CAUSES OF ACTION

12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

13. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to prevent harm while in control of his dog in a public park.

14. Defendant breached this duty by allowing his dog to run loose and unsupervised in a public park where leashes are mandated.

15. The breach of this duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

16. Defendant's conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $7,200;

b. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

c. Award Plaintiff all costs and disbursements incurred in this action, including reasonable attorney fees;

d. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
