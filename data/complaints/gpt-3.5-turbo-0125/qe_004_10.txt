JORDAN MILLER,
Plaintiff

v.

HAROLD FINCH,
Defendant

CASE NO.: [To be filled by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Jordan Miller, by and through undersigned counsel, and for the Complaint against the Defendant, Harold Finch, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jordan Miller, is a resident and tenant of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604.

2. The Defendant, Harold Finch, is the landlord of the aforementioned premises.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in Worcester District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about August 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent the premises at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604.

5. Since approximately three months ago, the Plaintiff has repeatedly notified the Defendant about the presence of mice in the leased premises, primarily in the kitchen.

6. Despite the Plaintiff's complaints, the Defendant's sole response has been to sporadically set traps and engage a single exterminator visit, which the Plaintiff believes to be insufficient to address the ongoing infestation.

7. The Plaintiff has incurred damages as a result of the mice infestation including approximately $280 in discarded food items and container expenses.

8. The Plaintiff's repeated requests for further action to address the infestation have been disregarded by the Defendant, causing ongoing distress and inconvenience.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. The Defendant's failure to adequately address and remedy the mice infestation constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff for damages in the amount of $280;
b. Grant any further relief as the Court may deem just and proper; and
c. Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney fees associated with this action.

JURY DEMAND

The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
