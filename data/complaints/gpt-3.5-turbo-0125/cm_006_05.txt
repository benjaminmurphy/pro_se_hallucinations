COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION     
Docket No. [To be Assigned by the Court]      

COMES NOW, Sarah Thompson ("Plaintiff"), pro se, and files this Complaint for Modification against James Smith ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

I. PARTIES      
1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is a resident of [Your City], Massachusetts.      
2. The Defendant, James Smith, is a resident of [Defendant's City], Massachusetts.      
3. The Parties are the parents of two children, Emily Thompson (10 years old) and Lucas Thompson (8 years old).      

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE      
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 209, § 38, as the subject matter of this action concerns child custody modification.      
5. Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court as the Parties and the children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.      

III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS      
6. On June 15, 2021, a custody order was entered granting primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and granting the Defendant alternate weekend visits and one midweek visit.      
7. Since the entry of the custody order, the Defendant has begun living with a person with a criminal record for assault and battery and a history of domestic violence.      
8. The children have reported that this person exhibits aggressive behavior, including yelling, door slamming, and physical violence towards them.      
9. On one occasion, this person grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a mark on their arm.      
10. A neighbor has called law enforcement during a loud argument in which the children were present.      

IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION      
11. Due to the material change in circumstances, as evidenced by the criminal record and violent behavior of the person with whom the Defendant now resides, the Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to ensure the safety and well-being of the children.      
12. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that either the person with the criminal record is not present during the Defendant's visitation with the children or that the visits be supervised to protect the children from harm.      

V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF      
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:      
a. Modify the existing custody order to prohibit the person with the criminal record from being present during the Defendant's visitation with the children; or, in the alternative,      
b. Order that the Defendant's visitation with the children be supervised for their protection.      
c. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.      

VI. DEMAND FOR TRIAL      
The Plaintiff demands a trial on this matter as provided by the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure.
