It does not discuss premises liability, sidewalks, or any duty of a property owner to maintain sidewalks. Therefore it does not support a proposition about a property owner\u2019s duty to maintain sidewalks.",

We answer that question in the negative.\n\n\u2026 Our recognition of a right of recovery for the loss of a spouse\u2019s consortium \u2026 promotes that value. Conversely, that value would be subverted by our recognition of a right to recover for loss of consortium by a person who has not accepted the correlative responsibilities of marriage."

There is no discussion of tort law, landowner duty, or sidewalk ice, so it does not support a proposition about liability for icy sidewalk injuries. The citation appears to be to an entirely different case than the one whose text is provided.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "As a result of an incident that occurred in February of 1983, Thomas E. Blair, Leslie D. Caldwell, Jr., Richard J. Higgins, and Donald B. Walsh were all convicted on indictments that charged them with aggravated rape. On appeal, they contend that the judge improperly excluded evidence of a prior false allegation of sexual abuse allegedly made by the victim. In addition, they find fault with his instructions to the jury. We affirm the convictions."

Using this case for that proposition would therefore be inaccurate and out of context.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThere is no existing case authority interpreting Uniform Summary Process Rule 10(d)(iii). We conclude that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 suggestion, the Rule cannot be reasonably construed as voiding an otherwise valid default judgment issued after proper service and actual notice to a defendant-tenant\u2026 In short, there is nothing in Rule 10(d)(iii) which entitled the defendants in this case to relief from judgment pursuant to Mass.

It addresses a town\u2019s obligation to submit an unconditional funding request for a staffing provision in a collective bargaining agreement, not liability for failure to maintain safe premises. Therefore it does not support a proposition about premises liability or failure to maintain safe property conditions.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cGiven the plain language of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 (b), and this case history, we conclude that the town was required to submit a budget that unconditionally and fully funded the staffing provision.\u2026 The plain language of par. (m) does not authorize town officials to submit a budget contingent on an override. There is no merit in any of the arguments advanced by the town to the effect that the override statute nevertheless changes the obligation of town officials to submit a proposal for full funding of the staffing provision under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 (b).\u201d"

It does not analyze premises liability, invitee/licensee status, or any duty of care owed by a property owner or occupier to persons entering the premises. Because there is no discussion of a civil duty of care standard for entrants onto land, the case does not support the stated proposition.",

It does not involve premises liability, dangerous or hazardous physical conditions, or a failure to correct such conditions. The holding is about enforceability of the executor\u2019s contract and the effect of a probate license, not liability for failing to remedy hazards, so it does not support the stated proposition.",

The first is owed to and enforceable by the beneficiaries of the estate, while the second is owed to and enforceable by a stranger to the estate.

Witt, 139 Mass. 63 (1885), where the court considered the precise question involved in this case: 'A majority of the court is of opinion, that it is a common method of measurement in the country, where the boundary is a stream or way, to measure from the bank of the stream or the side of the way; and that there is a reasonable presumption that the measurements were made in this way, unless something appears affirmatively in the deed to show that they began at the centre line of the stream or way' (emphasis supplied).\""
