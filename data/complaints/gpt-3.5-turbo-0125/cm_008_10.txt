Lindsay Carter
Plaintiff

v.

Jason Reynolds
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter, hereby files this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Jason Reynolds, and in support thereof states as follows:

1. The Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter, and the Defendant, Jason Reynolds, are the parents of one minor child, Emily Carter, born on [Child's Date of Birth], currently aged 10.

2. On April 15, 2022, this Honorable Court entered a Judgment establishing custody arrangements between the parties, which allocated shared legal custody to both parents, designated Lindsay Carter as the primary residential parent, and granted substantial weekend visitation to Jason Reynolds, including Sunday nights.

3. In the year following the establishment of the current custody order, material changes in circumstances have arisen, necessitating a modification of the custody arrangement. Specifically, the Defendant has exhibited a pattern of behavior that is detrimental to the well-being and educational needs of the minor child.

4. The Plaintiff avers that the Defendant has been repeatedly keeping the minor child home from school on Mondays following their weekend visitations, citing unfounded reasons such as the child needing a "mental health day." These unauthorized absences have led to truancy warnings from the school and a decline in the minor child's academic performance, as evidenced by decreased grades and test scores.

5. Furthermore, the Defendant has failed to comply with the parties' obligation to cooperatively address the minor child's educational needs, as stipulated in the current custody order. The Defendant regularly refuses to facilitate the minor child's attendance at tutoring sessions scheduled during his designated weekend visitations.

6. Given the Defendant's actions and their adverse impact on the minor child's education and well-being, it is in the child's best interests that the custody order be modified to either grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding school attendance or to reduce the Defendant's overnight visitation on school nights.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the current custody order to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding the minor child's school attendance; or
b. Modify the current custody order to reduce the Defendant's overnight visitation on school nights;
c. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
