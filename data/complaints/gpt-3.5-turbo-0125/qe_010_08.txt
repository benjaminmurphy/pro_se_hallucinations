LINDA MATTHEWS,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Linda Matthews, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. Defendant, Linda Matthews, is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in the Middlesex Superior Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 4.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852, commencing on June 1, 2022.

5. Plaintiff discovered the presence of mold in the bathroom of the rented premises. The mold originated in the corner of the shower and has since spread to the ceiling, causing respiratory issues for Plaintiff.

6. Plaintiff immediately informed Defendant of the mold infestation. Despite Plaintiff's notifications, Defendant merely inspected the mold and unjustly blamed Plaintiff for its presence, alleging inadequate ventilation maintenance on Plaintiff's part.

7. Plaintiff disputes Defendant's allegations, as she consistently used the exhaust fan during showers, even though the bathroom lacks a window for additional ventilation. Defendant's refusal to address the inadequate ventilation contributed to the mold proliferation and subsequent health issues for Plaintiff.

8. The mold infestation has caused Plaintiff monetary damages, including the disposal of a shower curtain and towels, totaling approximately $60. Plaintiff further seeks damages for the respiratory issues caused by the mold.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Defendant's conduct constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as set forth in Massachusetts common law and codified in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief from this Honorable Court:

   a. Award damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $200 for property damages and health issues suffered by Plaintiff;
   
   b. Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper; and
   
   c. Award Plaintiff the costs of litigation and reasonable attorney's fees.

Respectfully submitted,
