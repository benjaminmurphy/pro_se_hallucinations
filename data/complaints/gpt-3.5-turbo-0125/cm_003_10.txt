Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff,
v.
Michael Rogers, Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff Jessica Thompson, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, and alleges as follows:

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of [Your City], Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Rogers, is also a resident of [City], Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of a minor child, Ethan Rogers, born on [Child's Date of Birth].

4. On September 15, 2021, this Honorable Court entered an Order granting the parties shared legal custody of Ethan Rogers, with Ethan primarily residing with Jessica Thompson and visiting Michael Rogers on weekends.

5. Recently, the Plaintiff has become aware of concerning and potentially dangerous circumstances regarding Ethan's well-being during visits with the Defendant. Ethan has reported to the Plaintiff instances of "special drinks" at the Defendant's residence and the Defendant's apparent impaired physical state, including an incident where the Defendant was unable to walk straight while carrying Ethan. Furthermore, a concerned neighbor has provided video evidence of the Defendant's concerning behavior while handling Ethan late at night. Additionally, the Plaintiff has received feedback from Ethan's school indicating that he appears exhausted every Monday morning following visits with the Defendant.

6. These alarming events and behaviors indicate a material change in circumstances that necessitates a modification of the current custody arrangement to ensure Ethan's safety and well-being while in the care of the Defendant.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to enter an Order modifying the existing custody arrangement to include supervised or conditional overnights with the Defendant, in the best interest of the minor child.

Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff
