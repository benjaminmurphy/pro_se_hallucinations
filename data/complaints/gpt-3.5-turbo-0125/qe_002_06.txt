Linda Johnson
Defendant

Civil Action No. _______

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Moore, and files this Complaint against the Defendant, Linda Johnson, as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Moore, is a resident of 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. The Defendant, Linda Johnson, is the landlord of the abovementioned rental property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, specifically regarding the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as provided for in MGL c. 186, §14 and relevant case law.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action as the dispute concerns the rental property located in Roxbury, MA, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Housing Court of the City of Boston.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or around November 1, 2025, the Plaintiff noticed water seeping into her basement unit at 123 Maple Street whenever there was heavy rain.

6. The Plaintiff promptly informed the Defendant of the water issue and requested repairs. The Defendant acknowledged the complaint but failed to take necessary action to remedy the situation.

7. Subsequently, a city inspection conducted on an unspecified date confirmed the water issue and discovered additional code violations in the rental property.

8. Due to the persistent water intrusion, the Plaintiff's personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, sustained damages estimated at $400.

9. As a result of the water problem, the Plaintiff was forced to run a dehumidifier continuously, leading to increased electricity costs.

10. The Defendant's refusal to address the water issue in a timely and effective manner has substantially interfered with the Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of the rental premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. The Defendant's failure to adequately respond to and rectify the water issue in the rental property constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a cause of action recognized under MGL c. 186, §14 and supported by Massachusetts case law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against the Defendant for the following relief:

a. Damages in the amount of $400 for the property damage caused;
b. Reimbursement for the increased electricity costs resulting from the water issue;
c. Any additional relief deemed just and equitable by the Court;
d. Costs and attorney's fees pursuant to MGL c. 186, §14; and
e. Any other relief to which the Plaintiff may be entitled.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]
