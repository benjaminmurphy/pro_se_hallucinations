Sarah Johnson
v.
Mark Thompson

Docket No. [to be assigned by the Court]

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, and respectfully states the following Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Thompson:

1. Parties
1.1 The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, is a resident of [Your city and state].
1.2 The Defendant, Mark Thompson, is a resident of [Defendant's city and state].

2. Jurisdiction
2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28.
2.2 The appropriate venue is the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, in accordance with the current custody order.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1 On April 15, 2021, a custody order was entered granting primary custody of the minor child, Emily Johnson, to the Plaintiff, with the Defendant having custody on Wednesdays and every other weekend.
3.2 The current custody arrangement was established based on the parties living in close proximity to each other in the Cambridge area.
3.3 The Defendant now seeks to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while maintaining the same custody schedule, which would result in the minor child facing lengthy drives of approximately ninety minutes each way for midweek overnight visits.
3.4 The minor child, Emily Johnson, has expressed anxiety about the extensive travel and its impact on her after-school activities and well-being.

4. Grounds for Modification
4.1 A material change in circumstances exists warranting modification of the current custody order in the best interest of the minor child, Emily Johnson. 
4.2 The proposed relocation of the Defendant to New Hampshire necessitates a modification of the custody arrangement to provide for a parenting plan that minimizes the adverse effects of long-distance travel on the minor child's physical and emotional well-being.
4.3 It is in the best interest of the minor child to remove the midweek overnight visit and adjust the weekend schedule to accommodate the increased distance between the parties.

5. Requested Relief
5.1 The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visit and adjust the weekend schedule to better suit the parties' new circumstances resulting from the Defendant's relocation to New Hampshire.
5.2 The Plaintiff further requests such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable in the circumstances.

6. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Court:
a. Modify the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visit and adjust the weekend schedule accordingly;
b. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
[Your Signature]
Sarah Johnson, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025
