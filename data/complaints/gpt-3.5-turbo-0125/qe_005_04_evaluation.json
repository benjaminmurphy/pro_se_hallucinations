However, the Supreme Judicial Court ultimately affirms on other grounds (retaliation and Chapter 93A) and does not analyze or discuss the elements of a \u00a7 14 quiet enjoyment claim in any detail. Thus, the case shows that such a claim is cognizable under Massachusetts law in this landlord-tenant context, but it is not strong authority on the substance of that cause of action.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "After her landlord, the plaintiff Nick Haddad, commenced a summary process action... the defendant, Luz Gonzalez, filed six counterclaims alleging: (1) breach of the implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L.c. 186, \u00a7 14 (1990 ed.); ... After a trial, a judge of the Housing Court found in favor of Gonzalez on all of her counterclaims... We now affirm."

It does not discuss, apply, or even mention the Massachusetts covenant of quiet enjoyment, nor does it analyze landlord interference with possession under that doctrine. Therefore, it provides no authority for a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.",

It involves a dispute in Probate Court over enforcement of a separation agreement and retirement-plan related payments, and the opinion addresses subject-matter jurisdiction and contract remedies. Therefore it does not provide authority for a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The plaintiff seeks to recover money due her under a contract in writing. This classically calls for an action at law. The Probate Court has no jurisdiction of actions at law. ... This is an unadorned action in contract which is not cognizable under the general or statutory equity jurisdiction which reposes in the Probate Court.

It does not mention, analyze, or apply the Massachusetts covenant of quiet enjoyment (typically under G.L. c. 186, \u00a714 or common law landlord-tenant doctrine). Therefore it cannot serve as authority for a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",

The defendants appeal from a \u201cjudgment\u201d which awarded benefits under the latter two statutes, annulled the decision of the selectmen denying benefits under G.
