Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby files this Complaint against the Defendant, Lynn Apartments LLC, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Carter, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA.

2. The Defendant, Lynn Apartments LLC, is a business entity that owns and manages the apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as it involves a claim for personal injury and negligence within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in Lynn District Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment due to a kitchen incident, causing smoke to fill the common hallways of the building.

6. Prior to the fire, the smoke detector located outside Plaintiff's unit in the common hallway was chirping due to a low battery. Despite multiple complaints from Plaintiff to the Defendant, the issue was not promptly resolved, and the battery was eventually removed, leaving the hallway without a functional smoke detector.

7. As a result of the inoperable smoke detector, Plaintiff did not receive a warning of the fire and was only alerted by the smell of smoke when the hallway was already filled with thick smoke.

8. Plaintiff experienced smoke inhalation, requiring hospitalization for treatment and suffering from breathing difficulties as a result of the incident.

9. The Defendant's failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector directly contributed to Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. Negligence: The Defendant breached its duty of care owed to the Plaintiff by failing to maintain a working smoke detector in the common areas of the building, which directly resulted in Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $6,200, representing medical expenses of $5,000 and lost wages of $1,200;
2. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper; and
3. Award Plaintiff the costs and disbursements of this action, including reasonable attorney's fees.

Respectfully submitted,
