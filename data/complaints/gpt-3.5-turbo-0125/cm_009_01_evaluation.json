Therefore it does not establish the two\u2011part \u2018material change plus best interests\u2019 standard for modification described in the proposition.",

L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 (1984 ed.), provides that \u2018[a] minor child of divorced parents who is a native of . . . this commonwealth . . . shall not, if of suitable age to signify his consent, be removed out of this commonwealth without such consent, or, if under that age, without the consent of both parents, unless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u2019 The words \u2018upon cause shown\u2019 mean only that removal must be in the best interests of the child (Rubin v. Rubin, 370 Mass. 857 [1976]; Hale v. Hale, supra at 815) \u2026 .\u201d}"
