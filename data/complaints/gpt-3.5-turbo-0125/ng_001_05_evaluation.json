It does not involve premises liability, slip-and-fall law, or any duty to clean up spills or warn customers of hazards. Therefore it cannot support the proposition that a defendant negligently breached a duty of care by failing to promptly clean up spilled milk or warn customers of a hazardous condition.",

It does not involve premises liability, a spill, or a duty to clean up or warn about transient hazards to customers. Therefore, it does not address, establish, or support a rule about a defendant negligently breaching a duty of care by failing to promptly clean spilled milk or warn customers of a hazardous condition.",

Good Samaritan Hospital & Health Center, 39 Ohio St.3d 86, 92, 529 N.E.2d 449 (1988), the trial court noted that to prove negligence in a death claim, a party must establish a duty, breach of that duty, and proximate cause between the breach and the death. The trial court concluded, citing Abbuhl v. Orange Village, 8th Dist. No. 82203, 2003-Ohio-4662, \u00b6 25, that the accident reconstruction expert\u2019s opinion offered by Appellant was speculative and contained mere conjecture\u2026"

It therefore cannot support a proposition about a defendant negligently failing to clean up spilled milk or warn customers. The citation to Brown v.

It does not involve premises liability, duty of care to customers, spills, or negligent failure to clean or warn about hazardous conditions, nor is it Lopez v. Whole Foods Market, Inc. Therefore, it does not support the stated negligence proposition about spilled milk and warnings to customers.",
