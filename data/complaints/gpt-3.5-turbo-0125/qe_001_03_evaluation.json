However, it is a concurrence/dissent, not the majority holding, and it frames the issue as an implied contractual obligation/warranty based on statutes and codes, not as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The excerpt does not establish that failure to provide essential services as required by law constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, so it does not support the proposition as phrased.",

It does not discuss landlord\u2011tenant law, covenants of quiet enjoyment, or any duty to provide essential services. Citing this case as authority on breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is therefore inaccurate and unrelated to the proposition stated.",
