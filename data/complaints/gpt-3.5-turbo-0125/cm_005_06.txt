v.
Mark Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and hereby files this Complaint seeking modification of the existing custody order, as follows:

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
1. This action is brought under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, that grants this Honorable Court jurisdiction over matters concerning child custody modification.
2. The parties are currently subject to a custody order issued by this Court on June 15, 2021.
3. The Plaintiff resides at [Your Address], and the Defendant resides at [Defendant's Address], making this Court the appropriate venue for this action.

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
4. Pursuant to the existing custody order, the parties share legal custody of their minor children, Emma (age 10) and Jake (age 8). The children primarily reside with the Plaintiff and have a visitation schedule with the Defendant.
5. Over the past year, the Defendant has unilaterally signed the children up for activities that conflict with the Plaintiff's scheduled visitation time, resulting in the children missing out on valuable time with the Plaintiff.
6. The Defendant has also engaged in a pattern of behavior designed to alienate the children from the Plaintiff, including making disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff in front of the children, such as labeling the Plaintiff as "selfish" and suggesting that the Plaintiff does not love the children.
7. The Plaintiff has learned that one of the children has begun experiencing physical symptoms, specifically stomach aches, on transition days, which the Plaintiff believes to be a result of the emotional distress caused by the Defendant's behavior.

III. REQUESTED MODIFICATION
8. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the children to the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson.
9. The Plaintiff also seeks modified provisions regarding decision-making authority and scheduling arrangements, to ensure the best interests of the children are adequately protected.

IV. SUPPORTING LAW
10. In support of this request for modification, the Plaintiff cites Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which allows for custody modification upon a showing of a material change in circumstances, particularly where such modification would serve the best interests of the children.
11. Relevant case law supporting the modification of custody orders includes, but is not limited to: Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002); and Loud v. Custody Officer, 437 Mass. 126 (2002).

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the children to the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson.
2. Enter any other orders necessary and appropriate to protect the best interests of the children.

Respectfully submitted,
