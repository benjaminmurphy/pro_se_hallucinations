v.

Daniel Thompson
Defendant

Docket No:  

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully stating as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1 The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], Massachusetts.
1.2 The Defendant, Daniel Thompson, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], Massachusetts.

2. Relevant Background
2.1 On May 15, 2018, this Honorable Court entered a custody order between the parties granting 50/50 physical custody of their minor child, Emily Thompson, with a one-week on and one-week off schedule.
2.2 Subsequently, there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child as outlined herein.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1 Recently, the Defendant was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has significantly compromised their ability to care for the child independently.
3.2 The Defendant has experienced multiple falls at home and has been advised by their physician not to be left alone with the minor child in situations requiring immediate physical response.
3.3 Despite these medical concerns, the Defendant has insisted on maintaining the same 50/50 custody schedule and has at times required the minor child to assist with their mobility and care needs.
3.4 The Plaintiff is concerned for the safety and well-being of the child and believes that it is in the best interest of the child to primarily reside with her, with the Defendant having a modified custody schedule that aligns with their current capabilities.

4. Requested Modification
4.1 The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Thompson, to the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, with the Defendant, Daniel Thompson, having a modified visitation schedule that ensures the safety and well-being of the child.
4.2 The Plaintiff also requests such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

Wherefore, the Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court:
(a) Grants the requested modification of custody order;
(b) Orders such further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances; and
(c) Grants any other relief as this Court deems appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,
