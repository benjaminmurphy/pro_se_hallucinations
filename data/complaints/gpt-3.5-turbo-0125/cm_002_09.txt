Sarah Thompson, Plaintiff  
v.  
Michael Johnson, Defendant  
Docket No. [To Be Assigned]  

Complaint for Modification  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Johnson, alleges as follows:

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and the Defendant, Michael Johnson, are the parents of a minor child, Emily Johnson, born on [Date of Birth], who is subject to a current custody order.

2. The original custody order was entered on June 15, 2021, granting primary custody to the Plaintiff, with the Defendant having parenting time with Emily every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.

3. The Plaintiff and the Defendant reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

4. The Plaintiff avers that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order. The Defendant now intends to move to New Hampshire for a job opportunity, which will significantly impact the current custody arrangement.

5. The Defendant's proposed move to New Hampshire, approximately ninety minutes away, will impose undue burden and hardship on the minor child, Emily Johnson. The midweek overnight visits as currently ordered will require lengthy commutes and disrupt Emily's school schedule and extracurricular activities.

6. The Plaintiff seeks to modify the current custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation and to amend the weekend schedule to accommodate the increased distance between the parties.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the current custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation requirement;
2. Modify the weekend visitation schedule to better suit the circumstances resulting from the Defendant's intended relocation to New Hampshire; and
3. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
