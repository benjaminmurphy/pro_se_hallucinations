IN THE CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX

Jessica Lin, 

Plaintiff,

v.

Michael Thompson,

Defendant.

Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Jessica Lin, by and through undersigned counsel, complains against Defendant, Michael Thompson, as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Lin, is an individual residing at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

2. Defendant, Michael Thompson, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action as the events giving rise to the claims occurred within its jurisdiction.

5. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court as the property subject to this action is located at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on June 1, 2021, to rent an apartment at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, for a monthly rent of $2400.

7. Defendant commenced renovation works on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's apartment approximately two months ago. The construction activities have resulted in ongoing disruptive noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers during weekdays from 8 AM to 5 PM, disrupting Plaintiff's ability to work from home effectively.

8. Despite being informed in advance of the renovation, the continuous noise and disturbances from the construction activities have significantly impacted Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the premises.

9. Plaintiff has experienced dust entering her apartment through the vents as a result of the ongoing renovations, further diminishing the habitability and peaceful enjoyment of the leased premises.

10. In response to the disturbances caused by the construction, Defendant offered a nominal rent reduction of $100 for one month, which does not adequately compensate Plaintiff for the prolonged disruption and interference with her tenancy.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as recognized under Massachusetts law, due to Defendant's failure to provide Plaintiff with the peaceful and undisturbed possession of the leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant, Michael Thompson, as follows:

1. Damages in the amount of $2000 for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
2. Any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
