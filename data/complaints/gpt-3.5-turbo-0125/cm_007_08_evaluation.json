The opinion interprets G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 and articulates the \u201creal advantage\u201d standard and best-interests analysis for allowing a custodial parent to remove children from the Commonwealth after divorce. It does not discuss the standard for modifying existing custody orders based on a substantial change in circumstances, so it does not provide authority for the proposition about modifications of custody orders.",

L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 (1984 ed.), provides that \u2018[a] minor child of divorced parents \u2026 shall not \u2026 be removed out of this commonwealth \u2026 without the consent of both parents, unless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u2019 The words \u2018upon cause shown\u2019 mean only that removal must be in the best interests of the child (Rubin v. Rubin, 370 Mass. 857 [1976]; Hale v. Hale, supra at 815), and thus the central question in this case is how these \u2018best interests\u2019 are to be determined.\u201d"

It nowhere discusses substantial changes in circumstances, the best interests of the child, or any custody framework. Therefore, it does not support the claimed proposition about modification of custody orders.",

It does not discuss or articulate the general principle that the best interests of the child are paramount in custody matters.

L. c. 119, \u00a7 29, and ensure the child\u2019s right to representation by independent counsel.
