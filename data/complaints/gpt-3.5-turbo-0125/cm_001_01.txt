LAURA JOHNSON,
Plaintiff,

v.

MARK THOMPSON,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

COMES NOW, Laura Johnson ("Plaintiff"), for her Complaint for Modification of Custody against Mark Thompson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Mark Thompson, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of two minor children, Emma Johnson (8) and Liam Johnson (6), subject to the custody order in question.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209, Section 37.

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County as the minor children reside within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On March 15, 2021, a custody order was entered by this Court establishing the current custody arrangement.

7. The current custody arrangement grants primary custody to Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, with Defendant, Mark Thompson, having the children every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

8. Plaintiff and Defendant worked regular daytime jobs at the time of the current custody order, which was the basis for the parenting schedule.

9. Defendant has since taken a new job working from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week, including the nights he is supposed to have the children overnight.

10. Due to his work schedule, Defendant has been unable to adequately care for the children during his scheduled overnights. He has either left the children with his roommate, with whom Plaintiff has minimal familiarity, or has had the children sleep on the couch while he rests from his overnight shift.

11. The children have informed Plaintiff that they have fallen asleep on the couch unsupervised while in Defendant's care.

REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

12. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to modify the existing custody order to ensure that overnights with Defendant only occur when he is not working and fully able to supervise the children.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
 - Modify the existing custody order to reflect the best interests of the children by limiting overnights with Defendant;
 - Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025
