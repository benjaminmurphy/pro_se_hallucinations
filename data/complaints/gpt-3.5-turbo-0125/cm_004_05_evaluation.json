Custody of Vaughn, as excerpted here, is actually a criminal case involving a murder conviction and felony-murder instructions, not a probate/family law custody dispute. The opinion does not discuss custody standards, best-interests analysis, or modification of custody orders, so it cannot support the stated custody proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "A jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree by reason of felony-murder. The defendant was also convicted of armed robbery. On appeal, he contends that the trial judge committed error when he failed to: (1) give a requested instruction on assault and battery; (2) give an instruction on involuntary manslaughter; and (3) supplement the given instruction on murder in the second degree."

Wick, 443 Mass. 177 (2005), addresses criminal law issues involving a surety\u2019s authority to apprehend and detain a bail principal, not family law, custody, or best-interests standards. The case thus provides no authority for the requested custody modification and is being cited out of context for that proposition.",

First, do a surety and his agents have the lawful authority to apprehend, detain, and deliver the principal to the court house? \u2026 [A] surety and his agents may use only such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to apprehend, detain, and deliver the principal to the court house\u2026.\u201d"

It does not involve or decide a petition to modify an existing custody order between parents, nor does it discuss the general standard for modification of custody. While it uses a best-interests framework in the grandparent-visitation context, it provides no authority for a generic request that a court modify a custody order in a child\u2019s best interests.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe statute adopts the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard as the test for determining visitation. This standard has long been used in Massachusetts to decide issues of custody and visitation and other issues relating to child welfare. The statute, however, uses the standard in a new context\u2026 To accord with due process, an evaluation of the best interests of the child under the statute requires that a parental decision concerning grandparent visitation be given presumptive validity.\u201d"

The cited opinion is a Massachusetts criminal case about online dissemination of obscene material and enticement of a minor, and it does not mention Lucas Smith, custody, visitation, or any child\u2019s wishes about overnight stays.

Rolde v. Rolde is a Massachusetts appellate decision about divorce, division of marital assets, and custody/visitation arrangements between Dr. Alexandra and Dr. Edward Rolde\u2019s children; it does not mention Lucas Smith, his age, school attendance, or any expressed desire for overnight stays. The case provides general principles on custody and visitation but does not establish or affirm the factual proposition stated.",

Following an eight-day trial the judge awarded sole custody of the children to the wife, limited Edward\u2019s visitation rights to two weeks in the summer, and eliminated evening visitation during the alternate weeks on which there is weekend visitation; the holiday schedule remained the same.\u201d"

It does not involve child custody, parenting plans, visitation schedules, or any modification of custody arrangements, much less alternating weekends and weekday overnights tied to a child\u2019s school schedule or preferences. Therefore, it provides no authority for the stated custody/visitation proposition.",

It does not discuss child custody, standards for modification of custody, or any requirement of a material or significant change in circumstances. Therefore, this citation does not support the proposition about changed circumstances warranting modification of a custody order.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Given the court\u2019s ruling, it may make sense for our rules committee to reexamine the rule on impounded appeals, S.J.C. Rule 1:15. I am concerned that the rule as it is currently written may give parties and nonparties who have obtained impoundment orders in the trial court a false sense of assurance that the impoundment will be honored by the appellate court if it is not being challenged. Perhaps the rule should be changed to require one who has obtained an impoundment order in the trial court to apply anew to the appellate court for impoundment of the appeal."

It does not state that both parents acknowledge the necessity of modifying the custody arrangement due to the child\u2019s growth or evolving circumstances; rather, it notes that both parents agreed to try joint legal custody with a mediator and a specific caveat about future changes. That is an agreement on a particular arrangement, not a mutual acknowledgment of a need for modification based on changed circumstances over time.",
