COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Smith, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant Linda Johnson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is a resident of Massachusetts with an address at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Defendant Linda Johnson is a property owner residing in Worcester, Massachusetts, with an address at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of an incident that occurred on February 15, 2023, at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, falling within the jurisdiction of the Worcester District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff Jordan Smith was delivering groceries to a tenant at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, MA.

5. The Defendant, as the property owner of 45 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, owed a duty to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition.

6. Following a snowstorm, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk; however, she did not apply salt or sand to prevent the formation of ice.

7. The narrow path created by Defendant turned into a sheet of ice due to melting during the day and refreezing at night.

8. Despite being informed by the tenants and receiving pictures of the hazardous condition, Defendant negligently disregarded the dangerous situation, stating "the sun will take care of it."

9. When Plaintiff walked up the sidewalk, he slipped on the ice patch, causing him to fall backward and sustain an injury to his lower back, resulting in pain and limited mobility.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. Defendant breached her duty of care and was negligent by failing to properly maintain the sidewalk and address the hazardous ice conditions, directly causing harm to Plaintiff.

11. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to the laws of Massachusetts, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 84, Section 15, which imposes a duty to keep sidewalks safe for public use.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Smith respectfully prays for the following relief:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $3,500, representing $2,500 for medical expenses and $1,000 for lost wages;
b. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest at the statutory rate;
c. Costs and expenses of this action; and
d. Any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.
