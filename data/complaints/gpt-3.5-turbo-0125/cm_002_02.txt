LAURA THOMPSON, Plaintiff
v.
MARK DAVIS, Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, by and through the undersigned legal assistant, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Davis, states as follows:

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, and the Defendant, Mark Davis, are the parents of Sophie Davis, born on [Date of Birth], and are parties to a custody order entered by this Honorable Court on March 15, 2020.

2. Pursuant to the current custody order, the Plaintiff has primary custody of Sophie, with the Defendant having custody on Wednesdays and every other weekend. The current custody arrangement was established based on the parties' close proximity in Cambridge, to facilitate regular school attendance and after-school activities.

3. The Plaintiff now respectfully seeks a modification of the existing custody order due to a substantial change in circumstances. The Defendant, Mark Davis, has informed the Plaintiff of his intention to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while still seeking to maintain the same custody schedule that requires Sophie to endure lengthy and stressful drives for midweek overnights.

4. The proposed arrangement, which involves Sophie traveling approximately ninety minutes each way for midweek overnights and then rushing back for school the next morning, is not in the best interest of the child. Sophie has already begun experiencing anxiety regarding these extensive and disruptive travels, which also interfere with her ability to engage in after-school activities and maintain a stable routine.

5. The Plaintiff seeks to modify the custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation and to adjust the weekend schedule to ensure minimal disruption and stress on Sophie, reflecting the new geographic constraints created by the Defendant's planned relocation to New Hampshire.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
(a) Modify the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation;
(b) Adjust the weekend visitation schedule to accommodate the parties' new living arrangements in light of the Defendant's relocation to New Hampshire;
(c) Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025
