SUPERIOR COURT 
WORCESTER COUNTY

Emily Johnson,  
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Smith,  
Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff"), and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Smith ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

2. Defendant, Michael Smith, is an individual who owns and manages the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605, where Plaintiff is a tenant.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This court has jurisdiction over this matter as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this court.

4. Venue is proper in Worcester County as the subject property is located in Worcester, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605, starting on January 15, 2022.

6. Since approximately three months ago, Plaintiff has repeatedly informed Defendant about a recurring rodent infestation issue in the kitchen area of the leased premises, specifically noting mouse droppings.

7. Defendant's response to the rodent infestation has been inadequate and insufficient. Defendant has only minimally addressed the issue by placing a few traps and hiring an exterminator for one visit despite the ongoing presence of mouse droppings.

8. The exterminator has advised Plaintiff that more comprehensive treatment is necessary to effectively address the rodent infestation, which Defendant has failed to undertake claiming it to be unnecessary and costly.

9. Plaintiff has incurred financial damages as a result of the rodent infestation, including having to discard approximately $200 worth of food due to contamination by rodents and the purchase of plastic containers costing approximately $80 to prevent further contamination.

10. Despite Plaintiff's persistent complaints and requests for proper remediation, Defendant's inaction and failure to address the ongoing rodent infestation issue have caused Plaintiff significant distress and interference with her enjoyment of the leased premises.

CLAIM

11. Defendant's actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied by law in every residential lease agreement under Massachusetts law.

RELEVANT LAW

12. Massachusetts General Laws Ch. 186, § 14(1) states that every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, entitling a tenant to peaceful and undisturbed possession of the leased premises.

13. Caselaw such as Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 N.E.2d 1313 (Mass. 1977) and Phipps v. Clark, 390 Mass. 998 (1983) reaffirm the landlord's duty to maintain leased premises in a habitable condition under the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

a. Award damages in the amount of $280 for financial losses incurred by Plaintiff;
b. Order Defendant to undertake comprehensive rodent extermination measures in the leased premises;
c. Grant such further relief as the court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
