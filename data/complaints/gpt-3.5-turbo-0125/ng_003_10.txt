PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Ryan Thompson is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. is a business entity registered in Massachusetts, with a principal place of business at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 218, § 4.

4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court because the incident occurred at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at Discount Home Goods, Inc. located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, Plaintiff Ryan Thompson was browsing the store's kitchen goods aisle.

6. Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. had heavy boxes of appliances stacked without any straps or barriers at elevated heights on the shelves in close proximity to where customers walk.

7. Another customer, while pushing a cart down the aisle, negligently bumped into one of the lower shelves, causing a large toaster-oven box to fall from near the top shelf onto Plaintiff's shoulder and head.

8. As a result of the falling box, Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a severe headache, leading him to seek medical attention at the emergency room the same day.

9. Medical examination revealed that Plaintiff suffered a mild concussion and a shoulder strain due to the incident.

10. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $800 in wages due to missed work as a delivery driver and inability to engage in physical activities, including his participation in a soccer league for about a month.
