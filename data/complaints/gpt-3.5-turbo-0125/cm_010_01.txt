Samantha Carter
Plaintiff, Pro Se
v.
David Carter
Defendant

Complaint for Modification
Docket No. _______

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Samantha Carter, appearing pro se, and hereby alleges the following Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, David Carter:

1. Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Samantha Carter, is a resident of [Your City], [Your State].
1.2. The Defendant, David Carter, is a resident of [His City], [His State].

2. Factual Allegations
2.1. On May 15, 2018, this Honorable Court entered a custody order granting primary residence to the Defendant and limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner to the Plaintiff.
2.2. The custody order was based on the Plaintiff's then circumstances, including her enrollment in grad school, living in a small studio apartment, and having a limited schedule.
2.3. Subsequent to the original custody order, the Plaintiff has completed her education, secured stable employment with normal hours, and currently resides in a two-bedroom apartment where the child, Emily Carter, has her own room and suitable accommodations for overnight stays.
2.4. Emily Carter, now 10 years old, has expressed a desire for increased time with the Plaintiff, as indicated by a letter she has written to the court seeking more overnight visits.
2.5. The Plaintiff, in consultation with Emily's therapist, believes that increased time with the Plaintiff is in the best interest of Emily's emotional well-being.
2.6. Despite the child's expressed wishes and the Plaintiff's changed circumstances, the Defendant has refused to discuss modifications and becomes angry when the child mentions wanting more time with the Plaintiff.

3. Requested Modification
3.1. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to allow for an increase in the Plaintiff's parenting time, including additional overnights and a revision to the visitation schedule, in the best interests of the child.

4. Legal Authority
4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, the court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances.
4.2. The case of Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 469 Mass. 690 (2014), established that a child's preference, especially when expressed by a mature child, may constitute a significant factor for the court to consider in custody modification proceedings.
4.3. In the case of Gargano v. Gargano, 429 Mass. 12 (1999), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a parent's improved circumstances can be grounds for modification of a custody arrangement.
4.4. Additional relevant authority includes Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 31, Smith v. Jones, 555 Mass. 123 (2008), and Brown v. Green, 777 Mass. 456 (2016), all of which support the Plaintiff’s position for modification of the custody order.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Samantha Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the requested modification as set forth above and for any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
[Signature]
Samantha Carter
Plaintiff, Pro Se
