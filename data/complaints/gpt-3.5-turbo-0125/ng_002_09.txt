Jessica Freeman,
Plaintiff

v.

Tom Holland,
Defendant

Case No: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Jessica Freeman, by and through undersigned counsel, and complains of the Defendant, Tom Holland, as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Freeman, is a resident of the State of Massachusetts, residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. The Defendant, Tom Holland, is a resident of the State of Massachusetts, residing at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. The amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court. Venue is proper in Newton District Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at Oak Hill Park, 123 Oak Street, Newton, MA, on July 15, 2023.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On the aforementioned date, Jessica Freeman was jogging in Oak Hill Park, a public park in Newton, Massachusetts. Signs in the park required all dogs to be kept on leashes at all times.

5. The Defendant, Tom Holland, was present in the park with his unleashed dog, despite the posted requirements for leash usage. The dog suddenly charged at the Plaintiff, barking loudly and in an aggressive manner.

6. The Defendant, while present approximately thirty feet away from the dog, failed to have the dog on a leash and under control, allowing it to charge at the Plaintiff.

7. Fearing for her safety, the Plaintiff swerved off the path to avoid the charging dog. In doing so, she tripped over a tree root and fell down a small embankment, resulting in a fractured wrist.

8. The Defendant failed to take timely action to restrain the dog, only calling it back after the Plaintiff had already fallen and incurred injuries.

9. The Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for the treatment of her fractured wrist and lost approximately $1,200 in wages from missed work due to the injury.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. The Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff to maintain his dog under control and on a leash in accordance with the park regulations.

11. The Defendant breached this duty by allowing his dog to be unleashed and charge at the Plaintiff, causing her to swerve off the path and sustain injuries.

12. The Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff's injuries.

13. The Defendant's actions constitute negligence under Massachusetts common law and statutory law, including but not limited to M.G.L. c. 140, §155.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Freeman, respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against the Defendant, Tom Holland, for:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $3,700;
b. Interest on the compensatory damages as allowed by law;
c. Costs and reasonable attorney's fees; and
d. Any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
