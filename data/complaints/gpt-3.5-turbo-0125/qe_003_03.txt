SUPERIOR COURT DEPARTMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT
COUNTY OF SUFFOLK

Alex Rivera, Plaintiff

v.

Jordan Morgan, Defendant

Case No.: [to be filled by the court]

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Alex Rivera, and for his complaint against the Defendant, Jordan Morgan, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Alex Rivera, is a resident of Massachusetts, residing at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. The Defendant, Jordan Morgan, is the landlord of the Plaintiff's rented unit located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter because the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the Boston Municipal Court, Jamaica Plain Division.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about February 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, for a monthly rent of $1500.

5. During the showing of the apartment, the Plaintiff noticed water stains on the ceiling and inquired about them. The Defendant assured the Plaintiff that any past leaks had been fully repaired.

6. Subsequent to moving in, the Plaintiff experienced ongoing issues with water leakage from the ceiling during rainstorms, causing damage to personal property, including a couch and a laptop that cost approximately $900 to replace.

7. Despite the Plaintiff's complaints to the Defendant about the water leakage, the Defendant has failed to adequately address the issue, dismissing it as a "cosmetic problem."

8. The continual water leakage has led to a musty odor in the apartment, potential mold growth, and health issues for the Plaintiff, necessitating the Plaintiff to rearrange living arrangements and limit the use of parts of the apartment.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

10. The Defendant's failure to adequately address the water leakage issue, as previously acknowledged by the Plaintiff and not rectified by the Defendant, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor against the Defendant, as follows:

a. Monetary damages in the amount of approximately $900 for property damage and relocation costs.
b. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

DATED: December 1, 2025
