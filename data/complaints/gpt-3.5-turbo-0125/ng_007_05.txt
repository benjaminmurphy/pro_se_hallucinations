COMPLAINT

Now comes Plaintiff, Ethan Johnson, and for his Complaint against Defendant, Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Ethan Johnson, is a resident of Massachusetts and resides at [Your Address], [City, State, ZIP].

2. Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a community center located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 3, as the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this court.

4. Venue is proper in Bristol County Superior Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at the aforementioned location, Plaintiff's minor son was enrolled in an after-school program provided by Defendant at its community center.

6. Defendant advertised that children in the program would be supervised at all times in the gym area.

7. On the day in question, there were supposed to be two staff members supervising approximately twenty children in the gym. One staff member left to do paperwork in the office, leaving one staff member to supervise the children.

8. Despite being informed by other children that two older boys were engaging in a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor, the remaining staff member failed to take appropriate action, dismissing the behavior by saying "boys will be boys."

9. As a result of the inadequate supervision, Plaintiff's eight-year-old son, who is small for his age, was tackled forcefully by one of the older boys, resulting in a head injury that caused him to lose consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.

10. The minor Plaintiff was subsequently rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with a concussion, leading to medical expenses totaling approximately $4,500 and resulting in the loss of $1,200 in wages for Plaintiff.

CAUSES OF ACTION

11. Defendant owed a duty of care to the minor Plaintiff to provide adequate supervision and ensure a safe environment during the after-school program.

12. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to properly supervise the children, allowing dangerous behavior to occur, and disregarding warnings of the risky conduct.

13. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the minor Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

14. As a result of Defendant's negligence, the minor Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, medical expenses, and lost wages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Ethan Johnson respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

a. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for compensatory damages in the amount of $5,700, plus interest and costs as allowed by law;
b. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
