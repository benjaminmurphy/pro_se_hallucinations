Michael Thornton
Defendant

Docket No.:

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Thornton, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip].

2. The Defendant, Michael Thornton, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip].

3. The minor child of the parties is Emma Thornton, age 12, born on [Emma's Date of Birth].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, § 28, granting the Probate and Family Court jurisdiction over matters of custody and support.

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County, Massachusetts, as the minor child, Emma Thornton, resides within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On June 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order granting the parties 50/50 physical custody of the minor child, Emma Thornton, on a one-week-on, one-week-off basis.

7. The current custody arrangement is no longer in the best interests of the minor child due to a material change in circumstances.
  
8. Recently, the Defendant, Michael Thornton, was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that severely limits his physical abilities and poses a risk to his safety and the safety of the minor child, Emma Thornton.

9. The Defendant's condition has worsened to the point where he has fallen multiple times at home, prompting medical advice that he should not be left alone with the minor child, especially in situations requiring quick physical response.

10. Despite medical advice, the Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the 50/50 custody schedule and at times relies on the minor child's assistance in physical tasks that exceed her age-appropriate responsibilities.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

11. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to provide for a primary physical custody arrangement in favor of the Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, with reasonable visitation rights granted to the Defendant, Michael Thornton, based on his physical limitations and the best interests of the minor child.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests the following relief:

a. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton;
b. Provide for appropriate visitation rights to the Defendant, Michael Thornton, in consideration of his physical limitations;
c. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Lisa Thornton, Plaintiff
