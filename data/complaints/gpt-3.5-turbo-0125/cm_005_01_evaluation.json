Blixt and does not concern custody or modification standards; it addresses standing of a planning board to challenge a comprehensive permit under Massachusetts zoning and affordable housing statutes. It nowhere discusses custody orders, substantial and material changes in circumstances, or the best interests of children. Accordingly, this case, as excerpted, does not support the claimed proposition about modification of custody orders.",

We conclude that it does not have standing to contest the comprehensive permit and the violations of the zoning bylaws because it is not a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d For purposes of interpreting the term \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under the comprehensive permit statute, we look to interpretation of the identical term in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17."
