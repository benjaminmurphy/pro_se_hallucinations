Jessica Turner  
Plaintiff  

v.  

Mark Johnson  
Defendant  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, by and through the undersigned counsel, hereby filing this Complaint for Modification of the Custody Order entered on May 15, 2018, in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28 and relevant case law.

1. The Parties  
The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, resides at [Your Address], [City, State, ZIP Code]. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides at [His Address], [City, State, ZIP Code].

2. Facts  
a. On May 15, 2018, this Honorable Court entered a custody order granting primary physical custody of the parties' minor child, Ethan Johnson, aged 8, to the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, and awarding the Defendant, Mark Johnson, three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon, with no overnights due to a lack of suitable living space.

b. Since the entry of the custody order, circumstances have materially changed. Specifically, Ethan Johnson, now 8 years old, is in school full-time and has begun expressing a desire for overnight visits at his father's residence, where he now has his own bedroom.

c. The current custody arrangement, which involves frequent shuttling of Ethan back and forth for short visits during school nights, has become impractical and disruptive to his school life, homework, and bedtime routines. Both parties acknowledge the necessity and benefits of modifying the custody arrangement to better suit Ethan's age, school commitments, and preference for overnight stays.

3. Requested Modification  
The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to allow for overnight stays with the Defendant, Mark Johnson, and to adjust the visitation schedule to better accommodate Ethan's school schedule and daily routines, in the best interests of the child.

4. Prayer for Relief  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Court grant the requested modification of the custody order in accordance with the changes in circumstances, and for any such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

[Your Signature]  
Jessica Turner, Plaintiff  
Date: December 1, 2025
