COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, [Your Full Name], by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against the Defendant [Landlord's Name], states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, [Your Full Name], is an individual residing at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA 02143.

2. The Defendant, [Landlord's Name], is the landlord of the Plaintiff's residence located at the above address.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts regarding landlord-tenant relationships.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the subject property is located within the jurisdiction of the Somerville District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On January 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant for a residential apartment at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA 02143, for a monthly rent of $1,800.

6. The Plaintiff is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, which requires the landlord to ensure that the tenant's right to peaceful and quiet possession of the premises is not disturbed.

7. Since approximately six months ago, the tenants residing in the apartment above the Plaintiff have been consistently loud, causing disturbances at all hours of the day and night.

8. Despite the Plaintiff's repeated complaints to the Defendant about the excessive noise, the Defendant has failed to take effective measures to remedy the situation.

9. The constant noise and disturbances from the upstairs tenants have significantly disrupted the Plaintiff's ability to rest and sleep, leading to adverse consequences such as sleep deprivation, performance issues at work, and financial expenses for sleep medication.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. The Defendant's failure to address the ongoing noise disturbances constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential lease agreement in Massachusetts.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant for damages in the amount of $1,200, representing the financial losses and emotional distress suffered by the Plaintiff due to the breach of quiet enjoyment.

b. Order the Defendant to take immediate and effective action to abate the noise disturbances caused by the upstairs tenants.

c. Award the Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.
