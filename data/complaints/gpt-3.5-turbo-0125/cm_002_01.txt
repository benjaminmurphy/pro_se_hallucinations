Samantha Reed
Plaintiff

v.

Kyle Turner
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Samantha Reed, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Kyle Turner, alleges as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. Plaintiff, Samantha Reed, is a resident of [City], Massachusetts.
1.2. Defendant, Kyle Turner, is a resident of [City], New Hampshire.
1.3. The parties are the parents of their minor child, Emily Turner, born on [Child's Birthdate].

2. Factual Background
2.1. Pursuant to a custody order entered on April 15, 2021, the Plaintiff has been granted primary custody of Emily Turner, and the Defendant has visitation rights on Wednesdays and every other weekend.
2.2. The current custody agreement was established when both parties resided in the Cambridge area where Emily attended school.
2.3. The Defendant has since informed the Plaintiff of his intention to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while maintaining the existing custody schedule, which would require Emily to endure lengthy drives for midweek overnights, causing her undue stress and anxiety.
2.4. Emily's well-being and ability to participate in extracurricular activities are being negatively impacted by the proposed visitation schedule.

3. Request for Modification
3.1. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and adjust the weekend visitation schedule to minimize the impact of the long-distance move on Emily's well-being.

4. Legal Basis
4.1. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a custody order if there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order that warrants a modification in the best interests of the child.
4.2. Relevant case law, such as Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), emphasizes the paramount consideration of the child's best interests in custody modification proceedings.
4.3. Additionally, Perocchi v. Newman, 201 Mass. App. Ct. 251 (2011), provides guidance on the impact of relocation on custody arrangements.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the existing custody order in accordance with the relief sought herein.

Respectfully submitted,
