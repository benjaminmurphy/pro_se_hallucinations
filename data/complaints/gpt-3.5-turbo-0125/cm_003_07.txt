COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, in propria persona, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Smith, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is a resident of [Your City], Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is a resident of [Defendant's City], Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of Liam Smith, a minor child born on [Liam's Date of Birth].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209, Section 38, which provides for jurisdiction over matters of custody of minor children.

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223, Section 1.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On September 15, 2021, this Court entered an order granting the parties shared legal custody of Liam Smith, with Liam primarily residing with the Plaintiff and visiting the Defendant on weekends.

7. Since the issuance of the custody order, there have been material changes in circumstances that warrant modification of the existing order.

8. The Plaintiff has become concerned for Liam's safety and well-being based on reports from Liam and a neighbor regarding incidents at the Defendant's residence.

9. Liam has reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant has "special drinks" at his house, and on occasion, the Defendant "can't walk straight." Additionally, a neighbor provided video evidence showing the Defendant stumbling while taking Liam out of the car late at night.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to:

(a) Modify the existing custody order to include supervised or conditioned overnights with the Defendant; and
