IN THE BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT
DORCHESTER DIVISION

Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff

v.

Mark Reynolds, Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Ms. Thompson"), by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Reynolds ("Mr. Reynolds"), alleges the following based on information and belief:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Ms. Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. Defendant Mr. Mark Reynolds is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21, as the actions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Ms. Thompson entered into a lease agreement with Mr. Reynolds on June 1, 2022, to rent a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124, for a monthly rent of $1,800.

5. Since winter of 2024, Ms. Thompson has experienced recurring issues with the heating system in the leased premises. Despite repairs attempted by Mr. Reynolds, the heat in the apartment frequently drops to below standard levels, leading to uncomfortable and unhealthy living conditions.

6. On two occasions, Mr. Reynolds sent repair personnel to address the heating issues. However, the problem persists, with the latest repairman noting that the boiler in the building is "old but functional" with limited capabilities to maintain a consistent and adequate heating level.

7. As a result of the inadequate heating, Ms. Thompson had to purchase two space heaters to mitigate the cold temperatures, resulting in an increase in her monthly electricity bill by approximately $150.

8. Furthermore, the cold indoor temperatures exacerbated Ms. Thompson's health conditions, leading to a bout of bronchitis in January 2025. Her doctor attributed the illness to the cold indoor air, resulting in missed workdays and medical expenses.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Based on the facts outlined above, Ms. Thompson asserts a cause of action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts law. 

LEGAL AUTHORITY

10. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14 guarantees tenants the right to quiet enjoyment, which includes the right to have essential services such as heat provided in a habitable condition.

11. Relevant case law, including Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) and Tenneco West, Inc. v. Millison, 361 Mass. 160 (1972), establishes that a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when a landlord fails to provide essential services as required by law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

a. An award of damages in the amount of $600, representing the increased electricity costs and medical expenses incurred due to the inadequate heating system.
b. Any further relief that the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
