Plaintiff  

v.  

James Greene  
Defendant  


COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Samantha Greene, and files this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, James Greene, respectfully requesting this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order based on the following facts:

1. The Parties:  
1.1 Plaintiff, Samantha Greene, is a resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
1.2 Defendant, James Greene, is also a resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

2. Minor Child:  
2.1 The parties share a minor child, Emily Greene, aged 12, born on [Date of Birth].  

3. Original Custody Order:  
3.1 On May 15, 2018, this Court entered an order granting the parties 50/50 physical custody of Emily Greene, with custody alternating on a weekly basis.  

4. Material Change in Circumstances:  
4.1 Since the entry of the original custody order, a material change in circumstances has occurred.  
4.2 Specifically, Defendant, James Greene, has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that impairs their physical abilities.  
4.3 Due to this condition, Defendant has experienced multiple falls at home and has been advised by medical professionals not to be alone with the minor child near stairs or in situations requiring quick physical response.  
4.4 Despite these limitations, Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the existing 50/50 custody schedule and at times relies on the minor child to assist with physical tasks beyond her capabilities.  

5. Requested Modification:  
5.1 Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to modify the existing custody order to prioritize the minor child's safety and well-being.  
5.2 Plaintiff seeks primary physical custody of Emily Greene, with reasonable visitation for Defendant that aligns with their physical limitations and ensures the minor child's safety.  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to grant the following relief:

a. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to Plaintiff, Samantha Greene;  
b. Grant reasonable visitation rights to Defendant, James Greene, taking into consideration their physical limitations; and  
c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
