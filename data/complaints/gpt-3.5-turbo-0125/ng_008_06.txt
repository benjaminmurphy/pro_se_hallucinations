IN THE NORFOLK SUPERIOR COURT
SUNNY BISTRO LLC,
Plaintiff,

v.

MARK JOHNSON,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, SUNNY BISTRO LLC (“Plaintiff”), by and through undersigned counsel, and for its Complaint against the Defendant, MARK JOHNSON (“Defendant”), alleges and states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, SUNNY BISTRO LLC, is a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of Massachusetts, with its principal place of business located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169.

2. Defendant, MARK JOHNSON, is a resident of Massachusetts, residing at [Your Address].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, Section 3, and Chapter 223, Section 2.

4. Venue is proper in Norfolk County as the incident giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169, within the jurisdiction of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, Defendant, MARK JOHNSON, was a patron at Plaintiff’s restaurant located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169.

6. On the aforementioned date, at said restaurant, a server of Plaintiff negligently dropped a tray with several water glasses in a narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.

7. Subsequently, the server failed to clean up the water and ice spilled on the tile floor, or to place any warning signs to alert patrons of the dangerous condition.

8. Approximately ten minutes after the spill, Defendant, unaware of the unaddressed hazard, attempted to navigate through the hallway to use the restroom, ultimately slipping on the wet surface and sustaining a severe knee sprain.

9. It was later revealed that other staff members of Plaintiff were aware of the hazardous conditions in the hallway and had been "dodging that puddle," further indicating Plaintiff’s negligence in addressing and correcting the dangerous situation.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

11. Defendant alleges that Plaintiff breached its duty of care owed to Defendant by failing to maintain safe conditions in its establishment, failing to promptly clean up spilled water, and failing to warn patrons of the dangerous condition, leading to Defendant’s injuries.

12. The actions and inactions of Plaintiff constitute negligence under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in its favor and against Defendant, MARK JOHNSON, as follows:

a. Awarding compensatory damages in the amount of approximately $1,800 for medical expenses incurred by Defendant due to the knee sprain;
b. Awarding compensatory damages in the amount of approximately $500 for lost wages suffered by Defendant as a result of the injury;
c. Awarding pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on the damages awarded;
