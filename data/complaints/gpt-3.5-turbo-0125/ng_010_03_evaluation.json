It is a lengthy opinion on Massachusetts legacy and succession tax statutes and the constitutionality and application of those tax provisions.

It does not involve premises liability, falling objects from a building, or a property owner\u2019s duty to maintain safe premises or prevent foreseeable harm. The proposition mischaracterizes the subject matter and holding of the case.",

The master found that this statement was false and known to be false by the defendant; that he had paid nothing for the stock ... The master found further that the corporation performed its part of the contract by delivery of the certificate and that the defendant was liable for $9,400 on the subscription contract.\""
