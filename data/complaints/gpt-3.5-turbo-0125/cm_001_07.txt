Laura Matthews  
Plaintiff  

v.  

Daniel Parker  
Defendant  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Matthews, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Daniel Parker, alleges and states as follows:

1. Parties: The Plaintiff, Laura Matthews, and the Defendant, Daniel Parker, are the parents of two children, namely Emily, aged 8, and Jacob, aged 6.

2. Background: The original custody order between the parties was entered on May 15, 2021, establishing a shared custody arrangement where the Plaintiff has primary custody, and the Defendant has overnight visits every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

3. Material Change in Circumstances: The Plaintiff avers that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order. Specifically, the Defendant has taken a new job working evening shifts from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week, including the nights he is supposed to have overnight custody of the children. The Defendant has been unable to fulfill his parenting responsibilities due to his work schedule, resulting in the children being inadequately supervised and cared for during his custodial periods.

4. Requested Modification: The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to ensure that overnight visits with the children only occur when the Defendant is not working and available to provide proper care and supervision.

5. Legal Basis: Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children. Case law such as Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) and Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002) supports the proposition that a modification may be warranted when a parent's work schedule significantly impacts their ability to parent effectively.

6. Prayer for Relief: Wherefore, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to ensure the best interests of the children are met by limiting overnight visits with the Defendant to times when he is not working and fully available to care for the children.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests the Court to enter an order modifying the existing custody order in accordance with the allegations and relief sought herein.

Respectfully submitted,
