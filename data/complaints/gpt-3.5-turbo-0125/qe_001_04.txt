Case No. ___________

JESSICA THOMPSON

Plaintiff,

v.

THOMAS WRIGHT

Defendant.

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, by and through undersigned legal assistant, and complains of the Defendant, Thomas Wright, as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a tenant residing at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. The Defendant, Thomas Wright, is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 239, Section 2A, which provides jurisdiction over actions involving the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court as the subject premises are located in Dorchester, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124, for a monthly rent of $1600.

6. Since the inception of the lease, Plaintiff has experienced repeated issues with the heating in the premises. Despite two repair attempts by Defendant, the heating system consistently malfunctions, causing the temperature to drop significantly, leading to discomfort and health issues for Plaintiff.

7. The first repair attempt temporarily alleviated the issue, but the problem recurred shortly afterward. The second repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was old but functional, indicating that further repairs may not fully resolve the heating deficiencies.

8. Due to the inadequate heating, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain a livable temperature, resulting in an additional monthly cost of approximately $150 in electricity expenses.

9. The cold indoor temperatures caused by the recurring heating issues contributed to Plaintiff contracting bronchitis in January 2025, requiring medical treatment and causing her to miss three days of work. Plaintiff’s doctor attributed the exacerbation of her health condition to the insufficient heating in the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Plaintiff alleges a single cause of action for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as articulated in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, which guarantees tenants the right to a habitable living environment including adequate heat. The repeated failures of the heating system constitute a violation of this covenant.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court grant the following relief:

a. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff for damages in the amount of $900, representing the additional expenses incurred due to the deficient heating system.

b. Any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
