COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Jessica Adams, by and through undersigned counsel, alleges the following Complaint against Defendant, Mark Thompson:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Adams, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

2. Defendant, Mark Thompson, is the landlord of the aforementioned property and a resident of Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, Section 21. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court as the Property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

5. The lease agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing Plaintiff the right to quiet enjoyment of the premises.

6. Since the people residing in the apartment above Plaintiff have moved in approximately six months ago, they have consistently engaged in disruptive conduct, including loud stomping, late-night music playing, and furniture moving at unreasonable hours.

7. Plaintiff has made numerous complaints to Defendant regarding the excessive noise disturbances caused by the upstairs tenants, resulting in a direct violation of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment as stipulated in the lease agreement.

8. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant has failed to take adequate measures to address the ongoing noise issue, stating that he "can't control how people live."

9. The excessive noise disturbances have significantly impacted Plaintiff’s quality of life, causing sleep deprivation, resulting in a written warning at work, and necessitating the purchase of sleep medication costing $40 a month.

10. Plaintiff has attempted various mitigation measures, such as using earplugs and a white noise machine, without success in alleviating the disturbances.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Plaintiff hereby asserts a claim against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $2,500;
b. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
c. Reasonable attorney's fees and costs;

Respectfully submitted,
