IN THE CHELSEA DISTRICT COURT

Jessica Hartman
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Thompson
Defendant

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Jessica Hartman, by and through undersigned counsel, for her complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Hartman, is an individual residing at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, MA 02150.

2. Defendant, Michael Thompson, is the landlord of the above-mentioned premises.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21.

4. Venue is proper in the Chelsea District Court as the subject premises are located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about two months ago, Plaintiff notified Defendant about a broken lock on the main entry door of the building located at 45 Washington Avenue. Despite assurances from Defendant that the lock would be fixed, no repair has been made to date.

6. Subsequent to the notification, an incident occurred wherein an unauthorized individual gained access to the building due to the broken lock. Several residents, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the hallway, resulting in a loss of approximately $120 for Plaintiff.

7. Plaintiff discovered evidence indicating that an unauthorized individual has been unlawfully residing in the basement of the building, causing fear and distress.

8. Concerned for her safety and security, Plaintiff purchased a security camera and a better deadbolt at her own expense totaling approximately $200 to secure her own dwelling.

CAUSE OF ACTION

9. Plaintiff alleges a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by Defendant under Massachusetts law. The broken lock on the main entry door, unauthorized access, theft of packages, and presence of an unauthorized individual in the basement have substantially interfered with Plaintiff's right to peacefully and safely enjoy her rented premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;

B. Award damages in the amount of $320 for losses suffered by Plaintiff;

C. Order Defendant to repair the broken lock on the main entry door and take necessary measures to ensure the security of the premises;

D. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
