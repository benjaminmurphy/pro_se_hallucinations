Bristol County Probate and Family Court
Complaint for Modification
Probate and Family Court Department
Docket No. 

Sara Mitchell
Plaintiff

v.

Kyle Thompson
Defendant

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, by and through undersigned counsel, and alleges the following for Complaint for Modification:

1. The Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. The Defendant, Kyle Thompson, is also a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. The parties were formerly married and are the parents of two minor children: Emma Thompson, born on [Date of Birth], and Liam Thompson, born on [Date of Birth].

2. On March 15, 2022, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court issued a custody order granting the parties joint legal custody, with the children primarily residing with Sara Mitchell and visiting Kyle Thompson on alternating weekends.

3. Pursuant to the existing custody order, the parties are required to support the children's relationship with each parent and not disparage one another in the presence of the children.

4. Since the issuance of the existing custody order, the Defendant, Kyle Thompson, has engaged in a pattern of behavior detrimental to the well-being of the children. Specifically, the Defendant unilaterally signs the children up for activities during Plaintiff's scheduled weekends without consultation, leading to conflicts and undue stress on the children. The Defendant has disparaged the Plaintiff in the presence of the children, referring to Plaintiff as "selfish" and implying that Plaintiff does not love the children. This behavior has caused emotional distress to the children, with one child exhibiting physical symptoms such as stomach aches on transition days.

5. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, in the best interest of the children. The modification is necessary to protect the children from ongoing emotional harm resulting from the Defendant's conduct and to ensure a stable and consistent environment for their well-being.

Wherefore, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell.
2. Establish clear guidelines for scheduling decisions and communication between the parties to minimize conflicts and promote the best interest of the children.

Dated: December 1, 2025
