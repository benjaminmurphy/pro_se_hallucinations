Jessica Connors
Plaintiff

v.

Lynn Apartment Management
Defendant

Case No: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Connors, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Connors is an individual residing at [Your Address], Lynn, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Lynn Apartment Management is a property management company located at [Defendant's Address], Lynn, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21, as the damages sought herein do not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court as the events giving rise to the claims occurred at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business within this judicial district.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about October 5, 2023, at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, MA 01905, Defendant Lynn Apartment Management was responsible for maintaining smoke detectors in the common hallways of the apartment building where Plaintiff resided.

6. For months prior to the incident, a smoke detector located in the common hallway outside Plaintiff's unit was chirping due to a low battery. Despite Plaintiff's repeated complaints to the Defendant, no action was taken to remedy the issue, leading an unknown person to remove the battery altogether.

7. On the aforementioned date, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment, resulting in smoke filling the common hallway. Due to the inoperable smoke detector, Plaintiff did not receive any early warning of the fire.

8. As a result, Plaintiff only became aware of the fire when she smelled smoke, by which time the hallway was engulfed in thick smoke. Plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation while attempting to evacuate the building and was subsequently hospitalized.

9. Plaintiff incurred approximately $12,000 in medical expenses due to the smoke inhalation and lost approximately $2,500 in wages as a direct result of the Defendant's negligence.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. The Defendant Lynn Apartment Management owed a duty of care to maintain operative smoke detectors in the common areas of the apartment building in accordance with Massachusetts law.

11. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to adequately address the non-functioning smoke detector despite being notified of the issue multiple times, leading to Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

12. The Defendant's negligence directly and proximately caused the injuries and damages sustained by the Plaintiff.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Connors respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against the Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, and grant the following relief:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $14,500;
b. Costs and disbursements incurred in prosecuting this action; and
c. Any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
