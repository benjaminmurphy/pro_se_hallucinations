Jessica Miller
Plaintiff

v.

Thomas Landis
Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Miller, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas Landis, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.
2. Defendant Thomas Landis ("Defendant") is the landlord of the aforementioned property where Plaintiff resides.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action as the events giving rise to the claim occurred within its geographical jurisdiction.
5. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court as the subject property is located within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.
7. Beginning two months ago, Defendant initiated a renovation of the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's residence.
8. Due to the ongoing construction, Plaintiff has been subjected to continuous disturbances during normal business hours, including drilling, hammering, loud conversations, and the intrusion of dust into her living space.
9. These disruptions have significantly impeded Plaintiff's ability to work from home and have caused her undue stress and inconvenience.
10. Despite Defendant's prior notice of the renovation, the extensive duration and nature of the disturbances have violated Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of her rented premises under Massachusetts law.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment: Defendant's actions have breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment inherent in every residential lease under Massachusetts law.
12. As a result of Defendant's breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of $2000, being the difference between the value of the promised quiet enjoyment and the actual interference endured.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Miller respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Landis as follows:
a. Award damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $2000;
b. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper; and
c. Award Plaintiff the costs and expenses of this action, including reasonable attorney's fees.

Respectfully submitted,
