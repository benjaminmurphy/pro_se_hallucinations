v.
   
Sarah Thompson
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Miller, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Sarah Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. Defendant Sarah Thompson is the landlord of the aforementioned rental property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21.

4. Venue is proper in Lowell District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

6. Plaintiff has been paying rent in the amount of $1200 per month to Defendant.

7. On an unspecified date after the commencement of the lease, Plaintiff discovered the presence of mold in the bathroom of the rental unit.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold issue.

9. Defendant inspected the mold and wrongly attributed the cause of its growth to Plaintiff’s alleged failure to run the exhaust fan adequately and the temperature of Plaintiff's showers.

10. Plaintiff denies the allegations of causing the mold growth and asserts that the lack of proper ventilation in the bathroom contributed to the mold formation.

11. Plaintiff has suffered health issues, including respiratory problems, attributed to the mold exposure in the rental unit.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests the following relief:

b. Injunctive relief requiring Defendant to remediate the mold and provide adequate ventilation in the bathroom.
