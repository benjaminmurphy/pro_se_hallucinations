v.

Mark Thompson
456 Oak St
Chelsea, MA 02150
Defendant

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Brown, and files this Complaint against Defendant, Mark Thompson, as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Brown is an individual residing at 123 Main St, Chelsea, MA 02150.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the landlord of the property located at 123 Main St, Chelsea, MA 02150.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, specifically M.G.L. c. 186, § 18, which guarantees a tenant the right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Chelsea District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on June 1, 2022, for the premises located at 123 Main St, Chelsea, MA 02150.

6. On multiple occasions starting approximately two months ago, Plaintiff informed Defendant of a broken lock on the main entry door to the building, which poses a security risk as it does not properly latch, allowing unauthorized access to the building.

7. Despite Plaintiff's repeated reminders and requests for repair, Defendant has neglected to address the broken lock issue, thereby breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease agreement.

8. As a direct result of Defendant's failure to rectify the broken lock, unknown individuals gained unauthorized access to the building, leading to theft from the common areas, including Plaintiff's package valued at $120.

9. Additionally, Plaintiff has discovered evidence of unauthorized individuals occupying the basement of the building, causing Plaintiff distress and further violating her right to quiet enjoyment.

10. In response to the security concerns created by Defendant's inaction, Plaintiff incurred expenses of approximately $200 to purchase a security camera and a better deadbolt for her own door.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. Plaintiff asserts a single cause of action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts law, as codified in M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, citing Defendant's failure to maintain basic security measures on the leased premises, resulting in the infringement of Plaintiff's right to peaceable possession and enjoyment of the property.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

1. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff for damages in the amount of $320.

2. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
