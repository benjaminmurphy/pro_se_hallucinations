Jessica Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Thompson
Defendant

Complaint for Modification of Custody Order

I. Introduction

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, brings this Complaint for Modification seeking a change in the current custody arrangement with the Defendant, Michael Thompson, concerning their children, Emma Thompson (10) and Noah Thompson (8), pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28.

II. Factual Allegations

2. On May 10, 2022, this Honorable Court entered a custody order granting the parties shared legal custody of the children. The current arrangement specified that the children primarily reside with the Plaintiff and visit the Defendant on a regular schedule.

3. Over the past year, the Defendant has acted in ways that have had a detrimental impact on the children and the Plaintiff's parent-child relationship. Specifically, the Defendant has unilaterally signed the children up for activities scheduled during the Plaintiff's custodial time without prior discussion, causing conflicts and disruptions.

4. Furthermore, the Defendant has engaged in a pattern of alienating behaviors, including making derogatory remarks about the Plaintiff in front of the children. The children have reported instances where the Defendant has referred to the Plaintiff as "selfish" and suggested that the Plaintiff does not love them when seeking to modify visitation schedules.

5. As a result of the Defendant's behavior, one of the children, Noah, has begun experiencing physical symptoms, such as stomach aches, on transition days, indicating emotional distress caused by the current custody arrangement.

III. Requested Relief

6. The Plaintiff requests a modification of the existing custody order to establish her as the primary residential parent of the children, Emma and Noah, with the Defendant having limited and supervised visitation rights. The Plaintiff seeks to provide a stable and nurturing environment for the children, free from the detrimental effects of the Defendant's alienating behaviors.

IV. Legal Grounds

7. Pursuant to Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances which warrants such modification. In the present case, the Defendant's conduct constitutes a material change that adversely affects the best interests of the children and necessitates a revision of the current custody arrangement.

V. Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff primary residential custody of the children, Emma and Noah;
2. Order supervised visitation for the Defendant;
3. Award such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
