Plaintiff  
  
v.  
  
Mark Davis  
[His Address]  
Defendant  
  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
  
Now comes the Plaintiff, Lisa Montgomery, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Davis, alleges as follows:  
  
1. The parties are the parents of Emma (8) and Noah (6), with the original custody order entered on May 15, 2020, granting primary custody to Lisa Montgomery and providing Mark Davis with visitation rights on alternate weekends and one overnight during the week.  
    
2. A material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody order, specifically, Mark Davis's new job working night shifts from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week which significantly affects his ability to properly care for the children during his designated parenting time. Mark Davis has been unable to fulfill his parenting responsibilities by leaving the children with limited supervision, including instances where the children have fallen asleep unsupervised while Mark Davis naps after his shift.  
  
3. The children's well-being is at risk and their best interests are compromised by the current custody arrangement due to Mark Davis's work schedule impeding his capacity to exercise proper care and supervision during his parenting time.  
  
4. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody order to ensure that the children's overnights with Mark Davis occur only on nights he is off work and able to provide adequate attention and care to them.  
  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court grant a modification of the existing custody order in the best interests of the children, Emma and Noah, and for such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
