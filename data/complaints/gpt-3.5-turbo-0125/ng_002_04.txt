Case No.: [to be filled by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Stevens, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing at [Plaintiff's address], Newton, Massachusetts 02467.

2. The Defendant, Mark Stevens, is believed to be an individual residing at [Defendant's address], Newton, Massachusetts 02467.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action seeks damages for personal injuries arising from a negligent act of the Defendant. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limit of this Court.

4. The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred on September 15, 2023, at Hammond Pond Parkway, Newton, Massachusetts 02467.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On the aforementioned date, while jogging on the path at Hammond Pond Parkway in Newton, the Plaintiff was suddenly approached by a large dog, owned by the Defendant, which was off-leash in violation of park regulations mandating all dogs to be leashed.

6. The Defendant, Mark Stevens, was present at the scene, holding the leash of his dog over his shoulder but failing to restrain the dog properly.

7. The dog charged at the Plaintiff, barking loudly, causing the Plaintiff to fear for her safety. In an attempt to avoid being bitten, the Plaintiff swerved off the path, tripped over a tree root, and fell down a small embankment, resulting in a fractured wrist.

8. Despite numerous witnesses, the Defendant failed to intervene promptly, only calling the dog back after the Plaintiff had already sustained injuries.

9. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant's negligence in failing to restrain his dog, the Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical expenses of approximately $4,500, lost $1,200 in wages due to the injury, and experienced significant pain and suffering.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. The Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff to maintain control of his dog and prevent it from causing harm to others while in a public park.

11. The Defendant breached this duty by permitting his dog to be off-leash and failing to prevent the dog from charging at the Plaintiff, leading to her injuries.

12. The Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff's fractured wrist and resulting damages.

13. The Defendant's negligence constitutes a violation of Massachusetts common law and statutory duties, including but not limited to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, § 155 and common law negligence principles.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in her favor and against the Defendant, Mark Stevens, for the following relief:

a. Compensatory damages for medical expenses in the amount of $4,500 and lost wages in the amount of $1,200;
b. Punitive damages to deter the Defendant and others from engaging in similar negligent conduct;
c. Pre-judgment interest as allowed by law;
