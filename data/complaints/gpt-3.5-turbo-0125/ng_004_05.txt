FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On February 15, 2023, at the location of 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603, the Defendant, Sarah Thompson, had a duty to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition for pedestrians.

6. Following a snowstorm, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply salt or sand to prevent the formation of ice.

7. Over the ensuing days, the path of cleared snow developed into a hazardous sheet of ice due to melting during the daytime and refreezing at night.

8. On the aforementioned date, Plaintiff was delivering groceries to a tenant of the apartment building when she slipped on the ice patch that had formed on the sidewalk.

10. The tenants had informed the Defendant of the hazardous conditions by sending photographs and notifying her of the danger, to which the Defendant callously responded, "the sun will take care of it."

11. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $3,500 in medical expenses and suffered a loss of approximately $800 in wages due to the defendant's negligence.

CAUSES OF ACTION

12. Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition for pedestrians.

13. Defendant breached the duty of care by failing to properly clear and treat the icy sidewalk, leading to hazardous conditions.

14. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries.

15. Plaintiff brings this action against the Defendant for negligence under Massachusetts common law.
