The court\u2019s analysis focuses on what \u201ccause shown\u201d means (i.e., a best-interests standard) when a joint custodian seeks to relocate, not on what constitutes a \u201cmaterial change in circumstances\u201d warranting modification of custody. Although the opinion quotes ALI Principles mentioning relocation as a substantial change, Mason itself does not adopt or apply a \u2018material change in circumstances\u2019 test or framework for custody modification; its holding is about the substantive best-interests standard for removal with joint custody, not about establishing or defining a threshold material change requirement.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.17 (2002)\u2026 state in pertinent part:\n\u2018(1) The relocation of a parent constitutes a substantial change in circumstances\u2026 only when the relocation significantly impairs either parent\u2019s ability to exercise responsibilities the parent has been exercising or attempting to exercise [under the judgement of divorce]\u2026\u2019\n\u2026 ALI Principles\u2026 support the view that where \u2018neither parent has been exercising a clear majority of custodial responsibility,\u2019 the effect of the relocation on the child is a \u2018relevant factor[]\u2019 in determining the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d"

The decision focuses on confrontation rights, admissibility of expert and hearsay evidence, voluntariness of statements, and related criminal procedure issues. It does not address child custody, parental cooperation, or communication between parents, so it cannot support a proposition about the importance of parental cooperation and communication in custody cases.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We conclude that the testimony concerning the factual contents of the autopsy report prepared by a nontestifying medical examiner violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation, see Crawford v.

Gonsalves, 445 Mass. 1, 5-10 (2005), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006), and that in the circumstances of this case the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder."

He also argues that the prosecutor vouched for the veracity of a Commonwealth witness in closing argument...\""

The court analyzes administrative rules on transfers of assets and the presumption that family-provided services are gratuitous, not child custody or the impact of parental actions on a child\u2019s well-being. It therefore does not address or establish any principle about custody proceedings or parental conduct affecting a child, so it does not support the stated proposition.",

We conclude that valid agency rules reasonably were applied to deny the deduction, and eligibility for assistance properly was determined.\u201d"
