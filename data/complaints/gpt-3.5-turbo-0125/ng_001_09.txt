2. Defendant Fresh Market Grocery is a business entity doing business at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this court.

4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court as the incident giving rise to this action occurred at the premises located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, MA 02143, which fall within the jurisdiction of this court.

6. While in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk, which was substantial enough to obscure the floor's surface and had cart tracks going through it.

7. Despite the visible spill, there were no "wet floor" signs or cones warning of the hazard.

8. An employee of Fresh Market Grocery was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away from the spill. The employee acknowledged that he had noticed the spill "a few minutes ago" but delayed addressing it until he finished his current task.
