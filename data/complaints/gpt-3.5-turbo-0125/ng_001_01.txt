Defendant

Civil Action No. 25-12345

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and files this complaint against the Defendant, Grocer's Market Inc., and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip].

2. Defendant, Grocer's Market Inc., is a corporation conducting business at 123 Dairy Ave, Somerville, MA 02144.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the County of Somerville as the cause of action arose within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 16, 2023, Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, was shopping at Grocer's Market Inc. located at 123 Dairy Ave, Somerville, MA 02144.

6. While in the dairy aisle of the store, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk, causing her to slip and fall on the floor.

7. The spilled milk puddle was of a significant size as evidenced by visible cart tracks passing through it. However, no warning signs or cones indicating a wet floor hazard were present.

8. An employee of Grocer's Market Inc. was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away from the spilled milk puddle. The employee acknowledged noticing the spill "a few minutes ago" but delayed cleaning it up until finishing his current task.

9. Despite the fall, Plaintiff completed her shopping but experienced increasing hip pain later that day. Subsequently, she sought medical treatment at urgent care and was diagnosed with a hip sprain requiring physical therapy.

10. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses due to the injury, and lost approximately $1,800 in wages as a result of missed work shifts.

CAUSES OF ACTION - NEGLIGENCE

11. Defendant owed a duty to maintain its premises in a safe condition for customers and adequately warn of known hazards per Massachusetts common law and statutes, including but not limited to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A, § 2, and ch. 231, § 85.

12. Defendant breached its duty by failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk, failing to place warning signs around the hazardous area, and failing to protect Plaintiff from known dangers on the premises.

13. Defendant's negligence in the maintenance of its premises directly resulted in Plaintiff's slip and fall incident, leading to her sustained injuries, medical expenses, and wage loss.
