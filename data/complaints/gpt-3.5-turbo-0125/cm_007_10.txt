Norfolk County Probate and Family Court  
Sarah Mitchell  
Plaintiff  

v.  

John Mitchell  
Defendant  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

I. INTRODUCTION  
1. Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, brings this action against Defendant, John Mitchell, seeking a modification of the existing custody order issued by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2019.

II. PARTIES  
2. Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].  
3. Defendant, John Mitchell, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which provides that the Probate and Family Court shall have jurisdiction over actions for modification of custody orders.  
5. Venue is proper in Norfolk County pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223, Section 3, as the minor child subject to the custody order resides in Norfolk County.

IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
6. On May 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting the parties 50/50 physical custody of their minor child, Emma Mitchell, on an alternating weekly basis.  
7. Recently, Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition. Their condition has deteriorated to the point where they have experienced multiple falls, rendering them unable to provide the necessary care for Emma without assistance.  
8. Defendant's treating physician has advised that Defendant should not be left alone with Emma in situations requiring quick physical responses due to safety concerns.  
9. Despite these medical recommendations, Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the 50/50 custody arrangement and often relies on Emma, who is twelve years old, to assist in their daily activities.  
10. Plaintiff is concerned for Emma’s well-being and safety under the current custody arrangement, as the level of care and supervision provided by Defendant is no longer adequate or safe for Emma.  
11. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody arrangement to ensure that Emma is primarily in Plaintiff’s care while allowing Defendant to have parenting time that aligns with their current physical limitations.

V. REQUESTED RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
- Modify the existing custody order to grant Plaintiff primary physical custody of Emma, with appropriate visitation rights for Defendant based on their physical condition;  
- Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

VI. SIGNATURE  
I hereby certify that the foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.  

Dated: December 1, 2025
