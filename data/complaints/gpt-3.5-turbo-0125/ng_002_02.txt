v.

Michael Thompson
Defendant

Civil Action No. ________

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is a resident of Newton, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is believed to be a resident of Newton, Massachusetts.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred at Highland Park, Newton, Massachusetts on May 15, 2023.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff was jogging in Highland Park, Newton, where a sign mandates that all dogs must be on leashes.

5. Defendant Michael Thompson, the owner of a large dog, knowingly allowed his unrestrained dog to run loose in the park.

6. Despite the obligation to leash his dog, Defendant Thompson was negligently inattentive and failed to keep the dog under control, thus breaching the duty of care owed to the Plaintiff.

7. As Plaintiff was jogging on the path, Defendant's unleashed dog aggressively charged at her, causing her reasonable fear of being bitten.

8. In an effort to escape the approaching dog, Plaintiff veered off the path and stumbled over a tree root, falling down a small embankment and fracturing her wrist.

9. The dog ceased its pursuit upon Plaintiff's fall, only after Defendant eventually called it back.

10. As a direct result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist requiring extensive medical treatment, incurred medical expenses of approximately $4,500, and suffered lost wages totaling approximately $1,200.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Plaintiff asserts a claim for negligence against Defendant based on his failure to leash his dog, resulting in injuries to Plaintiff.

12. Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain control of his dog in a public park where leashing is mandated, and breached that duty by allowing the dog to run unrestrained and causing harm to Plaintiff.

13. As a proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, medical expenses, and economic damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson requests the following relief from this Honorable Court:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $5,700, representing medical expenses and lost wages incurred as a result of the incident;
B. Any other damages deemed just and equitable by the Court;
C. Prejudgment interest on the compensatory damages awarded;
D. Costs and attorney's fees incurred in prosecuting this action; and
E. Such other relief as the court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
