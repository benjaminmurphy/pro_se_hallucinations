SUPERIOR COURT DEPARTMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT

CIVIL ACTION DOCKET NO.:

JORDAN HARRIS   
Plaintiff   

v.   

LINDA SMITH  
Defendant    

COMPLAINT   

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jordan Harris, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jordan Harris, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. The Defendant, Linda Smith, is the landlord of the subject premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and falls within the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court, as the subject premises is located within the jurisdiction of said Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on March 1, 2022, for the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, at a monthly rent of $1,200.

6. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to unforeseen medical expenses. Plaintiff paid the rent in full with the applicable late fee.

7. In November 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of water seepage issues in the basement unit, with water entering through the basement wall during heavy rain. Defendant acknowledged the issue but failed to take timely action.

8. An inspection by city authorities in November 2025 revealed the water seepage issue, in addition to various code violations. The water damage resulted in approximately $400 worth of damage to Plaintiff's rug and bookshelf, which were located against the affected wall.

9. Plaintiff has incurred additional expenses due to the water issue, including increased electricity costs from running a dehumidifier constantly to address the moisture problem.

10. Defendant, in response to the inspection findings, has threatened not to renew Plaintiff's lease set to expire in March 2026, citing the late rent payment as the reason, despite the ongoing unresolved water damage issue.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

12. Defendant's failure to timely address and remediate the water seepage issue constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. This breach has resulted in property damage to Plaintiff's personal belongings, increased utility costs, and the threat of lease non-renewal.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor against Defendant as follows:

a. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $400 for property damage;
b. Award Plaintiff costs and attorney fees as allowed by law; and
c. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
