Rubin, 370 Mass. 857 [1976]; Hale v. Hale, supra at 815), and thus the central question in this case is how these \u2018best interests\u2019 are to be determined.\u201d"

It concerns enforcement of a separation agreement, allocation of support as alimony vs. child support, SSDI credit, and contempt; custody/visitation is mentioned only tangentially and without discussion of a \u2018best interests\u2019 standard. Thus, it does not provide authority for the claimed proposition.",

Such agreements may be enforced so long as they are fair and reasonable, regardless of the rules that might otherwise apply."
