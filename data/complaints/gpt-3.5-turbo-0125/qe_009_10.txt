FOR THE COUNTY OF HAMPDEN
[SPRINGFIELD DIVISION]

Jessica Hartman
Plaintiff

v.

Thomas Jenkins
Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Hartman, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105.

2. The Defendant, Thomas Jenkins, is the landlord of the property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

4. Venue is proper in this district where the subject property is situated.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on May 1, 2022, to rent an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105, for a monthly rent of $1600.

6. On or around [Exact Date], Plaintiff's bedroom in the above-mentioned apartment lost electricity due to faulty wiring, rendering the room uninhabitable and unusable.

7. Despite Plaintiff's repeated complaints to the Defendant, the electrical issue in the bedroom has remained unresolved for approximately six weeks.

8. Defendant sent an electrician who confirmed that the repairs required to fix the wiring in the bedroom would be extensive due to the building's old wiring system.

9. As a result of the uninhabitable bedroom, Plaintiff has been unable to use it for its intended purpose as a home office. She has incurred additional expenses amounting to approximately $15 per day for utilizing alternative workspaces at coffee shops and $150 per month for a coworking space membership.

10. The ongoing electrical issue has caused significant inconvenience and distress to Plaintiff, affecting her ability to work and disrupting her living arrangements by overcrowding the living room with office equipment.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Defendant's failure to promptly address and repair the electrical issues in Plaintiff's bedroom constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, implied in every residential lease agreement in Massachusetts.

12. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, provides that landlords must maintain premises in a habitable condition, including providing functional electrical systems.

13. The case law supports that a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when a landlord fails to address habitability issues promptly, thereby depriving the tenant of the full use and enjoyment of the premises. (cite ten relevant cases here)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Declare that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law;
b. Order Defendant to repair the electrical wiring in Plaintiff's bedroom within a reasonable time frame;
c. Award damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $450 for additional expenses incurred and the diminished value of the lease;
d. Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]

Jessica Hartman, Plaintiff
