While the excerpt focuses on State Sanitary Code violations generally, not mold specifically, it supports the broader proposition that failure to maintain habitable conditions in violation of the Code breaches an implied warranty of habitability under Massachusetts law. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is not discussed in this excerpt, so support is only clear as to the implied warranty of habitability, not quiet enjoyment.",
