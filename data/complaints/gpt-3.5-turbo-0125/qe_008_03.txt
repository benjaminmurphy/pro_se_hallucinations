IN THE DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE COUNTY OF CHELSEA
[District Court Address]

Jessica Harris
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Thompson
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Harris ("Plaintiff"), for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant"), states the following:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harris is an individual residing at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, MA 02150.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the landlord of the property located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, MA 02150.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19.

4. Venue is proper in the Chelsea District Court as the subject property is located within the jurisdiction of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, MA 02150.

6. Since then, the main entry door to the building in which Plaintiff's apartment is located has had a broken lock, which does not latch properly, making it easy for unauthorized individuals to enter the building without permission.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the broken lock approximately two months ago but despite assurances to fix it, Defendant has failed to take any action to remedy the situation.

8. As a result of the broken lock, on a date in November 2025, an unauthorized individual gained access to the building, entered the hallway, and stole packages belonging to Plaintiff and other tenants, causing Plaintiff a loss of approximately $120.

9. Additionally, Plaintiff has discovered evidence that an unauthorized individual has been sleeping in the basement of the building, creating a significant security risk and causing Plaintiff distress and concern for her safety.

10. In response to Defendant's inaction, Plaintiff incurred expenses of approximately $200 to purchase a security camera for her door and a better deadbolt, in order to ensure her safety and security.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. Defendant's failure to repair the broken lock on the main entry door constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease agreement under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;
b. Award damages in the amount of $320 plus any additional amounts as deemed just and proper by the Court;
c. Order Defendant to promptly repair the broken lock on the main entry door to ensure the safety and security of Plaintiff and other tenants; and
d. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]

Jessica Harris, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025
