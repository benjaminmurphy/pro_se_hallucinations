Plaintiff,  

v.  

Lynn Apartment Management, Inc.  
123 Maple St  
Lynn, MA 01901  

Defendant.  

COMPLAINT  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, David Martinez, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, Inc., alleges as follows:

PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, David Martinez, is an individual residing at [Your Address], Lynn, MA 01901.

2. The Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, Inc., is a corporation that owns and operates the apartment building located at 123 Maple St, Lynn, MA 01901.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff due to the negligence of the Defendant. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the Lynn District Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Maple St, Lynn, MA 01901.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 

5. On or about July 15, 2023, at the apartment building owned by the Defendant, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment due to kitchen-related issues, leading to smoke filling the common hallways.

6. Despite the duty to maintain operational smoke detectors in the common areas, the smoke detector outside the Plaintiff's unit had a low battery, causing it to chirp. After the chirping became unbearable, an unknown individual removed the battery, rendering the smoke detector inoperative.

7. The Plaintiff promptly notified the Defendant on multiple occasions about the malfunctioning smoke detector but the Defendant failed to take appropriate and timely action to rectify the situation.

8. As a result of the inoperative smoke detector, the Plaintiff was not warned of the fire until the smoke had already engulfed the hallway, causing the Plaintiff to suffer smoke inhalation and difficulty breathing while attempting to vacate the premises.

CAUSES OF ACTION  

9. The Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff to maintain functional smoke detectors in the common areas of the apartment building to ensure the safety of all residents.

10. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly address the malfunctioning smoke detector, despite being made aware of the issue multiple times.

11. The Defendant's negligence in failing to maintain the smoke detector directly caused the Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, David Martinez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Award compensatory damages in the amount of $9,500, representing medical expenses of $7,000 and lost wages of $2,500.

b. Award any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
