Kevin Thompson

Cambridge, MA 02139

Plaintiff,

v.

Lydia Grant
[Landlord's Address]
Cambridge, MA [Landlord's Zip Code]

Defendant.

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Kevin Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant Lydia Grant ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Kevin Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

2. Defendant Lydia Grant is the landlord of the property located at [Property Address], Cambridge, MA [Landlord's Zip Code].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21. Venue is proper in Cambridge District Court as the property subject to this action is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

5. Defendant initiated a renovation of the neighboring unit to Plaintiff's residence approximately two months ago. The renovation has resulted in continuous construction noise including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations of workers between the hours of 8 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.

6. The disruptive noise from the ongoing renovation has made it difficult for Plaintiff, who works from home, to focus on work calls and has interfered with his quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

7. Plaintiff has experienced dust entering his unit through the vents due to the renovation work next door, further contributing to the discomfort and inconvenience caused by Defendant's actions.

8. While Defendant informed Plaintiff of the renovation project before its commencement and the workers maintain reasonable working hours, the prolonged disturbance from the construction activities has significantly impacted Plaintiff's living conditions and disrupted his ability to work effectively from home.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as recognized under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Kevin Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and grant the following relief:

1. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law;
2. Damages in the amount of approximately $1500 for the disruption caused by Defendant's actions;
3. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
