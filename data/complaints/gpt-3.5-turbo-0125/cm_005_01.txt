Bristol County Probate and Family Court
Complaint for Modification
Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff
v.
Michael Brown, Defendant
Docket No. XXX-XXXX-XXXX

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Brown, states as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].
1.2. The Defendant, Michael Brown, resides at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].
1.3. The parties are the parents of two children: Emily Thompson, aged 10, and Noah Thompson, aged 8.

2. Jurisdiction
2.1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 209C, § 10, as the Probate and Family Court where the original custody order was entered on April 12, 2022.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1. Pursuant to the existing custody order dated April 12, 2022, the parties share joint legal custody, with primary physical custody awarded to the Plaintiff.
3.2. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly undermined the Plaintiff's custodial rights by unilaterally enrolling the children in activities that conflict with the Plaintiff's scheduled weekends without prior discussion or agreement.
3.3. The Defendant has engaged in a pattern of alienating behavior towards the Plaintiff, including making disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff to the children, such as calling the Plaintiff "selfish" and implying that the Plaintiff does not love the children.
3.4. Such alienating behavior has caused emotional distress to the children, as evidenced by one of the children experiencing physical symptoms such as stomach aches on transition days.

4. Legal Basis
4.1. Modification of a custody order is warranted when there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the children. See Blixt v. Blixt, 438 Mass. 364 (2003).
4.2. The Defendant's persistent interference with the Plaintiff's custodial rights constitutes a material change in circumstances justifying a modification of the existing custody order. See Pare v. Pare, 409 Mass. 292 (1991).
4.3. Massachusetts law requires that custody decisions be made based on the best interests of the children. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 208, § 31.
4.4. The children's emotional well-being and stability are paramount in custody determinations. See Ross v. Ross, 385 Mass. 30 (1982).

5. Requested Relief
5.1. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the children to the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, with appropriate visitation rights for the Defendant, Michael Brown.
5.2. The Plaintiff also requests that the Court impose clear guidelines and restrictions on scheduling decisions to prevent further unilateral actions by the Defendant.
5.3. The Plaintiff further requests any other relief that the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests that this Court enter an order modifying the existing custody arrangement in accordance with the above-stated requests.

Respectfully submitted,
