Michael Davis,
Defendant

Docket No.: [Insert Docket Number]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Davis, alleges as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
1.2. The Defendant, Michael Davis, is a resident of [New Hampshire address].
1.3. The minor child subject to this action is Sophie Davis, born on [DOB], currently aged 8.

2. Background
2.1. On March 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order granting primary custody of Sophie to Jessica Taylor, with visitation rights for Michael Davis on Wednesdays and alternating weekends.
2.2. The custody arrangement was established based on the proximity of the parties in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where both parents resided at the time and Sophie attended school.

3. Material Change in Circumstances
3.1. Subsequent to the entry of the custody order, the Defendant has expressed an intent to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity.
3.2. The proposed relocation would create significant challenges for the minor child, Sophie, as it would necessitate long drives of approximately ninety minutes or more each way for midweek overnights spent with the Defendant, followed by early morning returns to ensure attendance at school the next day.
3.3. Sophie has already begun to experience anxiety due to the extensive travel required and the impact on her after-school activities and routines.

4. Requested Modification
4.1. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnights with the Defendant, Michael Davis.
4.2. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks an adjustment to the weekend visitation schedule to accommodate the increased distance between the parties' residences in a manner that is in the best interests of the minor child, Sophie.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:
1. Modification of the current custody order to remove midweek overnights with the Defendant;
2. Adjustment of the weekend visitation schedule to reflect the parties' new circumstances and the best interests of the minor child, Sophie; and
3. Such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
