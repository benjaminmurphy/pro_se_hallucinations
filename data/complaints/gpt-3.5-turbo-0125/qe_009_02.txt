IN THE HAMPDEN SUPERIOR COURT
FOR THE COUNTY OF HAMPDEN

Emily Johnson,
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Thompson,
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the landlord of the subject premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 185C, § 16 and ch. 218, § 19.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant on May 1, 2021, concerning the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

5. Since approximately October 20, 2025, one of the bedrooms in Plaintiff's apartment has been without electricity due to faulty wiring specifically affecting that room, rendering it uninhabitable.

6. Despite being made aware of the electrical issue, Defendant has failed to promptly and adequately address the problem, forcing Plaintiff to refrain from using the affected room since electricity is essential for lighting and operating electronic devices.

7. An electrician inspected the premises at Defendant's request and indicated that substantial repairs are required to remedy the electrical issues in the affected room, which have not been performed to date.

8. Plaintiff has incurred additional expenses as a result of being unable to utilize the room, including daily expenditures at coffee shops for work purposes, costing approximately $15 per day, and a coworking space membership at $150 per month.

9. The inability to use the bedroom has caused Plaintiff to cram her office materials into the living room, disrupting the living conditions in the apartment and severely impacting her quality of life.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

10. Plaintiff reiterates and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

11. Defendant's failure to promptly address the electrical issues in the affected bedroom constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 186, § 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

a. Awarding damages in the amount of $1,200 plus costs and attorney's fees;
b. Granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
