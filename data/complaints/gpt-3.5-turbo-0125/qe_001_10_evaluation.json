While this excerpt is a concurrence/dissent and not the majority, it squarely discusses G.L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A, tenants\u2019 use of sanitary code violations as a defense to nonpayment, and the interdependence of rent and habitability obligations\u2014core issues relevant to a complaint relying on habitability and \u00a7 8A. Thus, Hemingway is an appropriate supporting authority, even though this passage is not the binding holding itself.",

[c. 239, \u00a7 8A] and that therefore the plaintiff cannot recover.\u2019 As to each tenant the trial judge found that she had failed to give the written notice required by \u00a7 8A... He then properly ruled that \u00a7 8A \u2018is not available to the defendant as a defense to this proceeding.\u2019 ... Having thus failed to qualify for the defence which would otherwise have been available to them under \u00a7 8A, the tenants ask this court to give them relief by holding (a) that the landlord impliedly warranted the fitness of their apartments for habitation...\""

Hemingway and Simon v. Solomon. Simon v. Solomon squarely addresses and applies G.L. c. 186, \u00a714, discusses its relationship to other tenant-remedy statutes including c. 239, \u00a78A, and builds on Hemingway\u2019s warranty-of-habitability framework.

L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 127A-127L, c. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15E, 15F, 18, 19; c. 239, \u00a7 8A. These statutes are designed to facilitate enforcement of State housing regulations and to provide relief for tenants deprived of decent homes. See Boston Hous. Auth. v.
