IN THE SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX

Jessica Turner
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Lawson
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Lawson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 12 Elm St, Apt 2, Somerville, MA 02144.
2. Defendant Mark Lawson is the landlord of the apartment leased by Plaintiff at the aforementioned address.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19.
4. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court as the lease in question was executed and is to be performed within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on January 15, 2022, for the rental of Apartment 2 at 12 Elm St, Somerville, MA.
6. Defendant, in his capacity as landlord, breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease agreement by failing to take action to abate the excessive noise caused by the upstairs tenants.
7. Since the occupancy of the tenants on the floor above, Plaintiff has endured continuous disturbances, including loud stomping, late-night music playing, and disruptive furniture moving, which has significantly affected Plaintiff's ability to enjoy the premises and maintain a reasonable standard of comfort and privacy.
8. Despite numerous complaints made by Plaintiff to Defendant about the noise issues, Defendant only addressed the matter superficially, stating that he cannot control the behavior of the tenants.
9. The persistent noise disturbances have not only caused Plaintiff severe sleep deprivation, resulting in negative consequences such as falling asleep at work and requiring costly sleep medication, but have also forced her to expend additional resources on various remedies to mitigate the disruption, all to no avail.
10. Plaintiff contends that she is entitled to seek relief for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as guaranteed under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

CAUSES OF ACTION

11. Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment - Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, and relevant case law, Defendant has breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to take reasonable steps to address and remedy the ongoing noise disturbances caused by other tenants.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

a. An award of $5000 in damages for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
b. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
c. Costs and attorney fees incurred in bringing this action.
d. Such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
