Jessica Turner,  
Plaintiff  


v.  


Michael Roberts,  
Defendant  


COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  


COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Turner, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Roberts, alleges as follows:  


PARTIES  


1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA.  
2. Defendant Michael Roberts is the landlord of the aforementioned property.


JURISDICTION AND VENUE  


3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws ch. 218, § 21.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, as the subject property is located in Dorchester.


FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  


5. On January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant to lease a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA.  
6. From the inception of the tenancy, Plaintiff has experienced repeated heating issues in the rental unit, specifically intermittent drops in temperature to approximately 60 degrees for extended periods of time.  
7. Despite Defendant's attempts to address the heating issue by sending repair professionals to the property on two occasions, the problem has persisted, causing Plaintiff to endure discomfort and incur additional expenses.  
8. Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain a livable temperature in the unit, resulting in a significant increase in the electricity bill amounting to approximately $150 per month.  
9. The inadequate heating conditions in the rental unit contributed to Plaintiff contracting bronchitis in January, which required missed workdays and medical expenses for antibiotics.  
10. Defendant maintains that the heating system is "functional" as it does not completely fail and the building temperature does not drop to freezing levels.  


CLAIM FOR RELIEF  


11. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs.  
12. Defendant's failure to provide adequate and consistent heating in the rental unit constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed under Massachusetts law.  
13. Such breach has caused Plaintiff to suffer discomfort, financial losses, and health issues, thereby entitling Plaintiff to compensatory damages.  


PRAYER FOR RELIEF  


WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  
a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $500.  
b. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  
c. All costs and fees associated with this action.  


Dated: December 1, 2025.
