Emily Johnson
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Smith
Defendant

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Smith, states as follows:

1. Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.
1.2. The Defendant, Mark Smith, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.
1.3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Sophia Smith, born on [Date of Birth].

2. Factual Allegations
2.1. On March 12, 2019, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered an Order establishing a 50/50 physical custody arrangement for the parties' minor child, Sophia Smith, with one week on and one week off schedule.
2.2. Subsequent to the entry of the original custody order, a material change in circumstances has occurred. The Defendant, Mark Smith, has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has significantly impacted his ability to care for the minor child safely and effectively.
2.3. The Defendant's condition has led to multiple falls at home, rendering him unable to be alone with the child in situations requiring quick physical response. Despite medical advice indicating limitations in caring for the child, the Defendant insists on maintaining the current 50/50 custody arrangement and at times requires the minor child to assist in tasks beyond her age-appropriate responsibilities, such as helping with mobility and care.
2.4. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the current custody arrangement to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child, Sophia Smith. It is in the best interests of the child that she primarily resides with the Plaintiff, with appropriate visitation for the Defendant.

3. Requested Modification
3.1. The Plaintiff requests the Court modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to her, with visitation rights to the Defendant as determined by the Court.
3.2. The proposed modification of custody is necessary to ensure the safety, stability, and well-being of the minor child, Sophia Smith, given the Defendant's health condition and the limitations it imposes on his ability to care for the child.
3.3. The Plaintiff respectfully asks the Court to consider the best interests of the child in granting the requested modification.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
1. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson.
2. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
