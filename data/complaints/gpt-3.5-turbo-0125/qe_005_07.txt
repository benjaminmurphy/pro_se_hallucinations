Plaintiff

v.

Robert Smith
[Landlord's Address]
Somerville, MA [Landlord's Zip Code]

Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Robert Smith, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144.

2. Defendant Robert Smith is the landlord of the property located at [Landlord's Address], Somerville, MA [Landlord's Zip Code].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19 and Chapter 185C, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to reside in an apartment at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144. The lease contains a covenant of quiet enjoyment.

6. Since around six months ago, the tenants residing above Plaintiff have continuously engaged in excessively loud activities, including stomping, playing loud music late at night, and moving furniture, causing a disturbance to Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the premises.

7. Despite Plaintiff's numerous complaints to Defendant about the noise disturbances, Defendant has failed to take adequate measures to address the issue, citing an inability to control the behavior of the upstairs tenants.

8. Plaintiff's lack of quiet enjoyment has significantly impacted her quality of life, leading to sleep deprivation resulting in negative consequences at work, a requirement for sleep medication costing $40 per month, and severe disruption to her daily activities.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Defendant's failure to take action to abate the noise disturbances by the upstairs tenants constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all leases under Massachusetts law.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests the following relief from this Court:

1. Damages in the amount of $1,200.

2. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Emily Johnson
