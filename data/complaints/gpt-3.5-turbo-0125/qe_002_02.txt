IN THE BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT, ROXBURY DIVISION

Jordan Lee
Plaintiff

v.

Martha Johnson
Defendant

Case No: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Lee, by and through the undersigned legal assistant, and files this Complaint against Defendant Martha Johnson, and in support thereof states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Lee, is an individual residing at 345 Walnut St, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. Defendant, Martha Johnson, is the landlord of the residential premises located at 345 Walnut St, Roxbury, MA 02119.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This court has jurisdiction over this matter as the claims alleged herein arise under the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about October 15, 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to unforeseen medical bills. Plaintiff subsequently paid the rent in full, including any applicable late fees.

6. In November 2025, Plaintiff discovered water seeping into the basement unit through the wall during heavy rainstorms. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water infiltration issue.

7. Despite Plaintiff's notification, Defendant failed to take adequate action to address the water intrusion matter, which led Plaintiff to contact the city authorities for inspection.

8. The city inspection revealed not only the water infiltration issue but also various code violations related to the property maintained by Defendant.

9. As a direct result of the water intrusion, Plaintiff's personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, sustained damages totaling approximately $400.

10. Plaintiff has been forced to use a dehumidifier continuously to address the water issue, leading to increased electricity expenses.

11. Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff by indicating an intent not to renew the lease, citing the late rent payment as justification, despite the timing appearing suspicious given the ongoing water problem.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases under Massachusetts law, specifically Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for damages in the amount of $400, plus any additional costs incurred by Plaintiff due to the water intrusion issue;

B. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper; and

C. Award Plaintiff the costs and attorney's fees incurred in pursuing this action.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
