Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant John Mitchell, alleges and states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at [Your Address], City of Newton, County of Middlesex, Massachusetts. 

2. Defendant John Mitchell is an individual who also resides in the City of Newton, County of Middlesex, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the City of Newton, County of Middlesex, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On September 15, 2023, at Greenough Park in Newton, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was jogging along the park path where there are posted signs requiring all dogs to be leashed.

5. Defendant, John Mitchell, with knowledge of the leash requirement, habitually allows his large dog to roam unleashed at the same park.

6. On the aforementioned date, Defendant's unleashed dog aggressively ran towards Plaintiff, barking loudly, causing Plaintiff to fear for her safety.

7. Despite being approximately thirty feet away, Defendant failed to control or restrain his dog by allowing the leash to remain unattached while engaging in conversation with friends.

8. In order to avoid the approaching unleashed dog, Plaintiff was forced to veer off the path and subsequently tripped over a tree root, falling down a small embankment and fracturing her wrist. Plaintiff also sustained additional bruises as a result of the fall.

9. Despite the dog stopping its advance upon Plaintiff's fall, Defendant did not promptly call back or contain the dog until Plaintiff was already injured.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. Plaintiff asserts a cause of action against the Defendant based on negligence, as follows:

11. The Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to control and restrain his dog in compliance with posted leash requirements.

12. The Defendant breached this duty by allowing his dog to roam freely, leading to the aggressive action that caused Plaintiff's injuries.

13. The Defendant's breach was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries, including a fractured wrist and additional bruises, resulting in medical expenses and lost wages as set forth herein.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests this Honorable Court to grant the following relief:

a. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for all damages sustained in an amount not less than $7,500, plus applicable interest;
