Emily Johnson, Petitioner

v.

Michael Smith, Respondent
_____________________________________________________

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Petitioner, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Respondent, Michael Smith, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Petitioner, Emily Johnson, is a resident of [City], [State].

2. The Respondent, Michael Smith, is a resident of [City], [State].

3. The minor child subject to this Complaint is Lucas Smith, an 8-year-old child born on [Date of Birth].

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On April 15, 2018, the Court issued an Order granting primary physical custody of Lucas Smith to the Petitioner, with the Respondent having three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnight visits permitted.

5. Since the issuance of the original custody Order, significant changes have occurred that warrant a modification of the custody arrangement. Specifically, the Respondent now resides in his own apartment where Lucas Smith has his own bedroom, enabling the accommodation of overnight visits for the child.

6. Lucas Smith is now 8 years old, attends school full-time, and has expressed a strong desire for overnight stays at his father's residence. The current custody arrangement, which involves frequent short visits during the week and minimal visitation time, has become disruptive to Lucas's school routine, extracurricular activities, and overall well-being.

7. Both the Petitioner and the Respondent acknowledge the necessity of modifying the custody arrangement to better serve Lucas's best interests as he has grown and his circumstances have evolved.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

8. The Petitioner respectfully requests a modification of the existing custody order to provide for overnight visitation with the Respondent at his residence.

9. The proposed modification seeks to amend the current custody arrangement to allow for alternating weekends and one weekday overnight visit per week, taking into consideration Lucas's school schedule and personal preferences.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

10. The Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grants the requested modification to the existing custody order in the best interests of the minor child, Lucas Smith.

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

1. Modify the existing custody order to permit overnight visitation with the Respondent at his residence.

2. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
