COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Maria Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant John Carter, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Maria Thompson, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

2. The Defendant, John Carter, is the landlord of the aforementioned property, located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 185C, Section 21, as the action arises from a landlord-tenant relationship within Worcester County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On June 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant for the rental of the property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

5. Since approximately September 1, 2025, the Plaintiff has repeatedly informed the Defendant of a severe rodent infestation in the rental unit, specifically in the kitchen, evidenced by the presence of mouse droppings.

6. The Plaintiff diligently raised concerns with the Defendant about the rodent infestation, to which the Defendant responded inadequately by placing a few traps in the kitchen.

7. Despite the Defendant's minimal efforts, the rodent infestation persisted, causing the Plaintiff significant emotional distress and financial hardship due to the constant presence of rodent droppings in her living space.

8. The Plaintiff reasonably requested the Defendant to address the rodent infestation comprehensively by engaging in effective pest control measures but the Defendant, citing the cost as prohibitive, neglected to take appropriate action.

9. As a result of the Defendant's failure to remedy the rodent infestation, the Plaintiff has incurred expenses totaling approximately $280 in discarded food items and purchased containers, in an attempt to mitigate the ongoing issue.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. The Defendant's failure to adequately address and remedy the rodent infestation in the rental unit constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to grant the following relief:

a. A judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant for damages in the amount of $280;
b. Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in this action; and
c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
