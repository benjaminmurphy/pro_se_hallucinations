IN THE BOSTON HOUSING COURT

Carla Martinez,
Plaintiff,

v.

James Sullivan,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Carla Martinez, and for her complaint against the Defendant, James Sullivan, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Carla Martinez, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. The Defendant, James Sullivan, is the landlord of the subject property located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships, including but not limited to the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Jurisdiction is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On February 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

5. During the viewing of the apartment, the Defendant assured the Plaintiff that a prior leak issue had been fully repaired.

6. Shortly after moving in, the Plaintiff discovered water stains on the ceiling of the apartment. The Defendant assured the Plaintiff that the issue had been rectified.

7. Subsequently, during rainstorms, water began to drip through the same spot on the ceiling, causing damage to the Plaintiff's personal property, including a couch and a laptop.

8. Despite repeated complaints to the Defendant, the water leakage issue has persisted, leading to a musty odor in the apartment and the Plaintiff experiencing health issues, including headaches that may be attributed to mold exposure.

CAUSE OF ACTION

9. The Defendant's failure to effectively address and remedy the water leakage issue constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as implied by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Declare that the Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Award damages to the Plaintiff in the amount of $1000 for property damage and personal inconvenience;
c. Grant any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Dated: December 1, 2025
