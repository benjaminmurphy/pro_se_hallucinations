v.

Mark Richards, Defendant

Docket No.: [To be Assigned]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins ("Jennifer"), and for her Complaint for Modification against Defendant Mark Richards ("Mark"), alleges and states as follows:

1. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1.1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, is a resident of Massachusetts, residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].
1.2. The Defendant, Mark Richards, is also a resident of Massachusetts, residing at [Mark's Address].
1.3. The parties are the parents of two minor children, Emily (8) and Jacob (6).
1.4. The original custody order between the parties was entered by this Court on May 15, 2021.
1.5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28.

2. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

2.1. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances warranting modification.
2.2. Specifically, subsequent to the entry of the original custody order, the Defendant has begun residing with an individual who possesses a criminal record for assault and battery and had a restraining order filed against them by a previous partner.
2.3. The presence of this individual in the Defendant's household has created a threatening and unsafe environment for the children. They have exhibited aggressive behavior toward the children, as evidenced by incidents where they yelled, slammed doors, and physically left a mark on one of the children's arms.
2.4. Moreover, a recent incident involving a neighbor's report to the police due to a loud argument in the Defendant's residence further substantiates the dangerous and tumultuous environment the children are being exposed to during visitations.

3. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

3.1. In light of the foregoing material change in circumstances and in the best interest of the children, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modifies the existing custody order to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor children.
3.2. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the Court amend the custody order to either prohibit the individual with the criminal record from being present during visitations with the children, or in the alternative, require that all visits with the Defendant be supervised to safeguard the children from exposure to harm.
3.3. The Plaintiff seeks such modification to protect the children from further physical and emotional harm while fostering a safe and stable environment for their growth and development.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order as requested above.

Respectfully submitted,
