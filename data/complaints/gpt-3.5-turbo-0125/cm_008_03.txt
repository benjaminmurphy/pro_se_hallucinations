Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes Laura Martinez, the Petitioner in the above-entitled action, and for her Complaint against Mark Johnson, the Respondent, alleges as follows:

1. The Petitioner, Laura Martinez, and the Respondent, Mark Johnson, are the parents of Sofia Johnson, a minor child born on [Date].

2. The original Judgment of Custody and Support was entered by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2022, establishing Laura as the primary residential parent with shared legal custody, and granting substantial weekend time with Mark, including Sunday nights.

3. The current custody arrangement requires the parties to cooperate on school-related matters concerning Sofia.

4. The Petitioner avers that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original judgment, specifically regarding the school attendance and academic performance of Sofia.

5. Over the past year, the Respondent has consistently kept Sofia home from school on Mondays after his weekends, without providing any medical justification. This has led to truancy warnings from the school and a decline in Sofia's academic performance.

6. Additionally, the Respondent frequently refuses to take Sofia to tutoring sessions scheduled during his weekends, further negatively impacting her education.

7. The Petitioner believes that these actions by the Respondent are not in the best interests of Sofia and are causing harm to her academic progress and overall well-being.

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to:

a. Grant the Petitioner final decision-making authority regarding school attendance decisions for Sofia; or 
b. Alternatively, reduce the overnight time awarded to the Respondent on school nights to ensure Sofia's attendance and participation in educational activities.

The Petitioner requests such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
