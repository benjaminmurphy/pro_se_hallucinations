2. Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC is a business entity engaged in the ownership and management of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, MA 01905.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the claims asserted herein exceed the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court as the actions giving rise to this Complaint occurred at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, MA 01905.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or around August 15, 2023, at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, MA 01905, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson resided on the third floor of the apartment building owned and managed by Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC.

6. Defendant had the duty to maintain functioning smoke detectors in the common hallways of the apartment building as required by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 148, Section 26F.

7. For months leading up to the incident, the smoke detector located outside Plaintiff's unit was chirping due to a low battery. Despite multiple complaints from Plaintiff to Defendant, the issue remained unresolved, leading to the removal of the battery.

8. On the night of August 15, 2023, a fire erupted in a first-floor apartment, causing smoke to fill the building. Due to the non-functioning smoke detector, Plaintiff did not receive timely warning of the fire and was exposed to smoke inhalation. Plaintiff suffered injuries and was hospitalized as a result.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC's negligent failure to properly maintain the smoke detectors in the common hallways of the apartment building directly caused harm to Plaintiff Jessica Thompson in violation of Massachusetts negligence law.
