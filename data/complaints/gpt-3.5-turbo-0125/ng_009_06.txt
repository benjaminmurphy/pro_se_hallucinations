COMPLAINT

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, [Your Name], is an individual residing at [Your Address], Lynn, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Franklin Properties, LLC, is a limited liability company doing business in Massachusetts and is the owner of the residential apartment building located at 23 Maple Street, Lynn, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On September 1, 2023, at 23 Maple Street, Lynn, MA, Defendant had a duty to maintain smoke detectors in the common hallways of the apartment building in compliance with Massachusetts Fire Code [M.G.L. c. 148, § 26F]. 

4. Despite Plaintiff's repeated notifications to Defendant that the smoke detector outside her unit was non-functional due to a low battery, Defendant failed to promptly address the issue and allowed the smoke detector to remain inoperable for an extended period.

5. On the night of September 1, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment at the building, triggering a smoke-filled environment in the common hallway due to the non-functional smoke detector.

6. As a result of the lack of warning from the non-functional smoke detector, Plaintiff was exposed to smoke inhalation and respiratory distress, requiring her to seek medical treatment at the hospital, incurring approximately $4,200 in medical expenses, and losing $1,500 in wages.

7. The failure of Defendant to maintain and repair the smoke detector in the common hallway directly resulted in the harm suffered by Plaintiff.

9. Defendant's breach of duty through its negligent failure to repair and maintain the smoke detector directly caused the injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiff.

10. The actions of Defendant constitute negligence under Massachusetts common law and statutory law, including M.G.L. c. 186, § 15B.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
