Civil Action No. ___________________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Alexandra Rivera, hereinafter referred to as "Plaintiff," and files this Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, hereinafter referred to as "Defendant," and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Alexandra Rivera is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14 and Chapter 186, Section 15B.

4. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 185C, Section 3 and Chapter 218, Section 19.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court as the subject property is located in Jamaica Plain, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On December 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

7. During the initial showing of the apartment, Plaintiff noticed water stains on the ceiling and inquired about them. Defendant assured Plaintiff that the stains were from a previous leak that had been completely resolved.

8. Subsequently, upon the first significant rainstorm, water began dripping through the ceiling in the same area of the water stains.

9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the ongoing water intrusion issues, with Defendant dismissively characterizing the problem as a "minor cosmetic issue."

10. Despite Plaintiff's repeated complaints, Defendant has failed to take appropriate action to address the water leaks, resulting in further damage to Plaintiff's personal property.

11. The leakage caused by Defendant's failure to remediate the issue has damaged Plaintiff's belongings, including soaking a couch and damaging a laptop, leading to replacement costs amounting to approximately $900.

12. The persistent water intrusion has also resulted in a musty smell in the apartment, suspected mold growth, and health concerns for Plaintiff, necessitating Plaintiff to reconfigure living space away from the affected area.

CAUSES OF ACTION

13. Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for actual damages in the amount of $1,200.

b. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and equitable.

c. Award costs and attorney's fees to Plaintiff.

d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

DATED: December 1, 2025
