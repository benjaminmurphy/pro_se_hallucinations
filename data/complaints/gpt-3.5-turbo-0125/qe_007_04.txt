COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her complaint against the Defendant, David Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

2. The Defendant, David Thompson, is the landlord of the aforementioned property located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, § 21.

4. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 1, 2021, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent an apartment at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

6. Since approximately September 1, 2025, the Defendant has engaged in extensive renovation activities in the unit adjacent to the Plaintiff's, resulting in constant construction noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers during weekdays from 8 AM to 5 PM.

7. The ongoing construction activities have significantly disrupted the Plaintiff's ability to work from home, causing disturbances during calls and impeding her concentration.

8. Additionally, dust and debris from the renovation work have infiltrated the Plaintiff's unit through the ventilation system.

9. While the Defendant provided advance notice of the renovation project and the workers have adhered to regular hours, the continuous disruptions have persisted for an unreasonable duration.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. The Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease under Massachusetts law, specifically under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14. The Defendant's disruptive conduct has substantially interfered with the Plaintiff's right to peacefully and quietly enjoy the leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

11. Award damages in the amount of $1000 to compensate the Plaintiff for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

12. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
