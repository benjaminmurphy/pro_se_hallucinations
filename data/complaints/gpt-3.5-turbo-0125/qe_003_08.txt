I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant, Mark Thompson, dated June 1, 2022, for the rental of a studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. During the showing of the rented premises, the Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling and inquired about them. The Defendant assured the Plaintiff that the stains were from a previous leak that had been completely remedied.

3. Shortly after moving in, the Plaintiff experienced water leakage through the same spot on the ceiling during a rainstorm, indicating that the issue had not been adequately resolved as promised by the Defendant.

4. Despite the Plaintiff's repeated complaints regarding the ongoing water leakage issue, the Defendant dismissively characterized it as a "minor cosmetic issue" and cited the apartment's purported "character" as justification for non-action.

5. The water leakage has progressively worsened, causing damage to the Plaintiff's personal property. Specifically, during a recent storm, the leaking water damaged the Plaintiff's couch and rendered a laptop on the coffee table useless, resulting in approximately $900 in damages.

6. The continued water leakage has created a persistent musty odor in the living space, leading the Plaintiff to believe that mold may be present, causing health concerns such as headaches.

7. The aforementioned conditions have significantly disrupted the Plaintiff's quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the leased premises, forcing adjustments in living arrangements and resulting in monetary damages and health-related issues.

II. CAUSE OF ACTION

BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

8. The Defendant's failure to timely and effectively address the recurring water leakage issue constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease agreement under Massachusetts law, specifically under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, ensuring tenants the right to peaceful habitation without interference.

III. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Declare that the Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

B. Award the Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $900 for property damage and health-related concerns.

C. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

D. Award the Plaintiff the costs of bringing this action and reasonable attorney's fees.

IV. JURY DEMAND

The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all triable issues.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
