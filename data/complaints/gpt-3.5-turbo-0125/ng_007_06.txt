IN THE DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BROCKTON DISTRICT

Lucas Johnson,     
Plaintiff

v.

Brockton Community Center,     
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Lucas Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lucas Johnson, is an individual residing at [Your Address], City of Brockton, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a community center located at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA 02301.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On September 15, 2023, at the premises of the Brockton Community Center, the Plaintiff's minor child was enrolled in an after-school program overseen by the Defendant.

4. The Defendant advertised that children in the program would be supervised at all times during recreational activities in the gym.

5. On said date, there were approximately twenty children present in the gym with only one staff member actively supervising while another staff member was absent due to office duties.

6. Despite reports of rough play and a dangerous tackle game involving older children, the remaining staff member negligently failed to intervene adequately, stating, "boys will be boys."

7. Consequently, the Plaintiff's eight-year-old child, being small for his age, was violently tackled by one of the older children, hitting his head on the hardwood floor, resulting in a concussion and rendering him unconscious for a brief period.

8. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant's negligent supervision of the children in its care, the Plaintiff's child suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, and incurred significant medical expenses.

CAUSES OF ACTION

9. The Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff's child to provide adequate supervision to prevent foreseeable harm during activities at the community center.

10. The Defendant breached its duty of care by negligently allowing unsupervised and dangerous activities to occur, resulting in the Plaintiff's child's injuries.

11. The Defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the Plaintiff's child's injuries and resulting damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, for:

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $5,000 for medical expenses incurred;
2. General damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience;
3. Prejudgment interest as allowed by law;
4. Costs and fees incurred in this action; and
5. Such further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
