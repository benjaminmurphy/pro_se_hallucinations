EMILY THOMPSON,
Plaintiff

v.

JORDAN SMITH,
Defendant

Civil Action No. _________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Jordan Smith, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Thompson, is an individual residing at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. The Defendant, Jordan Smith, is the landlord of the aforementioned premises.

3. The Plaintiff's phone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1433@gmail.com.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The appropriate court for this action is the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of a two-bedroom apartment at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124, commencing on January 1, 2022, at a monthly rent of $1500.

7. During the winter months, the apartment experienced recurring heating issues where the heat would drop to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit for extended periods, despite attempts by Defendant to address the problem through repairs.

8. Defendant sent repair personnel on two occasions, with the first repair attempt allegedly resolving the issue temporarily, but the problem persisted, necessitating a subsequent repair visit.

9. The second repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was old but functional and that further repairs would not significantly improve the heating situation.

10. As a result of the inadequate heating, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain a livable temperature, leading to an increase of approximately $150 per month in electricity costs.

11. The cold indoor air exacerbating by the heating issues contributed to Plaintiff contracting bronchitis in January, causing her to miss work and incur medical expenses for antibiotics.

12. Despite these ongoing problems, Defendant contends that the heating is functional because the apartment does not reach freezing temperatures.

CAUSES OF ACTION

13. Plaintiff alleges a cause of action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

14. Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14 provides that landlords must maintain premises in a fit and habitable condition, including providing adequate heating facilities.

15. Mendonca v. Clark, 2006 Mass. App. Div. 89, held that inadequate heating that affects the tenant's health constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a) Award damages in the amount of $600 for increased electric costs and medical expenses incurred due to Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

b) Grant any further relief as the Court deems just and proper;

c) Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including attorney's fees;

d) Grant any and all other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
