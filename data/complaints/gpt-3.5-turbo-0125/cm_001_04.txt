Plaintiff: Jessica Turner
v.
Defendant: Michael Turner
Docket No. [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby filing this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Turner, is also a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On May 15, 2020, this Honorable Court entered a custody order establishing a parenting schedule for the parties' children, Liam Turner (age 8) and Ava Turner (age 6).

4. Pursuant to the custody order, the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the children, while the Defendant exercises visitation rights every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

5. The Defendant recently commenced a new employment schedule that involves night shifts from 7 PM to 7 AM on several nights a week, undermining his ability to properly care for the children during his scheduled overnights.

6. Due to the Defendant's night shift work schedule, he has been frequently unable to care for the children during his allocated overnights, leading to him either leaving the children with his roommate or the children being left to fend for themselves as they fall asleep on the couch while the Defendant takes a nap.

7. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to ensure that the children's best interests are met by restricting overnights to times when the Defendant is available to provide proper care, rather than during his night shift work hours.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

8. The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order by restricting overnight visitation to times when the Defendant is not working night shifts. It is in the children's best interests to have parenting time with a parent who is fully available to provide proper care and supervision.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:
   a. Modify the existing custody order to limit overnight visitation based on the Defendant's work schedule.
   b. Grant such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]
Jessica Turner, Plaintiff
