Case No.: [to be assigned by the court]
Date of Original Order: May 15, 2021

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Reynolds, states as follows:

1. PARTIES: The Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, is a resident of [insert city], Massachusetts. The Defendant, Mark Reynolds, is also a resident of [insert city], Massachusetts.

2. CHILDREN: The parties have two children together: Emily Reynolds, born on [insert date], currently aged 10, and Jason Reynolds, born on [insert date], currently aged 8.

3. ORIGINAL ORDER: On May 15, 2021, a custody order was entered by this Honorable Court, granting primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, with the Defendant, Mark Reynolds, having alternate weekends and one midweek visitation.

4. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES: Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances. Specifically, the Defendant, Mark Reynolds, now lives with an individual who has a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order from a previous girlfriend. This person has exhibited aggressive behavior towards the children, as evidenced by incidents where they have yelled, slammed doors, and physically grabbed one of the children, leaving a mark on their arm. Additionally, the police were called to the residence during a loud argument in the presence of the children.

5. REQUESTED MODIFICATION: In light of the material change in circumstances and the safety concerns for the children, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to either prohibit the individual with the criminal record from being present during visitations with the children, or in the alternative, require that all visitations be supervised.

6. JURISDICTION: This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209, Section 38, which governs modifications of custody orders.

7. PRAYER FOR RELIEF: Wherefore, Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order in the best interests of the children, either by prohibiting the individual with the criminal record from contact with the children or by requiring supervised visitations.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]
