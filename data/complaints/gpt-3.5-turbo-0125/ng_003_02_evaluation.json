      "support_reasoning": "The opinion explicitly adopts a modern premises-liability standard for self-service retail operations, holding that store owners have a duty to take reasonable precautions commensurate with foreseeable risks created by their chosen mode of operation. While the facts involve grapes on a supermarket floor rather than unsecured shelf items, the court\u2019s reasoning is general: a self-service store must maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and foresee and guard against hazards inherent in how merchandise is displayed and accessed. This directly supports the broader proposition that a self-service retailer like HomeGoods owes customers a duty of care to maintain a safe shopping environment and to prevent foreseeable harms arising from how items are presented to customers.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Courts adopting this approach have concluded that where an owner\u2019s chosen mode of operation makes it reasonably foreseeable that a dangerous condition will occur, a store owner could be held liable for injuries to an invitee if the plaintiff proves that the store owner failed to take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect invitees from these foreseeable dangerous conditions\u2026 Adoption of this approach would not hold owners strictly liable\u2026 but would only make an owner liable if the owner could reasonably foresee that a dangerous condition exists and failed to take adequate steps to forestall resulting injuries."

Cardozo\u2019s opinion limits duty to those within the range of reasonably foreseeable risk; it does not establish a general affirmative duty like that claimed for HomeGoods, nor does it address premises liability or store safety standards. Thus, citing Palsgraf as direct authority that a retailer owes a duty to maintain safe shelving is inaccurate, even though the case is relevant to the broader concept of duty and foreseeability.",

The principles discussed concern the measure of damages for breach of the implied warranty of habitability in subsidized housing, not a commercial store\u2019s duty of care to invitees, so it does not support the cited proposition about HomeGoods\u2019 duty to shoppers.",

The court ultimately holds that the landowner\u2019s duty generally does not extend to adjacent public streets it does not control, and it expressly declines to expand premises liability in that way. Although the opinion restates the general rule that owners must maintain their premises in reasonably safe condition, the holding does not address or support the specific proposition about securing merchandise on store shelves.",

This duty includes an obligation to maintain the premises in reasonably safe condition and to warn visitors of any unreasonable dangers of which the landowner is aware or reasonably should be aware.... Although a landowner or possessor typically is not held to any duty with respect to public highways adjacent to or crossing his land, he must exercise reasonable care in the use of his land so as not to injure a traveler on the highway."
