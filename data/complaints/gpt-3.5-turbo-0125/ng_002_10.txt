COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, brings this action against Defendant, John Thompson, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Defendant, John Thompson, is an individual believed to reside at [Defendant's Address].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 218, § 4.

4. Venue is proper in the Newton Division of the Middlesex Superior Court where the incident giving rise to this action occurred.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at Newton Commonwealth Park in Newton, MA, Plaintiff was jogging on a designated path within the park.

6. Despite park regulations requiring all dogs to be on leashes, Defendant's large dog was running loose without a leash nearby.

7. As Plaintiff was running, Defendant's dog suddenly charged at her, barking loudly and menacingly.

8. Although Defendant was present approximately thirty feet away and held the dog's leash over his shoulder, he failed to restrain or control the dog effectively.

9. In fear of being bitten by the dog, Plaintiff swerved off the path to avoid contact, tripping over a tree root and falling down a small embankment.

10. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a broken wrist, requiring medical treatment, including an ER visit and the need for a brace for weeks.

11. The incident caused Plaintiff to incur approximately $3,500 in medical expenses and lose approximately $1,200 in wages due to missed work and a scheduled piano recital.

CAUSES OF ACTION

12. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to control his dog in a public park where leash laws were in effect.

13. Defendant breached this duty by allowing his dog to run loose, creating a foreseeable risk of harm to others using the park, including Plaintiff.

14. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries, including the broken wrist sustained during the fall.

15. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, financial losses, and emotional distress.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant John Thompson for:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $4,700;

b. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as allowed by law;

c. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
