Dage\u2011MTI, Inc., an Indiana Supreme Court decision addressing corporate officers\u2019 inherent authority in contract, not Massachusetts negligence principles.

We find the concept of inherent authority \u2014 rather than actual or apparent authority \u2014 controls our analysis in this case."

Instead, it is a dissenting opinion in an Illinois employment/handbook case discussing disclaimers, Duldulao, and grievance procedures. Therefore, this citation does not support the stated proposition about Massachusetts negligence law.",

When one reviews the majority\u2019s opinion and compares the disclaimer of contract in the instant case with that in Perman v. ArcVentures, Inc. (1990), 196 Ill. App. 3d 758, 554 N.E.2d 982, cited by the majority, one finds that the disclaimer in the Perman case was much stronger, yet enforceable contractual rights concerning discharge procedures were found.\""
