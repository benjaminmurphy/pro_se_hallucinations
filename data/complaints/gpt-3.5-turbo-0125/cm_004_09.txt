v.

Mark Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and files the following Complaint for Modification of a Custody Order:

I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], City of [City], [State], [Zip Code]. Plaintiff may be reached at the phone number (617) 555-0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is an adult individual formerly residing at [Defendant's Address], City of [City], [State], [Zip Code].

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, which has jurisdiction over this matter. The original custody order was entered on April 15, 2018, under docket number [Insert Docket Number].

III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. The parties are the parents of Ethan Johnson, born on [Child's Date of Birth], who is currently eight years old.

5. Pursuant to the original custody order dated April 15, 2018, Plaintiff was granted primary physical custody of the minor child, and Defendant was granted visitation consisting of three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon, with no overnights.

6. Since the issuance of the original custody order, there has been a substantial change in circumstances. Ethan Johnson is now eight years old, attending school full time, and desires to have overnight visitation with Defendant at his new residence, where Ethan has his own bedroom.

7. The current visitation schedule, which includes short visits during the week, is no longer suitable for Ethan's age, school schedule, and well-being. The constant back-and-forth transportation interferes with Ethan's schoolwork, homework, and bedtime routines, causing undue stress and exhaustion for the child.

8. Both parties, Plaintiff and Defendant, agree that the visitation schedule needs to be modified to provide Ethan with overnight stays at Defendant's residence in consideration of the child's age and school commitments.

IV. REQUESTED RELIEF

9. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to grant Defendant overnight visitation with the minor child, Ethan Johnson, on specified days and times as agreed upon by the parties or determined by the Court.

10. Plaintiff further requests such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable in the circumstances.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, prays for modification of the custody order in accordance with the foregoing allegations and requests and for any additional relief deemed just and proper by this Honorable Court.

DATED: December 1, 2025.
