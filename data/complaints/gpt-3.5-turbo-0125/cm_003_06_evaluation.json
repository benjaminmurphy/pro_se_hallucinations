The opinion focuses on G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 and removal, not on the separate doctrinal standard governing custody modifications. Thus, citing Yannas for a general custody-modification standard is inaccurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe judge properly applied the correct legal standard in determining that the wife could remove the children to Greece\u2026 The judge followed the principles set forth in Hale v. Hale\u2026 which adopted the less strict standard of D\u2019Onofrio v. D\u2019Onofrio, \u2026 The less strict standard, sometimes called the \u2018real advantage\u2019 standard\u2026 As most recently reformulated by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in Cooper v. Cooper, the \u2018real advantage\u2019 test is grounded on the realization that after a divorce a child\u2019s subsequent relationship with both parents can never be the same as before the divorce\u2026\u201d"

Instead, it addresses a municipal employee\u2019s wage-differential payments and interest under workers\u2019 compensation and a special act. Because the case neither involves family law nor discusses standards for modifying custody, it cannot support the claimed proposition about changes affecting the welfare of a child as grounds for modifying a custody order.",
