PARTIES

2. The Defendant, John Smith, is an individual and the owner of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of a personal injury claim within the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in Berkshire Superior Court, Pittsfield, MA, as the events giving rise to this action occurred within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, at the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, Defendant, as the property owner, owed a duty of care to maintain the trees on his property in a safe condition.

6. Plaintiff frequently walked on the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant's property where a large maple tree with a cracked and droopy branch overhung the sidewalk.

7. Despite being aware of the hazardous condition of the branch as reported by neighbors and observers, Defendant failed to take any action to address or remove the dangerous branch.

8. On the aforementioned date, during a thunderstorm, the cracked branch finally snapped and fell onto Plaintiff while she was walking by, causing her to sustain a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.

9. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence in failing to address the hazardous condition of the tree branch, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $400 in wages due to missed work.
