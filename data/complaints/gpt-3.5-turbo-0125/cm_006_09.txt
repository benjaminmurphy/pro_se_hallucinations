David Ramirez
Plaintiff

v.

Jessica Davis
Defendant

Docket No. [to be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, David Ramirez, and hereby alleges as follows:

1. The parties to this action are David Ramirez, Plaintiff, residing at [your address], and Jessica Davis, Defendant, residing at [defendant's address].

2. The minor children of the parties are Emily Ramirez, born on [date], currently aged 10, and Noah Ramirez, born on [date], currently aged 8.

3. The original custody order was entered on June 15, 2021, by this Honorable Court, granting primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, with Defendant having alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

4. There has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order, specifically relating to the home environment of Defendant Jessica Davis. Defendant now cohabitates with an individual known to have a criminal record for assault and battery, a history of restraining orders, and who poses a risk to the wellbeing and safety of the minor children. The presence of this individual during visits with the children has resulted in concerning incidents, including verbal aggression, physical aggression towards the children, and police intervention due to disturbances at the residence during the children's presence.

5. The current circumstances pose a significant risk to the physical and emotional wellbeing of the children. In the best interest of the children's safety and welfare, it is necessary to modify the existing custody arrangement.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff David Ramirez respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the minor children, specifically by:

a) Prohibiting the presence of [name of the individual] during any visitation with the minor children; or
b) Requiring that all visitation between Defendant Jessica Davis and the minor children be supervised by a neutral third party.

Plaintiff prays for such further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Date: December 1, 2025

David Ramirez, Plaintiff
