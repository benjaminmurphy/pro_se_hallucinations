IN THE BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
--------------------------------------------------
Rachel Thompson, Plaintiff,
v.
Mark Johnson, Defendant.
--------------------------------------------------
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION
----------------------------------

Now comes the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, hereby filing this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Johnson, and in support thereof states as follows:

1. The Parties
The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, resides at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code]. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. Identification of Children
The parties are the parents of two minor children:
- Emily, born on [Date of Birth], currently 8 years old.
- Noah, born on [Date of Birth], currently 6 years old.

3. Background Information
On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a custody order establishing that the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the children, while the Defendant has visitation rights on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

4. Allegations
Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a significant change in circumstances that adversely affects the children's well-being. Specifically, the Defendant now cohabitates with an individual with a criminal record for assault and battery, and a history of domestic violence as evidenced by a prior restraining order. The said individual has been observed engaging in aggressive behavior, including yelling, slamming doors, and physically harming one of the minor children, leaving visible marks on the child's arm. Additionally, a neighbor recently reported a loud argument at the Defendant's residence, prompting police intervention during a time when the children were present.

5. Legal Basis for Modification
It is well-settled law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that custody orders may be modified upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the children (Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985)). The presence of an individual with a history of violence and aggressive behavior in close proximity to the children constitutes a significant change in circumstances warranting a modification of the existing custody order to protect the children's physical and emotional well-being.

6. Requested Modification
The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to either prohibit the presence of the aforementioned individual during the Defendant's parenting time with the children, or in the alternative, to require that all visits with the Defendant be supervised to ensure the safety and welfare of the minor children.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, prays for the following relief:
- A modification of the current custody order to address the aforementioned concerns regarding the Defendant's cohabitant.
- Such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Rachel Thompson, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE
I hereby certify that a true copy of the foregoing Complaint for Modification has been served on the Defendant, Mark Johnson, via certified mail, return receipt requested, on this 1st day of December, 2025.
