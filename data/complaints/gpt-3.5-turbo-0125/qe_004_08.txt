In the District Court
For the County of Worcester
[Your Full Name], Plaintiff
v.
[Landlord's Full Name], Defendant

COMPLAINT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, [Your Name], and for her Complaint against Defendant [Landlord's Name], states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, [Your Name], is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

2. The Defendant, [Landlord's Name], is an individual doing business in Worcester, MA.

3. This action arises out of a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On June 1, 2020, the Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant for the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

5. Beginning approximately three months ago, the Plaintiff discovered evidence of a mouse infestation in the kitchen of the leased premises, including mouse droppings.

6. Upon notifying the Defendant of the issue, the Defendant minimally addressed the problem by placing a few traps, which failed to fully resolve the infestation.

7. Despite the Plaintiff's persistent complaints and the advice of an exterminator indicating the need for more comprehensive treatment, the Defendant failed to take adequate measures to eradicate the infestation, asserting that the issue is "normal for older buildings."

8. The Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages as a result of the infestation, including the loss of approximately $200 worth of food items and an additional expense of $80 in purchasing plastic containers to store food securely.

CAUSE OF ACTION

9. The Defendant's failure to promptly and adequately address the mouse infestation constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Award damages in the amount of $280 to compensate the Plaintiff for the losses incurred as a result of the Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
2. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and equitable; and
3. Award the Plaintiff the costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in prosecuting this action.

Respectfully submitted,
