      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns modification of an existing custody order based on substantial changes in circumstances and a best-interests analysis, seeking a change in primary physical custody. Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas involves an initial divorce judgment awarding physical custody to the mother and permission to remove the children to Greece; it does not address standards for later modification of custody orders due to changed circumstances, nor does it involve transferring primary physical custody from one parent to another. Thus it does not provide authority for the specific modification request described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe judge was warranted in concluding that physical custody in the wife was in the best interests of each child. There was extensive evidence concerning the children\u2019s relations with their parents. The judge addressed the needs of the children and considered the physical care that each parent gave to each child. The fact that the evidence might have warranted a different decision on physical custody does not make the judge\u2019s determination invalid.\u201d"

Custody of Vaughn concerns an initial contested custody determination and the need for explicit findings about the impact of domestic violence on the child; it does not address the legal standard for post\u2011judgment modification based on changed circumstances or endorse a request to transfer primary custody on that basis. Thus it does not provide authority for the specific modification proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Accordingly, we remand the case to the Probate Court for such explicit findings, both as we require in this decision and as we state are required by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. We do not by this decision require the judge to hear further testimony if he does not consider that necessary, but at the least he must hear both parties and make explicit findings on the matters set out above.\""

It does not address family law, child custody, \u201cbest interests of the children,\u201d or standards for modifying custody orders. Therefore it cannot serve as authority for modifying a custody order to grant primary physical custody based on substantial changes in circumstances.",

Antonucci, brought a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendant, F & J Gattozzi Corporation (F & J), alleging a breach of an oral contract, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment.

Bodie (despite the caption given) is actually a tort case about liability of parents for the intentional shooting committed by their adult son and about whether the son\u2019s conduct was negligent or intentional. The opinion does not address child custody, domestic relations, or standards for modifying custody orders, so it cannot support the cited custody proposition.",

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns modification of an existing custody order to change primary physical custody between parents based on a substantial change in circumstances and the children\u2019s best interests. Blixt v. Blixt addresses the constitutionality and construction of Massachusetts\u2019 grandparent visitation statute, standards of harm, parental due process rights, and equal protection in the context of third\u2011party (grandparent) visitation, not parent-versus-parent custody modification. It neither sets out the legal standard for modifying custody orders nor discusses reallocating primary physical custody between parents, so it does not support the cited proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe statute adopts the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard as the test for determining visitation. This standard has long been used in Massachusetts to decide issues of custody and visitation and other issues relating to child welfare. The statute, however, uses the standard in a new context\u2026 We conclude, in rejection of the facial due process challenge made by the mother, that the statute satisfies strict scrutiny because our construction narrowly tailors it to further the compelling State interest in protecting the welfare of a child who has experienced a disruption in the family unit from harm.\u201d"
