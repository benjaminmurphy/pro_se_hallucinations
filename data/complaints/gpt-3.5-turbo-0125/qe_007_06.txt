COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX

Liam Johnson
Plaintiff

v.

Marissa Kent
Defendant

CASE NO.: [to be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Liam Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and files this Complaint against the Defendant, Marissa Kent, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Liam Johnson, is an individual residing at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138.

2. The Defendant, Marissa Kent, is an individual who owns and manages the property where the Plaintiff resides.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter and venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On June 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant for a unit located at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138.

5. Beginning on or around October 1, 2025, the Defendant commenced significant renovation work on the unit adjacent to the Plaintiff's, resulting in ongoing construction noise during the day, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers.

6. The construction noise and disruptions have continued for approximately two months, from about 8 AM to 5 PM on weekdays, causing significant interference with the Plaintiff's ability to work from home, concentrate on calls, and enjoy the quiet use and enjoyment of his rented premises.

7. The Plaintiff has experienced dust entering his unit through the vents as a result of the ongoing construction activities.

8. While the Defendant provided notice of the renovation project before its commencement and the workers have maintained reasonable working hours, the prolonged duration and extent of the disruptions have substantially interfered with the Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION

9. The Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential lease in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which requires landlords to provide tenants with peaceful and quiet possession of their rented premises.

10. The Defendant's failure to effectively manage and mitigate the construction disruptions has materially interfered with the Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of the premises in violation of Massachusetts law.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief from this Honorable Court:

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

1. Judgment in favor of the Plaintiff, Liam Johnson, for compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $600.

2. An order directing the Defendant, Marissa Kent, to cease the construction activities causing the disruptions and to take all necessary steps to rectify the disturbances.

3. Such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and equitable.
