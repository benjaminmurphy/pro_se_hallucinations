In the Matter of:
Rachel Bennett, Plaintiff,
v.
Thomas Bennett, Defendant.

Complaint for Modification
Case Number: [Insert Case Number]

Now comes the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, by and through the undersigned, and in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, hereby files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order, and alleges as follows:

1. The parties to this action are Rachel Bennett, residing at [Your Address], and Thomas Bennett, residing at [Defendant's Address]. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Ethan Bennett, aged 8.

2. On April 15, 2019, this Honorable Court entered a custody order granting primary physical custody of the minor child to the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, and providing the Defendant, Thomas Bennett, with three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.

3. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a substantial change in circumstances. The minor child, Ethan, is now 8 years old, attending school full-time, and expressing a strong desire for overnight stays at his father's residence. Additionally, the Defendant, Thomas Bennett, now resides in a suitable accommodation with adequate space for the child to have his own bedroom.

4. The current custody arrangement, which requires the minor child to be shuttled back and forth multiple times during the week for short visits, is no longer in the best interest of the child. This schedule disrupts the child's school routine, homework, and bedtime, causing undue stress and inconvenience for all parties involved.

5. Both parties, Plaintiff and Defendant, mutually agree that the existing custody arrangement is no longer appropriate for the child's age and school commitments. Therefore, the Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody order to allow for overnight stays at the Defendant's residence, in a manner that best serves the child's welfare and development.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to:
a. Modify the existing custody order to allow for overnight stays at the Defendant's residence in the best interest of the minor child, Ethan Bennett; and
b. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

[Your Signature]
Rachel Bennett
