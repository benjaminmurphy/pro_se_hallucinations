Jessica Miller
Plaintiff

v.

Kevin Miller
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION 

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller ("Jessica"), by and through undersigned counsel, and hereby submits this Complaint for Modification seeking a change in the existing custody order in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Miller.

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, is a resident of [Your City], Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Kevin Miller, is a resident of [Defendant's City], Massachusetts.

3. The minor child subject to this action is Emily Miller, born on [Child's Date of Birth].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 215, Section 6.

5. Venue is proper in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court as the original custody order in question was entered in this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 15, 2018, the Court entered a custody order granting primary residence to the Defendant, Kevin Miller, and limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner to the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller.

7. At the time of the original custody order, Jessica was completing graduate school, resided in a small studio apartment, and had limited flexibility in her schedule.

8. Since the entry of the original order, significant changes have occurred in Jessica's circumstances. She has completed her education, secured a stable job with normal hours, and now resides in a two-bedroom apartment where the minor child can have her own room.

9. The minor child, Emily, has developed a close and loving relationship with Jessica during the limited visitation periods. Emily's therapist has noted her desire for more time with Jessica, expressing feelings of guilt when having to leave after short visits.

10. Emily has even articulated her desire for additional overnights at Jessica's residence by writing a letter to the Court.

11. Despite these changes and Emily's expressed wishes, the Defendant, Kevin, has refused to consider modifications to the existing custody arrangement and becomes agitated when the topic is raised.

REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

12. Jessica respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to allow for an adjustment in the parenting plan that reflects the changed circumstances and the minor child's best interests. Specifically, Jessica seeks an expanded parenting time schedule to provide for additional overnights with Emily.

LEGAL GROUNDS

13. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28 provides that the Court maintains jurisdiction to modify custody orders upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances.

14. Recent case law in Massachusetts, including decisions such as Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 484 Mass. 19 (2019), and Harrison v. Thompson, 991 N.E.2d 1045 (Mass. 2013), emphasize the importance of considering the child's best interests and the need to adapt custody arrangements to reflect the evolving needs of the child.

WHEREFORE, Jessica respectfully requests this Honorable Court to grant the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to allow for an adjustment in the parenting plan;
2. Order an expanded parenting time schedule to provide for additional overnights with the minor child;
3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
