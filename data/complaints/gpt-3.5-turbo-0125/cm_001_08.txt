v.

Michael Davis,
Defendant

Case No.: [Insert Case Number]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

COMES NOW, Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff"), through undersigned counsel, and hereby files this Complaint for Modification of Custody against Michael Davis ("Defendant"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is the mother of Emily Thompson and Jacob Thompson, the minor children subject to the custody order issued by this Honorable Court on April 15, 2021.

2. Defendant, Michael Davis, is the father of the minor children and is currently in violation of the existing custody order.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
3. Pursuant to the custody order in effect since April 15, 2021, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the minor children, with Defendant having the children every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

4. Since the entry of the custody order, Defendant has taken on a new job working from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week. As a result, Defendant has been unable to fulfill his parental responsibilities during his scheduled overnights with the children.

5. Defendant has been regularly failing to provide adequate care for the children during his scheduled parenting time. The children have reported to Plaintiff that they often fall asleep unattended on the couch while Defendant naps after coming home from work.

6. Defendant has been leaving the children with his roommate, a person with whom Plaintiff has limited familiarity, due to his exhaustion from work.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION
7. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the current custody order to only allow Defendant to have the children for overnights when he is not scheduled to work the overnight shifts. This modification is necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor children.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which provides for modification of custody orders.

9. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court as this is the court that issued the original custody order and the court where the minor children primarily reside.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
1. Modify the existing custody order to restrict Defendant's overnights to nights when he is not scheduled to work;
2. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025

I hereby certify that a true copy of the foregoing Complaint for Modification of Custody was served on Defendant by [method of service] on [date].
