Middlesex Probate and Family Court

Samantha Johnson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Johnson
Defendant

Docket No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Johnson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

3. The parties are the parents of two children: Emily Johnson, born [DOB], and Ethan Johnson, born [DOB].

4. The original custody order was entered on May 15, 2020, by this Honorable Court.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which provides for modification of custody orders.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Pursuant to the original custody order, the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the children, with the Defendant having the children every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

7. Since the entry of the original custody order, a significant change in circumstances has occurred. The Defendant recently took on a new job working from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week, including the nights he is scheduled to have the children overnight.

8. The Defendant has failed to provide adequate care for the children during his overnights. He has been dropping the children off at the Plaintiff's residence with minimal notice, citing fatigue from work as the reason. The children report falling asleep on the couch while the Defendant naps upon returning home from work. The Defendant's roommate, an individual unfamiliar to the Plaintiff, has been left in charge of the children during the Defendant's absence.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

9. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to ensure that the children's overnights with the Defendant occur only when he is not working and available to provide proper care and supervision.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

(a) Modify the existing custody order to restrict the Defendant's overnights with the children to days when he is off work and available to provide appropriate care and supervision; and

(b) Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
