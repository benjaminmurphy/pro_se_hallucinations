COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, EMILY JOHNSON, is an individual residing at [Plaintiff's Address], Springfield, MA.

2. Defendant, MARK THOMPSON, is an individual residing at [Defendant's Address], Springfield, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction of this Court is proper pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223, section 2, as the matter in controversy exceeds the sum of $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Venue is proper as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Hampden County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about March 15, 2023, at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105, Defendant, Mark Thompson, negligently kept a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against the wooden fence in the shared driveway of Plaintiff’s duplex.

5. Plaintiff had expressed concerns to Defendant about the ladder posing a danger to her car parked in the driveway, especially on windy days. Despite Plaintiff's warning, Defendant failed to secure or relocate the ladder.

6. On the aforementioned date, due to Defendant's negligence, a gust of wind knocked the ladder over, causing it to crash onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff's car, resulting in damage to the hood and a cracked windshield. As a direct result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred expenses for necessary repairs, including a new windshield, and had to pay a deductible for insurance coverage.

CAUSE OF ACTION

7. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to maintain his property in a safe manner and prevent foreseeable harm. Defendant breached this duty by negligently keeping the ladder unsecured near Plaintiff's car, despite being aware of the risk it posed.

8. Defendant's breach of duty was a proximate cause of the damage to Plaintiff's car, resulting in financial loss and inconvenience to Plaintiff.

9. The negligent actions of Defendant constitute negligence under Massachusetts law, giving rise to a cause of action for negligence.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Award damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $25,000, for the cost of repairs, rental car expenses, and inconvenience suffered by Plaintiff;

b. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

c. Award costs and attorney fees incurred in prosecuting this action; and

d. Grant any further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Respectfully submitted,
