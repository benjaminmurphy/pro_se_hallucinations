In the Matter of: Jessica Sullivan v. Mark Thompson
Case Number: [to be assigned by the court]

Complaint for Modification

Comes now Jessica Sullivan, of [Your Address], in [City], [State], and hereby files this Complaint for Modification against Mark Thompson, the other parent, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, seeking a modification of the existing custody arrangement as detailed herein. The parties were previously granted shared legal custody of their minor child, Ethan Thompson, by this Honorable Court on September 15, 2021.

Factual Allegations:
1. At the time of the original custody order, the court deemed both parties as capable and stable co-parents.

2. Recent concerning incidents have raised serious doubts about the safety and well-being of Ethan while in Mark Thompson's care:
   a. Ethan has reported the existence of "special drinks" at Mark's residence and observed instances where Mark "can't walk straight."
   b. An anonymous video provided by a concerned neighbor captures Mark stumbling while handling Ethan late at night.
   c. Reports from the school suggest that Ethan appears exhausted every Monday, possibly indicating inadequate care or supervision during his time with Mark.

3. These circumstances indicate a material change warranting an immediate modification of the custody arrangement to ensure Ethan's safety and well-being.

Requested Modification:
1. Jessica Sullivan requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to require supervised overnights for Ethan while in Mark Thompson's care, or any other necessary conditions to ensure his safety.

Wherefore, Jessica Sullivan respectfully requests this Honorable Court for a modification of the existing custody order in the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Thompson, for his safety and well-being.
