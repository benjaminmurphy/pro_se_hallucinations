Laura Smith
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, and respectfully states as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Laura Smith, is a resident of Massachusetts whose address is [Your Address].
1.2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is a resident of Massachusetts whose address is [Defendant's Address].

2. Factual Allegations
2.1. On May 15, 2019, an original custody order was entered by this Honorable Court granting primary custody to the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, and providing the Defendant, Mark Johnson, with custody every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.
2.2. Since the entry of the original custody order, circumstances have substantially changed. The Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the Plaintiff's residence.
2.3. The Defendant insists on maintaining the midweek overnight visitation as per the original order, resulting in a substantial hardship for the minor child, Emily Johnson. The midweek overnight visitation requires extensive travel for the child, leading to exhaustion and a noticeable decline in participation at school on Thursdays.
2.4. The child's well-being is at risk due to the long-distance travel and disrupted sleep schedule associated with the Defendant's insistence on the midweek overnight visitation.

3. Requested Modification
3.1. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation on Wednesdays and adjust the weekend schedule to ensure the well-being and best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson.

4. Statutory Basis for Modification
4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, the Court may modify a custody order as it deems necessary upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the original order.
4.2. The circumstances outlined above constitute a material change warranting modification of the existing custody order to ensure the child's best interests and well-being.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays for the following relief:
1. Modification of the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation on Wednesdays.
2. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
