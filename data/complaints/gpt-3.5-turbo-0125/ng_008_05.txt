5. On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a patron at the Quincy Family Restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169.

6. While in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and dining room, a server of the Defendant dropped a tray with several water glasses, causing water and ice to spill onto the tile floor.

7. The server failed to promptly clean up the spilled water and ice, neglected to place any warning signs or barriers, and left the hazardous condition unattended.
