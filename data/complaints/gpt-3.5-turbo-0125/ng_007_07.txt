PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, James Thompson, is an individual residing at [Address], Brockton, MA.

2. Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a corporation located at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, MA 02302.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. The subject matter of this action is within the jurisdiction of this Court as it involves claims for negligence stemming from an incident that occurred within the geographical boundaries of Brockton, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On September 15, 2023, at the premises of the Brockton Community Center located at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, MA 02302, Plaintiff's minor child was attending an after-school program supervised by the Defendant.

5. Despite representations by the Defendant that children would be supervised at all times in the gym, on the date in question, a staff member of the Defendant left the gym area unattended to attend to paperwork in the office.

6. The staff member who remained in the gym was observed to be preoccupied with her phone near the bleachers and failed to properly supervise the children, which included two older boys engaging in rough and physical play on the hardwood floor.

7. Several children, including Plaintiff's son, brought to the staff member's attention the rough game being played, but she dismissed the concerns with a nonchalant attitude, stating "boys will be boys."

8. As a result of the negligent supervision by the Defendant's staff, Plaintiff's eight-year-old son, who is small for his age, was tackled forcefully by one of the older and larger boys, causing him to hit his head on the hard floor and lose consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

10. Defendant owed a duty of care to the children attending its after-school program, including Plaintiff's son, to provide adequate and proper supervision to prevent reasonably foreseeable harms.

11. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to provide adequate supervision, allowing rough play despite notice, and failing to prevent the injuries sustained by Plaintiff's son.

12. The breach of duty by the Defendant was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries suffered by Plaintiff's son, including a concussion, loss of consciousness, medical expenses, and missed school days.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief from this Honorable Court:

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $5,000 for medical expenses incurred as a result of the incident.
