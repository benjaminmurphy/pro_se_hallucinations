COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant John Smith, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at [Plaintiff's Address], Pittsfield, MA 01201.

2. Defendant John Smith is a resident of Pittsfield, Massachusetts and the owner of the property located at 123 Maple St, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action seeking damages for personal injuries caused by the negligence of the Defendant. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits and the parties are located within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Carter was walking on the sidewalk in front of Defendant John Smith's property at 123 Maple St, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

5. A large branch of a maple tree located on Defendant's property, overhanging the sidewalk, was visibly cracked and droopy for some time prior to the incident.

6. Despite being made aware of the hazardous condition by neighbors and being advised to seek professional inspection and remediation, Defendant failed to take action to address the dangerous condition of the tree branch.

7. During a regular summer thunderstorm on August 15, 2023, the cracked branch finally snapped and fell on Plaintiff, causing her to sustain a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.

8. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff required medical treatment and incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses. Additionally, she lost around $600 in wages due to the injuries sustained.

CAUSES OF ACTION

9. The Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain the property in a safe condition for pedestrians, including ensuring that overhanging tree branches were not hazardous to passersby.

10. The Defendant breached this duty of care by failing to promptly address the known dangerous condition of the cracked and droopy tree branch, which directly resulted in harm to the Plaintiff.

11. The Defendant's breach of duty was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

12. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant's negligence, the Plaintiff suffered bodily injuries, incurred medical expenses, and lost wages.
