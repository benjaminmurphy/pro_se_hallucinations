Roche is relevant case law supporting the plaintiff\u2019s claims (which, from context, are premises-liability slip\u2011and\u2011fall claims in a self\u2011service store). Sheehan directly addresses store-owner negligence in a slip-and-fall on produce, adopts the plaintiff-favorable mode-of-operation approach, and reverses summary judgment for the defendant. It is therefore properly cited as supporting authority for a plaintiff\u2019s premises-liability theory in similar circumstances.",

The opinion excerpt concerns only a procedural issue: waiver of appellate review of a denied directed verdict motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 50(a) when the moving party proceeds to introduce evidence. It does not reach or decide the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s tort/negligence claims and therefore does not substantively support unspecified \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d",

P. 50 (a)\u2026 to assert error in the judge\u2019s refusal to grant a directed verdict and thus judgment must be affirmed.\u2026 Following the reasoning of the Federal courts, we conclude that the defendant, under Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (a), waived his claim of error on introducing evidence of his own, and thus there is no basis for an appeal.\u201d"
