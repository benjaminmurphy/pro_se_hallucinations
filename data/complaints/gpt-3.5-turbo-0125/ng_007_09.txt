Ethan Johnson, Plaintiff

v.

Brockton Community Center, Defendant

Case No: [to be assigned by the court]
Date of Incident: March 15, 2023
Date of Complaint: December 1, 2025

COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Ethan Johnson, is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a community center located at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, MA 02302.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On March 15, 2023, at the premises of the Brockton Community Center, the Defendant operated an after-school program for children.

4. The Defendant advertised that children in the after-school program would be supervised at all times in the gym area.

5. On the said date, there were approximately twenty children in the gym supervised by two staff members, one of whom left the area to perform administrative tasks in the office.

6. The remaining staff member, instead of actively supervising the children, was distracted by her phone and positioned herself near the bleachers, not actively monitoring the activities of the children.

7. Two older boys began engaging in a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor, which posed a danger to the other children present.

8. Despite concerns raised by some of the children regarding the rough play, the staff member dismissed the complaints, stating "boys will be boys."

9. As a result of the staff's failure to adequately supervise the children and intervene in unsafe activities, Plaintiff's eight-year-old son, a participant in the after-school program, was violently tackled by one of the older boys, hitting his head on the floor and losing consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.

10. The Plaintiff's son sustained a concussion and confusion as a direct result of the negligent supervision and failure to provide a safe environment.

11. The Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,800 in medical expenses and lost $1,200 in wages due to the incident.

CAUSES OF ACTION

12. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, owed a duty of care to the children participating in the after-school program to provide adequate supervision and ensure a safe environment.

13. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to supervise the children properly, allowing dangerous activities to take place, and neglecting to intervene when alerted to the potential harm.

14. The Defendant's breach of duty was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's son's injuries and resulting damages.

15. The Defendant's negligent acts and omissions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Award damages in an amount to be proven at trial but not less than $5,800 for medical expenses and $1,200 for lost wages;

b. Award prejudgment interest as allowed by law;

c. Award the costs of this action; and

d. Grant any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
