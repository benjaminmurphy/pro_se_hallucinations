The District Attorney is directed to enter an order amending the judgment of conviction to show the subsequent holding of the Huntley hearing and the finding of voluntariness, and to serve notice of entry of the order upon defendant and his attorney so that defendant may file a timely amended notice of appeal from the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals."

Currie, however, is not a negligence case; it deals with breach of fiduciary duty and related equitable remedies (e.g., forfeiture of compensation) arising from disloyal executive employees. It does not analyze or apply Massachusetts negligence standards, so it does not provide authority for a negligence-based proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The master found, however, that the defendants, as well as Graff and Wormwood, acted in violation of their fiduciary duties in the purchase of equipment for a price in excess of its fair market value, in the solicitation of Ideal\u2019s customers, in their preparation of a customer list and of an SBA loan application which included the names of prospective customers, most of whom were customers of Ideal, and in their agreement to leave Ideal simultaneously.\""

It does not address negligence, civil liability, or Massachusetts negligence law in any way. Therefore, citing O'Keefe v. Sarsfield for a general proposition that a complaint is based on Massachusetts negligence law is inaccurate and unsupported by this text.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"A fundamental proposition of our system of criminal justice is that a defendant cannot be convicted of a crime absent a proper instruction to the jury on the elements of the crime with which he stands charged. The duty to instruct properly falls on the trial judge. ... An essential element of the crime of murder is proof of malice aforethought.\""

Schofield squarely concerns Massachusetts negligence and premises\u2011liability doctrine, discussing the duty owed by landowners, the standard of care, and the treatment of trespassers versus other entrants. Although the case ultimately denies a duty to adult trespassers, it is clearly a Massachusetts negligence decision and can properly serve as part of the negligence-law foundation for a complaint (even if cited for background or to distinguish).",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The plaintiff's amended complaint alleges that he was injured due to the negligence of the defendants 'in the care, operation and maintenance' of land owned and controlled by them... The question before us is whether we should abolish our common law rule that a landowner is not liable to an adult trespasser for injuries resulting from the landowner's negligence. We conclude that the rule should be retained... The traditional rule in this Commonwealth is that a trespasser is entitled to no greater duty of care...\""

Bishop (actually this opinion is DiMarzo v. American Mutual) concerns an insurer\u2019s bad-faith failure to settle and Chapter 93A/176D unfair settlement practices, not the elements of ordinary negligence or general negligence doctrine. While it involves an underlying tort case, the opinion\u2019s holdings focus on insurer duties and Chapter 93A remedies, so it does not serve as direct authority for a generic Massachusetts negligence-law proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAmerican Mutual does not challenge that the breach of an insurer\u2019s duty to act in good faith to settle a claim brought against an insured within the policy limits, see Murach v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 339 Mass. 184, 186-187 (1959), provides a sufficient basis for recovery under c. 93A, \u00a7 9.\u201d"
