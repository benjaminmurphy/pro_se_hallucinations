IN THE LOWELL DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX
MASSACHUSETTS

Jessica Moore,
Plaintiff

v.

Karen Thompson,
Defendant

Case No.: [To be Assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Jessica Moore, by and through undersigned counsel, brings this action against Defendant, Karen Thompson, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Moore, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. Defendant, Karen Thompson, is the landlord of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852, where Plaintiff resides.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as it involves a landlord-tenant dispute arising within the County of Middlesex, Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

6. Since taking possession of the premises, Plaintiff has encountered a mold infestation in the bathroom, which initially appeared in the shower corner and has since spread to the ceiling.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold issue, after which Defendant inspected the premises and attributed the problem to Plaintiff's alleged failure to run the exhaust fan adequately and taking hot showers.

8. Despite the negative impacts on Plaintiff's health, including respiratory issues such as coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which Plaintiff's healthcare provider attributes to the mold exposure, Defendant has failed to take appropriate action to remediate the mold or improve ventilation in the bathroom.

9. As a direct result of the mold infestation, Plaintiff has incurred damages amounting to approximately $250, including the cost of replacing a shower curtain and towels contaminated by mold.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant's failure to address the mold infestation and provide habitable living conditions constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

11. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14 states that tenants have the right to a dwelling free from mold infestations that substantially endanger their health or safety and require prompt remediation by the landlord.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Moore respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Order Defendant to promptly remediate the mold infestation in the bathroom and improve ventilation to prevent future occurrences;
b. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $250 for losses incurred due to the mold exposure;
c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
