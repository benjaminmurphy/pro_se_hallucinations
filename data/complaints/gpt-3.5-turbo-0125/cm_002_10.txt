Jessica Martinez, Plaintiff
v.
David Brown, Defendant
Docket No. [To be Assigned]

Complaint for Modification of Custody Order

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, by and through undersigned counsel, and complains against the Defendant, David Brown, as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, resides at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip].
1.2. The Defendant, David Brown, resides at [Address], [City, State, Zip].

2. Factual Allegations
2.1. On March 15, 2021, a custody order was entered by this Honorable Court establishing the current custody arrangement for the parties' child, Sofia Brown, aged 8.
2.2. Pursuant to the existing order, the Plaintiff has primary custody of Sofia, with the Defendant having visitation rights on Wednesdays and every other weekend.
2.3. The current custody arrangement assumes proximity of the parties' residences and the local school. However, the Defendant now seeks to move to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while maintaining the existing visitation schedule.
2.4. The relocation to New Hampshire introduces significant challenges for Sofia, including extended and stressful drives of approximately ninety minutes each way for midweek overnights, disrupting her after-school activities and causing anxiety.
2.5. The Plaintiff, in the best interest of Sofia, seeks a modification to the custody order that eliminates the midweek overnight visitation and adjusts the weekend schedule to accommodate the increased distance resulting from the Defendant's relocation.

3. Requested Modification
The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation with the Defendant and to adjust the weekend visitation schedule to minimize the adverse effects on Sofia caused by the relocation of the Defendant to New Hampshire.

4. Legal Standard
4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208 § 28, this Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances warranting the modification in the best interest of the child.
4.2. In the case of Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), the Supreme Judicial Court held that the relocation of a parent can constitute a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of a custody arrangement.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, respectfully requests this Honorable Court grant the requested modification to the custody order and for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
[Your Signature]
Jessica Martinez, Plaintiff

DATED: December 1, 2025
