In the Matter of:

vs.

Docket No. [To be assigned by the Court]

Complaint for Modification of Custody Order

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, brings this Complaint seeking a modification of the custody order originally entered by this Honorable Court on May 20, 2015.

II. PARTIES

2. Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, resides at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

3. Defendant, Mark Taylor, resides at [His Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

4. Emily Taylor, the subject child in this matter, is a minor child of the parties, aged 10 years.

III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Sections 28 and 39.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court, as the original custody order was entered by this Court.

IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On May 20, 2015, the Court granted primary residence to Defendant, Mark Taylor, and established a visitation schedule for Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, consisting of limited weekend visits and one weeknight dinner.

8. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a substantial change in circumstances. Plaintiff has completed her graduate studies, secured stable employment with regular hours, and now resides in a two-bedroom apartment offering a suitable living arrangement for Emily.

9. Emily has expressed her desire to spend more time with Plaintiff and has written a letter to the Court requesting increased visitation at Plaintiff's residence. Emily's therapist has confirmed that the current schedule causes Emily distress and that she would benefit from more time with Plaintiff.

10. Despite Emily's expressed wishes for a modification in the custody arrangement, Defendant has refused to consider any changes and becomes upset when Emily raises the subject.

V. RELEVANT LAW

11. The modification of a custody order is governed by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28. The Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances that justifies the modification and is in the best interests of the child.

12. The case law supports modification where a substantial change in circumstances has occurred and the modification serves the child's best interests. Notable cases in this area include Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002), and Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

VI. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

13. Modify the current custody order to increase Plaintiff's parenting time with Emily.

14. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
