IN THE HOUSING COURT DEPARTMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT
FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
_____________ DIVISION

Samantha Johnson,
Plaintiff

v.

Linda Carver,
Defendant

Civil Action No. ________

COMPLAINT

Now comes Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Linda Carver, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Samantha Johnson is an individual residing at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. Defendant Linda Carver is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, particularly the Massachusetts General Laws and applicable case law.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 185C, Section 19.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court as the property in question is located at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the basement unit at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

7. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to medical bills but eventually paid the rent in full, including the late fee.

8. In November 2025, Plaintiff discovered water seeping into the basement unit through the wall during heavy rainfall. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the issue.

9. Despite Plaintiff's notification, Defendant failed to address the water seepage issue promptly, leading to damage to Plaintiff's rug, bookshelf, and increased electric bills due to the necessity of running a dehumidifier continuously.

10. Following Plaintiff's complaint, a city inspection revealed not only the water seepage but various code violations on the property.

11. Defendant responded by threatening not to renew Plaintiff's lease, citing the late rent payment, although the timing suggests an ulterior motive related to the inspection findings.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment against Defendant based on Massachusetts common law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief from this Honorable Court:

1. Damages in the amount of $400 for the destroyed property and increased electric bills;
2. Any further relief this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Samantha Johnson, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025
