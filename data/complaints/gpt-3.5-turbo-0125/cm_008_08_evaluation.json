Nothing in the decision discusses custody arrangements or post-judgment modification standards. Therefore, it cannot be cited as authority for the proposition that a material change in circumstances since a custody order warrants modification of custody.",

The opinion addresses whether Massachusetts has subject matter jurisdiction at all, and ultimately holds that Texas is the proper forum; it does not discuss or apply the legal standard for modifying an existing custody order due to a material change in circumstances. Therefore it does not support the proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo determine whether the judge\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was proper, we look to the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MCCJA). See G. L. c. 209B. \u2018The decision of a Massachusetts court to exercise jurisdiction and to make a custody determination must be based solely on G. L. c. 209B.\u2019 \u2026 We conclude that Massachusetts courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the custody of Zeke and must defer to the Texas courts.\u201d"

Therefore it cannot support the proposition that a material change in circumstances since a custody order warrants modification of custody.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The plaintiffs state that the gravamen of their claim is that the DEQE could not place a lien on their property pursuant to the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention Act, G.L.c. 21E, \"because the DEQE has incurred no costs for the `assessment, containment, and removal'\" of hazardous materials. Therefore, we look to the statute to determine how the Legislature defined \"assessment\" costs and when such costs can be the basis for a lien."

Therefore, it provides no support or authority for the claimed custody-related proposition.",

It does not concern domestic relations, custody orders, or standards for modification based on a material change in circumstances. Therefore, this opinion does not address, much less support, the proposition about a material change in circumstances warranting modification of custody.",

There is no relevant passage supporting the claimed custody-related proposition."
