v.

Mark Jenkins

To the Honorable Judge of the Probate and Family Court:

I, Laura Jenkins, the Plaintiff, respectfully state as follows:

1. The parties to this action are Laura Jenkins, residing at [her address], and Mark Jenkins, residing at [his address]. The parties were formerly married, and share a minor child, Emily Jenkins, born on [child's birthdate].

2. A Judgment of Divorce Nisi issued by this Court on May 15, 2019 (docket no. [original docket number]) established custody arrangements for Emily Jenkins. Pursuant to the order, Laura Jenkins was granted primary custody while Mark Jenkins was awarded visitation rights every other weekend and a midweek overnight visitation on Wednesdays.

3. Since the issuance of the custody order, there has been a substantial change in circumstances that affect Emily's well-being. Specifically, Mark Jenkins has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the child's primary residence. This relocation has made it significantly burdensome for Emily to maintain the current midweek overnight visitation schedule.

4. Mark Jenkins's insistence on maintaining the Wednesday overnight visitation results in Emily being subject to long and exhausting car rides during late hours, disrupting her sleep patterns and causing noticeable tiredness during school. Emily's teacher has observed a decline in her participation levels on Thursdays following these overnight visits.

5. The current custody arrangement is no longer in the best interest of the child due to the material change in circumstances. Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, seeks a modification of the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and adjust the visitation schedule to eliminate the unnecessary burden on Emily.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
a. Modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation with Mark Jenkins;
b. Adjust the visitation schedule to ensure that Emily Jenkins is not unduly burdened by extensive travel on school nights; and
c. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

Laura Jenkins
