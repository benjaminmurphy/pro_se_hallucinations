SUPERIOR COURT
SUFFOLK, SS.

JORDAN CARTER, 
Plaintiff,

v.

SUSAN BLAKE, 
Defendant.

Civil Action No. __________

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant Susan Blake, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Carter, is an individual residing at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. Defendant, Susan Blake, is the landlord of the premises located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19 and Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 185C, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223A, Section 3.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the basement unit located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

6. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to unforeseen medical bills. Plaintiff paid the rent in full, including late fees, shortly thereafter.

7. In November 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of water seepage issues in the basement unit whenever it rained heavily. Defendant responded that she would "look into it" but failed to take any corrective action.

8. Despite Plaintiff's repeated requests, Defendant failed to address the water seepage issue, leading to water damage to Plaintiff's possessions, including a rug and a bookshelf, amounting to approximately $400.

9. The water seepage issue has also necessitated Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier continuously, causing an increase in Plaintiff's electric bill.

10. As a result of the aforementioned issues, Defendant labeled Plaintiff as a "problem tenant" and notified Plaintiff that the lease would not be renewed upon its expiration in March 2026.

11. Defendant attributed the non-renewal of the lease to the late rent payment rather than the unresolved water seepage problems, which Plaintiff finds suspect given the timing of events.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

12. Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. A breach occurs when a landlord substantially interferes with a tenant's use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); Darmetko v. Boston Housing Authority, 378 Mass. 758 (1979); Gnerre v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 404 Mass. 512 (1989).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendant as follows:

1. Actual damages in the amount of $400.
2. Any further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
