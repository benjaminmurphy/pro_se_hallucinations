Rachel Thompson, Plaintiff
v.
Mark Johnson, Defendant
Civil Action No.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Johnson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, is a resident of Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is a resident of Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
3. The minor child subject to the custody order is Samantha Johnson, aged 10.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, governing modifications of custody orders.
5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County as the original custody order was entered in this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 15, 2022, a custody order was entered between the parties, granting joint legal custody with Rachel Thompson as the primary residential parent and Mark Johnson having substantial weekend time, including Sunday nights.
7. Since the inception of the custody order, the Plaintiff asserts a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the existing custody arrangement.
8. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly kept Samantha home from school on Mondays after their weekends together, without medical justification.
9. Despite the Plaintiff's concern and the school's truancy warnings, the Defendant continues to withhold Samantha from school on Mondays.
10. The Plaintiff alleges that Samantha's academic performance has suffered as a result of these unauthorized absences, with declining grades and test scores.
11. Additionally, the Defendant has regularly refused to transport Samantha to tutoring sessions scheduled during his weekends.
12. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody order to grant her final decision-making authority regarding school attendance decisions or, in the alternative, to reduce the Defendant's overnights on school nights.

REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff final authority over school attendance decisions for Samantha.
2. Alternatively, adjust the custody arrangement to limit the Defendant's overnight stays on school nights.
3. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]

Rachel Thompson, Plaintiff
