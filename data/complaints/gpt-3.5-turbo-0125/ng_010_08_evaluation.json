The court\u2019s analysis concerns duties associated with inherently dangerous products, statutory fire-prevention regulations, and proximate cause, rather than premises liability or a duty to maintain trees. Therefore, the opinion does not support the proposition about negligent failure to maintain a tree on one\u2019s property causing injury.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThose cases are inapplicable to the case at bar because, apart from any negligence arising out of the delivery of an inherently dangerous article, without notice, to a person who had no actual knowledge of its dangerous potentialities, there rested on the defendant an additional legal duty to see that the scrap film was safely disposed of. On the evidence the jury could properly find that there had been a violation of \u00a7 23 of the regulations of the fire prevention commissioner relating to motion picture film.\u201d"

We do not agree. It is the rule of this Commonwealth that negligence on the part of a seller or supplier of alcoholic beverages may be shown by a sale or the furnishing of those beverages to a minor\u2026 Thus, if a vendor fails to exercise due care and sells liquor to a minor, it is responsible for all proximately caused injuries.\u201d"
