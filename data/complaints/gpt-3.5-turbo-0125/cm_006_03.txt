vs.

Mark Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against Defendant, Mark Johnson, states as follows:

1. The Parties: The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and the Defendant, Mark Johnson, are the parents of two minor children: Emily Johnson, born on [DOB], and Lucas Johnson, born on [DOB].

2. Background:

A. On March 15, 2021, a custody order was entered by this Court granting primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and providing the Defendant with alternate weekends and one midweek visitation.

B. At the time of the original custody order, neither party was in a serious relationship, and the order did not address the presence of new partners during visitation.

3. Material Change in Circumstances:

A. The Plaintiff avers that there has been a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the current custody order. Specifically, the Defendant now resides with an individual who has a criminal record for assault and battery and was subject to a restraining order from a previous partner.

B. The Plaintiff has received reports from the minor children that this new partner engages in volatile and concerning behavior, including yelling, slamming doors, and physical aggression towards the children, such as grabbing one child with enough force to leave a visible mark on their arm.

C. Additionally, a neighbor contacted law enforcement during a loud argument at the Defendant's residence while the children were present, raising further concerns about the safety and well-being of the children during visitation.

4. Legal Argument:

A. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28 provides that custody orders may be modified upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances.

B. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the primary consideration in custody matters is the best interests of the child. See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002); Ross v. Ross, 385 Mass. 30 (1982).

C. Further, the presence of individuals with known histories of violence and aggression in close proximity to the children has been deemed detrimental to the children's well-being by the Massachusetts courts. See Department of Soc. Servs. v. Ziemba, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 498 (2009); Heistand v. Heistand, 384 Mass. 20 (1981).

5. Requested Relief:

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to either prohibit the presence of the Defendant's current partner during visitation with the minor children or order that all visits be supervised to ensure the safety and well-being of the children.

Respectfully submitted,
