IN THE WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT
[Your Name], Plaintiff

v.

Michael Thompson, Defendant.
Docket No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff [Your Name], and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson, alleges and states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff [Your Name] is an individual residing at 252 Elm St, Worcester, MA 01605.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is the landlord of the aforementioned property and is subject to suit in this jurisdiction.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction over this matter is proper in the Worcester District Court as the subject matter of this action arose within Worcester County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant on January 15, 2022, for the premises located at 252 Elm St, Worcester, MA 01605.

5. Since approximately three months ago, Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of a persistent and unresolved rodent infestation issue in the rented premises, specifically in the kitchen, evidenced by the ongoing presence of mouse droppings.

6. Defendant's response to the rodent infestation has been insufficient, as he merely placed a few traps and arranged for a single visit by an exterminator, despite the exterminator's recommendation of a more comprehensive treatment.

7. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $280 in damages due to the ongoing rodent infestation, including the cost of discarded food items ($200) and the purchase of plastic containers ($80) to prevent further contamination.

8. The rodent infestation and Defendant's failure to adequately address it have significantly disrupted Plaintiff's ability to use and enjoy the rented premises, causing ongoing anxiety and distress.

CAUSE OF ACTION

9. Defendant's failure to effectively address the rodent infestation in the rented premises constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as provided for under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff [Your Name] requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Find Defendant in breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $280;
c. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper; and
d. Award Plaintiff the costs and fees associated with this action.

Respectfully submitted,
