3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court, Lowell Division, as the incident giving rise to this action occurred at the above-mentioned address in Lowell, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at the aforementioned location, Plaintiff Emily Carter was lawfully present in the HomeGoods Superstore browsing the kitchen appliances section.

6. The Defendant, HomeGoods Superstore, LLC, negligently stacked heavy boxes of appliances on shelves without proper safety precautions, such as straps or barriers, to secure the items.
