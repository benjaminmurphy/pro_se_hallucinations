v.
Michael Sanders, Defendant
Docket No.:

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, hereby brings this Complaint seeking a modification of the existing custody order.

II. PARTIES

2. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of [Your City], [Your State].

3. Defendant, Michael Sanders, is a resident of [His City], [His State].

4. The parties are the parents of two minor children: Liam Thompson, born on [Liam's Date of Birth], and Ava Thompson, born on [Ava's Date of Birth].

III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 15, 2021, the Probate and Family Court entered a custody order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children and providing the Defendant with alternate weekends and one midweek visitation.

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, a material change in circumstances has occurred. The Defendant now resides with an individual who has a documented history of violent behavior, including a criminal record for assault and battery and a previous restraining order from a former partner.

7. The children have reported to the Plaintiff that the individual residing with the Defendant exhibits hostile behavior, including yelling, slamming doors, and physically aggressive actions towards them. One of the children was physically grabbed by this individual, leaving a visible mark on their arm.

8. Moreover, a neighbor reported an incident to the police involving a loud argument at the Defendant's residence while the children were present.

IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

9. In light of the above-mentioned material change in circumstances, Plaintiff requests that the existing custody order be modified to either prohibit the individual with the criminal record from being present during the Defendant's visitation periods or to require that all visitation be supervised in order to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor children.

V. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which provides jurisdiction to modify child custody orders.

VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

11. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order in the manner requested above for the protection and best interest of the minor children.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson prays for relief as follows:

1. Modify the existing custody order to prohibit the individual with a criminal record from being present during the Defendant's visitation periods or require supervised visitation; and
2. Grant such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025
