1. Parties

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1 This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and falls within the jurisdiction of the Chelsea District Court.
2.2 Venue is proper within this Court as the subject property is located in Chelsea, MA.

3. Facts
3.1 Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement to rent an apartment at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, MA 02150 from Defendant beginning on June 1, 2022, and pays monthly rent in the amount of $1500.
3.2 On or about two months ago, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the main entry door to the building had a broken lock that did not latch properly, leaving the building accessible to unauthorized individuals.
3.3 Despite assurances from Defendant that the lock would be fixed, no action has been taken to remedy the situation after subsequent reminders from Plaintiff.
3.4 As a result of the defective lock, unauthorized individuals gained access to the building, leading to the theft of packages from the hallway, including a package valued at $120 belonging to Plaintiff.
3.5 Plaintiff has also discovered evidence suggesting that unauthorized individuals have been sleeping in the building's basement, causing distress and concern for Plaintiff's safety.
3.6 Plaintiff, for her own protection, purchased a security camera and a better deadbolt for her door at a cost of approximately $200.
3.7 Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff's concerns as unwarranted, despite the clear security risks evident from the unaddressed maintenance issues.

4. Causes of Action
4.1 Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment: Defendant's failure to maintain the security of the building's main entry door, leading to unauthorized access and theft, as well as allowing unauthorized individuals to occupy the premises, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease agreement.

5. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
5.1 Award damages of $320 to Plaintiff for losses incurred due to Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
