IN THE BOSTON HOUSING COURT

OLIVIA MARTINEZ,
Plaintiff

v.

JAMES HOUGHTON,
Defendant

Case No.: [to be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Olivia Martinez, by and through undersigned counsel, and files this Complaint against the Defendant, James Houghton, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Olivia Martinez, is an individual residing at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. The Defendant, James Houghton, is the landlord of the above-mentioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 185C, Section 19, which grants jurisdiction over residential matters, including disputes between landlords and tenants.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On February 1, 2023, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

5. During the showing of the apartment, the Defendant assured the Plaintiff that water stains on the ceiling were from a previous leak that had been "totally fixed.”

6. Despite this assurance, upon the occurrence of the first significant rainstorm, water began dripping through the same spot on the ceiling.

7. The Plaintiff promptly notified the Defendant of the ongoing issue, which the Defendant dismissively referred to as a "minor cosmetic issue."

8. Subsequent rainstorms exacerbated the leakage, causing damage to the Plaintiff's personal property, including her couch and laptop.

9. The Plaintiff estimates that she has incurred approximately $900 in damages due to the Defendant's failure to address the persistent water leakage.

10. In addition to property damage, the ongoing moisture issue has resulted in a musty smell and potential mold growth in the apartment, leading to health concerns for the Plaintiff.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. The Defendant's failure to properly address and rectify the water leakage issue constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant for damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $900;

b. Order injunctive relief requiring the Defendant to promptly and effectively remediate the water leakage issue;

c. Award the Plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 22; and

d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
