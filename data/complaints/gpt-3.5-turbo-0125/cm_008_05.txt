Jessica Martin
Plaintiff

v.

David Thompson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, is a resident of [Your City], [Your State].

2. The Defendant, David Thompson, is a resident of [Defendant's City], [Defendant's State].

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On April 15, 2022, this Honorable Court entered a judgment establishing custody arrangements between the parties, granting joint legal custody with Jessica as the primary residential parent and providing David with substantial weekend time, including Sunday night overnights, with the parties' minor child, Emily Thompson, who is currently 10 years old.

4. Since the entry of the original custody order, significant issues regarding Emily's school attendance and academic performance have arisen.

5. Over the past year, the Defendant, David Thompson, has unilaterally kept Emily home from school on Mondays following their weekend visits, citing the need for a "mental health day." These absences have not been substantiated by medical documentation.

6. The Plaintiff has received truancy warnings from the school as a result of Emily's frequent absences on Mondays and has observed a decline in her academic performance, including lower grades and test scores.

7. Additionally, the Defendant has regularly failed to facilitate Emily's attendance at tutoring sessions that fall during his weekend visitation time, further impacting her academic progress.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

8. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to either grant her final decision-making authority regarding school attendance decisions or to reduce the Defendant's school-night overnight time with Emily, in the best interests of the minor child's academic well-being.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the custody order to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority on school attendance matters; or
b. Alternatively, modify the custody order to reduce the Defendant's school-night overnight visitation with the minor child, Emily.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]

Jessica Martin, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025
