Rebecca Collins
Plaintiff

v.

Tom Collins
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Tom Collins, alleges as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].
1.2. The Defendant, Tom Collins, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1. This action is filed in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, which has jurisdiction over matters concerning the modification of custody orders.
2.2. The court venue is appropriate as the parties' minor child, Max Collins, resides within this jurisdiction.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1. On November 15, 2019, a custody order was entered by this Honorable Court granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, Max Collins, while the Defendant was granted three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon, with no overnights.
3.2. Since the entry of the custody order, circumstances have materially changed. Max Collins, now eight years old, is in full-time school and has requested overnight stays at his father's residence, where he now has his own bedroom.
3.3. The current custody arrangement no longer serves Max's best interests. The constant back-and-forth between households during the school week disrupts his homework and bedtime routines, causing undue stress on Max and the parties.
3.4. Both parties, Plaintiff and Defendant, agree that the custody schedule should be modified to better accommodate Max’s age, school commitments, and preference for overnight stays at his father's residence.

4. Requested Modification
4.1. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to allow for a revised parenting schedule that includes overnights at the Defendant's residence on designated days during the school week, in accordance with Max's preferences and best interests.

5. Legal Basis
5.1. Modification of a custody order is warranted when there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child. The Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, provide the court with the authority to modify custody orders based on the best interests of the child.
5.2. Relevant case law, including but not limited to Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002), emphasize that the primary consideration in custody matters is the child's best interests, taking into account their age, needs, and preferences.
5.3. Additionally, the case of Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 469 Mass. 690 (2014), highlights the importance of a child's evolving needs as they grow older, supporting the modification of custody orders to reflect changing circumstances.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
1. Modify the existing custody order to allow for a revised parenting schedule as outlined in this Complaint;
2. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Date: December 1, 2025
