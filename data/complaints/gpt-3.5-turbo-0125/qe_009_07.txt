**Alicia Thompson**  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**Mark Jensen**  
Defendant  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

**Parties:**

1. Plaintiff, Alicia Thompson, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103.  
2. Defendant, Mark Jensen, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.  

**Jurisdiction and Venue:**

3. This action is brought in the Housing Court Department, Western Division, Springfield, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 185C, Section 3.  

**Factual Allegations:**

4. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on January 15, 2022, to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103, for a monthly rent of $1200.  
5. Since approximately October 20, 2025, Plaintiff has been without electricity in one of the bedrooms due to faulty wiring. The outlets in the room do not function, and the overhead light does not work.  
6. Despite Defendant sending an electrician who identified the need for significant repairs, Defendant has failed to promptly address the issue, citing complications with the building's old wiring.  
7. As a result, Plaintiff has been unable to utilize the affected bedroom as a home office, incurring additional expenses by working from coffee shops at an approximate cost of $15 per day, as well as maintaining a coworking space membership at $150 per month.  
8. The lack of access to the bedroom has forced Plaintiff to cram office supplies into the living room, significantly disrupting her living conditions and diminishing the habitability of the apartment.  

**Claim for Relief:**

9. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed by Massachusetts law, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.  

**Prayer for Relief:**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
2. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $900 as compensation for additional expenses incurred and diminished living conditions.  
3. Order Defendant to promptly rectify the electrical issues in the bedroom.  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**Respectfully submitted on this 1st day of December, 2025.**
