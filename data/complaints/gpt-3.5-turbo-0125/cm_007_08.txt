COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES, Laura Thompson, the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, and for her Complaint for Modification against James Thompson, the Defendant, alleges as follows:

[Parties]

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, resides at [insert address], a party to the original custody order entered on May 15, 2018, in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

2. The Defendant, James Thompson, resides at [insert address], is also a party to the original custody order entered on May 15, 2018, in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

[Jurisdiction and Venue]

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 208, section 28, governing the modification of custody orders.

4. Venue is proper in Bristol County as the original custody order was entered in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

[Factual Allegations]

5. On May 15, 2018, a custody order was entered by this Honorable Court granting the parties, Laura Thompson and James Thompson, 50/50 physical custody of their minor child, Emily Thompson, with alternating weeks.

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, a significant change in circumstances has occurred warranting a modification of the custody arrangement. The Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that impairs their physical abilities. This condition has led to the Defendant experiencing multiple falls and an inability to safely care for the minor child in certain situations.

7. As a result of the Defendant's condition, the Plaintiff has observed instances where the Defendant has had to rely on their twelve-year-old daughter, Emily Thompson, for physical assistance, including helping the Defendant move from a wheelchair to bed and bringing them items. This places an undue and unsafe burden on the minor child.

[Requested Relief]

8. The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody arrangement to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child, Emily Thompson. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests a modification to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, with appropriate visitation schedule for the Defendant that aligns with the Defendant's physical limitations.

[Legal Basis]

9. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 208, section 28, a court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child.

10. Case law, including but not limited to Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) and Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 159 (2006), supports the granting of a modification to custody orders where there has been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare.

11. It is well-established that the best interests of the child are paramount in custody matters, as held in numerous cases such as Custody of Vaillancourt, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 211 (1995) and Department of Children and Families v. N.D., 474 Mass. 630 (2016).

[Conclusion]

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the existing custody arrangement in a manner consistent with the best interests of the minor child, Emily Thompson, and grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
