Jessica Taylor,
Plaintiff,

v.

Mark Johnson,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION
(Docket No. [to be assigned])

COMES NOW, Jessica Taylor ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against Mark Johnson ("Defendant"), states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. Defendant, Mark Johnson, is an adult individual residing at [His Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

3. The minor child subject to this Complaint is Daniel Johnson, who is 8 years old.

INFRINGEMENT

4. The previous custody order was entered by this Honorable Court on September 15, 2018. The preceding arrangement granted primary physical custody to Plaintiff with Defendant granted three visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon, with no overnights.

5. Subsequent to the original custody order, there exists a substantial and material change in circumstances that warrants a modification to the existing arrangement based on the child's age and needs. These changes include, but are not limited to the child's schooling, age, development, and preference for overnights at Defendant's new residence, which now offers a suitable and stable environment for the child.

6. Plaintiff and Defendant both recognize the need for a revised schedule that better aligns with the child's age, school life demands, and overall well-being.

REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the current custody arrangement to include overnights at Defendant's new residence to align with the child's best interests.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
