Rachel Smith, Plaintiff
v.
James Smith, Defendant

Docket No. [To be assigned by the Court]

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Rachel Smith, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, James Smith, alleges and states as follows:

1. The parties, Rachel Smith (Plaintiff) and James Smith (Defendant), are the parents of two minor children, Emily Smith (age 8) and Noah Smith (age 6).

2. The original custody order governing the custody and visitation arrangement for the minor children was entered on April 15, 2021, establishing that Rachel has primary custody while James was granted visitation every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

3. It is now being sought for a modification of the abovementioned custody arrangement due to a substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the minor children.

4. The primary factor necessitating modification is a significant change in James Smith's work schedule. James recently commenced a new job that requires him to work from 7 PM to 7 AM multiple nights per week, including scheduled overnight visitations with the minor children. As a result, he has been increasingly unable to fulfill his parenting responsibilities during the agreed-upon overnight visits. Often, James has been dropping off Emily and Noah at Rachel's residence with minimal notice, or alternatively leaving the children in the care of a roommate, thereby exposing the children to inadequate supervision and care.

5. The children inform Rachel that they are left unattended, falling asleep on the couch while James recuperates from his work shift. Such actions by James, necessitated by his challenging work schedule, constitute a material change in circumstances that render the current custody arrangement no longer in the best interests of the children.

6. Rachel seeks a modification to the existing custody order to ensure that overnight visitations with James only occur when he is available and fully capable of providing appropriate care and supervision to Emily and Noah. Such modification is critical to safeguard the welfare and stability of the minor children.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Smith, respectfully requests this Honorable Court to enter an order modifying the existing custody arrangement in the best interests of the minor children. The Plaintiff further prays for any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.
