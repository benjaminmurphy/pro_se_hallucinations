Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff v. Michael Smith, Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, individually, and for her Complaint against Defendant, Michael Smith, alleges and states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of [Your City], [Your State].

2. Defendant, Michael Smith, is a resident of [Defendant's City], [Defendant's State].

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On May 15, 2021, this Honorable Court entered an Order granting Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children Emma Smith (8 years old) and Liam Smith (6 years old), and granting Defendant Michael Smith visitation rights on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

4. A material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody Order. Specifically, Defendant now cohabitates with an individual who has a criminal record for assault and battery, along with a history of domestic violence as evidenced by a restraining order obtained by a previous partner.

5. The children have reported instances of concerning behavior by the individual with whom Defendant cohabitates, including yelling, door slamming, and physical aggression towards them. On one occasion, the individual left a visible mark on one of the children's arm after grabbing them forcefully.

6. Additionally, a concerned neighbor contacted the police during a loud argument at Defendant's residence while the children were present, further highlighting the unsafe environment to which the children are exposed.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

7. In light of the above, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court modify the existing custody Order to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor children.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the existing custody Order to prohibit the presence of the individual with the criminal record during Defendant's visitation with the minor children; or
b. Alternatively, order that all visitation between Defendant and the minor children be supervised.

Plaintiff requests such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
