IN THE BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT
DORCHESTER DIVISION

JASMINE CARTER
Plaintiff

v.

MICHAEL THOMPSON
Defendant

CASE NO.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jasmine Carter (“Plaintiff”), by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jasmine Carter is an individual residing at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is the landlord of the aforementioned property located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the claim arises under the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, as the property in question is located in Dorchester, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

6. Since the commencement of the lease, Plaintiff has experienced ongoing issues with the heating system in the rented premises. The heating system has repeatedly malfunctioned, resulting in temperatures dropping to as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit inside the apartment.

7. Defendant sent repair personnel to address the heating issues on two separate occasions. The repairs temporarily resolved the problem, but it recurred shortly thereafter. The second repair technician noted that the boiler was old but functional, indicating limited options for further repairs.

8. Due to the inadequate heating, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain a livable temperature in the apartment. This resulted in an increase in Plaintiff's monthly electric bill by approximately $150.

9. Moreover, as a direct result of the cold indoor temperatures caused by the malfunctioning heating system, Plaintiff contracted bronchitis in January, which required medical treatment, including missed workdays and expenses for antibiotics.

10. Despite attempts to address the heating issues with Defendant, Plaintiff continues to endure substandard living conditions due to the recurring heating problems.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Massachusetts law guarantees tenants the right to quiet enjoyment of their rental premises, including the implied warranty of habitability and the right to a properly functioning heating system.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jasmine Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

(a) Declaring that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
(b) Awarding Plaintiff damages in the amount of $1450, representing costs incurred due to the inadequate heating and related health issues;
(c) Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025
