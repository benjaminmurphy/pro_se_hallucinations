The SJC ultimately holds that the Commonwealth\u2019s conduct, while arguably negligent, did not rise to recklessness, and it analogizes to other premises cases only to illustrate the recklessness threshold. It therefore does not establish or affirm any general rule about landlord liability for negligence in maintaining premises.",

L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, for the MDC\u2019s inaction. \u2026 The level of fault in this case, measured by the degree of risk of serious injury, is more consistent with our cases in which we have held that the evidence did not warrant a finding of wanton or reckless conduct.\u201d"

The court\u2019s analysis is framed entirely in terms of tavern keeper liability, statutory duties under the liquor laws, and foreseeability of harm to highway travelers, not duties owed to tenants or persons in a tenant-like relationship. Thus, citing Cimino for a general \u2018duty to protect tenants from foreseeable harm\u2019 misstates its holding and context.",
