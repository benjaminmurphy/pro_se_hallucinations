Emily Johnson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

I. Parties

1. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip].

2. Defendant, Michael Johnson, is an adult individual residing at [His Address], [City, State, Zip].

3. The child subject to this action is Sophia Johnson, age 10.

II. Factual Allegations

4. On May 15, 2016, this Honorable Court entered a custody order granting primary residence to the Defendant and awarding limited weekend visitations and one weeknight dinner to the Plaintiff based on her circumstances at the time.

5. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, was then in graduate school, living in a small studio apartment, and had limited flexibility in her schedule. These factors informed the original custody arrangement.

6. Since the entry of the initial custody order, Plaintiff has completed her education, secured stable employment with regular hours, and now resides in a more spacious two-bedroom apartment where Sophia has her own room.

7. Plaintiff and Sophia have developed a strong and close bond over the years. Sophia's therapist has noted her desire for increased time with her mother, expressing feelings of guilt upon leaving after short visits with Plaintiff.

8. Sophia, recognizing her own feelings and desires, has written a letter to this Court expressing her wish for more overnights with Plaintiff.

9. Defendant, Michael Johnson, has been uncooperative and hostile towards modifying the current custody arrangement, creating tension when Sophia attempts to broach the subject with him.

III. Requested Modification

10. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to modify the existing custody order to increase the amount of time Sophia spends with her, including additional overnights and extended visitation periods, in consideration of the changed circumstances and the best interests of the child.

IV. Legal Basis and Authority

11. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, this Court has jurisdiction to modify child custody orders based on a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.

12. Relevant case law supports the proposition that a child's preference, especially when expressed maturely and with reasons, can be a significant factor in custody modification proceedings. (See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Baccanti v. Morton, 434 Mass. 787 (2001); Schutzbank v. Holster, 376 Mass. 652 (1978)).

13. It is well established that a child's emotional well-being and the quality of their relationship with each parent are paramount considerations in determining custody arrangements. (See Ross v. Ross, 385 Mass. 30 (1982); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); Care & Protection of Laura, 414 Mass. 788 (1993)).

14. Principles of equity and the overarching goal of promoting the best interests of the child support the modification sought in this case. (See Moriarty v. Stone, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 151 (1996); Charara v. Yono, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 603 (2013)).

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests this Honorable Court to grant the requested modification of the custody order in the best interests of the child.

Date: December 1, 2025
