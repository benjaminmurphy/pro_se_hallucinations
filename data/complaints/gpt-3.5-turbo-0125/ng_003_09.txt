Plaintiff

v.

Bargain Home Goods, Inc.
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Julia Thompson, is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City], Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Bargain Home Goods, Inc., is a corporation conducting business at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On July 15, 2023, at the premises of Bargain Home Goods, Inc. located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises as a customer.

4. While Plaintiff was browsing in the kitchen appliance aisle, Defendant had negligently stacked heavy boxes of appliances several layers high on shelves without proper safety measures, such as straps or barriers.

5. Another customer, while maneuvering a cart down the aisle, inadvertently bumped into a lower shelf, causing a box containing a toaster-oven to fall from near the top of the stacked boxes, directly onto Plaintiff's shoulder and head.

6. Plaintiff immediately suffered dizziness and a severe headache as a result of the impact. Despite receiving an incident report completed by the store manager and a store coupon as a gesture of remedy, Plaintiff's injuries worsened, leading to a diagnosis of a mild concussion and shoulder strain by medical professionals at the emergency room.

7. Consequently, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,800 in medical expenses and lost about $600 in wages due to missed work as a delivery driver and inability to participate in weekly soccer activities for about a month.

CAUSES OF ACTION

8. Defendant owed a duty to maintain the premises in a safe condition for customers.

9. Defendant breached its duty of care by negligently stacking heavy boxes of appliances without proper safety precautions, leading to the injuries sustained by Plaintiff.

10. Defendant's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for compensatory damages in the amount of $2,400, plus any additional amounts proven at trial;

B. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award Plaintiff all costs and expenses incurred in this action; and

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
