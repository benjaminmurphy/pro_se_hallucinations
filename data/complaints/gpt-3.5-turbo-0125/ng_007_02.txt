Brockton Community Center
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Kyle Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Kyle Johnson, is a resident of Brockton, Massachusetts, and may be served at [Plaintiff's Address].

2. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a business entity located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, MA 02302.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21.

4. Venue is proper in this Judicial District where the incident occurred and where the Defendant conducts business.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at the Defendant's premises located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, MA 02302, the Plaintiff's minor child, while attending the after-school program supervised by the Defendant, sustained injuries as a result of the Defendant's negligence.

6. Despite advertising supervision of children at all times in the gym, on the aforementioned date, one of the staff members responsible for supervising a group of around twenty children left the gym to perform paperwork in the office.

7. The remaining staff member, instead of actively supervising the children, was distracted by usage of a personal mobile device, neglecting to monitor the activities of the children closely.

8. Two older children, approximately twelve years of age, engaged in a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor within the gym, creating a dangerous environment.

9. Several children, including the Plaintiff's minor child, informed the staff member of the risky behavior, but the staff member disregarded the warnings by making a dismissive comment of "boys will be boys."

10. Consequently, during the unsupervised play, the Plaintiff's eight-year-old child, due to his small stature, was forcefully tackled by one of the older children, resulting in the Plaintiff's child hitting his head on the floor and losing consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.

11. The Plaintiff's child suffered a concussion due to the negligent supervision provided by the Defendant, requiring emergency medical treatment, missing school days, incurring medical expenses of approximately $5,500, and resulting in lost wages for the Plaintiff.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff's child and other children attending the after-school program to provide adequate supervision and maintain a safe environment during their activities.

13. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to adequately supervise the children, specifically in allowing older children to engage in rough play, despite being made aware of the situation.

14. The Defendant's breach of duty was the proximate cause of the injuries sustained by the Plaintiff's child, including a concussion.

15. The Defendant's negligence constitutes a violation of the standard of care owed to the Plaintiff's child, as established under Massachusetts negligence law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Kyle Johnson, respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, for:

   a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $5,500 for medical expenses and $0 for lost wages;
   b. Costs and attorney's fees incurred in this action; and
   c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all triable issues.

Respectfully submitted,
