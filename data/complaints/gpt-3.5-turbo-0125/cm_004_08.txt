MIDDLESEX COUNTY

EMILY JOHNSON, Plaintiff

v.

MICHAEL SMITH, Defendant

Docket No.:

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, EMILY JOHNSON, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, MICHAEL SMITH, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, EMILY JOHNSON, is a resident of [Your City], [Your State].

2. The Defendant, MICHAEL SMITH, is a resident of [His City], [His State].

3. The parties are the parents of Liam Smith, an eight-year-old child born on [Liam's DOB].

JURISDICTION

4. This Complaint seeks modification of a custody order previously entered by this Honorable Court on March 15, 2018. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, this Court has jurisdiction over this matter.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. The original custody order granted primary physical custody of Liam Smith to the Plaintiff, EMILY JOHNSON, with the Defendant, MICHAEL SMITH, having three short visits during the week and Sunday afternoons, without overnights.

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, there have been significant changes in circumstances affecting the best interests of Liam Smith.

7. The current custody arrangement is no longer in the best interests of Liam Smith, now eight years old, who is attending school full time and has been requesting overnight visits at his father's home.

8. The Defendant, MICHAEL SMITH, now has his own apartment with adequate space and a separate bedroom for Liam, making overnight visits feasible and conducive to Liam's well-being.

9. The current custody schedule, involving frequent weekday exchanges and limited time for uninterrupted parenting, impedes Liam's homework and bedtime routines, causing undue stress on the child and affecting his academic performance and overall well-being.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

10. The Plaintiff, EMILY JOHNSON, respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to grant shared physical custody with overnights to the Defendant, MICHAEL SMITH, in the best interests of Liam Smith.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, EMILY JOHNSON, prays for relief as follows:

a. Modify the existing custody order to grant shared physical custody with overnights to the Defendant, MICHAEL SMITH;
b. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
