SUPERIOR COURT DEPARTMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT

HOUSING COURT DEPARTMENT

BOSTON DIVISION

Jordan Mitchell,

Plaintiff,

v.

Lily Anderson,

Defendant.

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell, and for his Complaint against Defendant, Lily Anderson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. Defendant, Lily Anderson, is the landlord of the aforementioned premises.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, which guarantees the covenant of quiet enjoyment to tenants.

4. Venue is proper in the Housing Court Department, Boston Municipal Court, where the subject premises are located.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for rental of the basement unit at 123 Maple Street on March 1, 2022.

6. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying rent due to unforeseen medical bills. He subsequently paid the rent in full, including any applicable late fees.

7. In November 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of water seepage issues in the basement unit during heavy rainfalls. Defendant acknowledged the issue but failed to take prompt and adequate action to address the water intrusion.

8. Subsequently, a city inspection revealed various code violations, including the water seepage issue in the basement unit.

9. The water seepage resulted in damage to Plaintiff's personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, estimated at $400. Plaintiff has also incurred additional expenses due to increased electricity usage for a dehumidifier necessitated by the water issue.

10. Despite Plaintiff's complaints being reasonable and established by the subsequent city inspection, Defendant has threatened not to renew Plaintiff's lease, citing the late rent payment as the primary justification.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. The failure to timely address and rectify the water seepage issue in the basement unit, leading to property damage and ongoing inconvenience, constitutes a breach of Defendant's obligation to provide quiet enjoyment of the premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for damages in the amount of $400;

b. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and equitable in the circumstances; and

c. Award Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in bringing this action.

Respectfully submitted,
