Docket No. [Insert Docket Number]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, and files this Complaint for Modification of the custody order entered on May 15, 2018, before this Honorable Court, and states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, is a resident of [Your City], Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Reynolds, is also a resident of [Your City], Massachusetts.

3. The minor child subject to this action is Ethan Reynolds, currently 8 years old.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 28, which governs jurisdiction in cases of custody and support.

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County as the minor child resides within its jurisdiction and the original custody order was issued by this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. The original custody order, entered on May 15, 2018, granted the Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, primary physical custody of Ethan Reynolds, with the Defendant, Michael Reynolds, having short visits during the week and on Sunday afternoons, with no overnights due to the Defendant's living situation at the time.

7. Since the issuance of the original order, significant changes have occurred that warrant a modification. Ethan Reynolds is now 8 years old, attends school full-time, and desires to have overnight visits at the Defendant's residence, where he now has his own bedroom.

8. The current custody arrangement, which involves frequent shuttling of Ethan between his parents' residences on school nights, is no longer in the best interest of the child. It interferes with his school, homework, and bedtime routines, causing unnecessary stress and disruption.

REQUESTED RELIEF

9. The Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to allow for overnight visits between Ethan Reynolds and the Defendant, Michael Reynolds, to better accommodate the child's age, school schedule, and preferences.

10. The Plaintiff further requests such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE

11. Pursuant to Massachusetts Supplemental Probate and Family Court Rule 410, the parties have attempted to reach an agreement regarding the modification of the custody order but have been unable to do so.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the requested modification of the custody order and any other relief that it deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Sophia Reynolds]
Sophia Reynolds, Plaintiff
