Jessica Harrington
Plaintiff,
v.
Michael Harrington
Defendant.

Complaint for Modification
Docket No. [To be assigned by the Court]

Comes now, the Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, by and through undersigned counsel, and files this Complaint for Modification pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, seeking a modification of the existing custody order dated April 15, 2018, currently in effect between the parties.

I. Jurisdiction and Venue

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the subject child resides in Bristol County and the original custody order was issued by this Court.

II. Parties

2. The Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, is a resident of [Plaintiff's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code], and can be reached at [Plaintiff's Phone Number] or [Plaintiff's Email Address].

3. The Defendant, Michael Harrington, is a resident of [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

4. The subject child of the parties is Sophie Harrington, born on [Child's Date of Birth].

III. Factual Allegations

5. The original custody order dated April 15, 2018, granted primary residence of Sophie Harrington to the Defendant, Michael Harrington, with limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner with the Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington.

6. Since the issuance of the original custody order, significant changes in circumstances have occurred, warranting a modification of the custody arrangement. Plaintiff has completed her education, obtained stable employment with normal hours, and now resides in a two-bedroom apartment suitable for the child, providing her a dedicated room.

7. The child's preference for increased time with the Plaintiff is evident in her expressed desire for more overnights at Plaintiff's residence, as supported by the child's therapist.

8. The Defendant has been uncooperative and resistant to any discussion regarding modifying the existing custody arrangement, displaying anger when the child expresses her wishes.

IV. Legal Basis

9. Modification of a custody order requires a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, as outlined in Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

10. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, establishes the statutory authority of the Court to modify custody orders based on a significant change in circumstances affecting the child's best interests.

V. Requested Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to grant increased parenting time to the Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, consistent with the child's expressed desire for more overnights and in consideration of the substantial and material changes in circumstances since the entry of the original order.

VI. Prayer for Relief

Plaintiff prays for the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to grant increased parenting time to the Plaintiff;
2. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,
