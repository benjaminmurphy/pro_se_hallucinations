COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, and for her Complaint for Modification against Defendant, Michael Turner, states as follows:

1. The Parties
1.1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, currently resides at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].
1.2. The Defendant, Michael Turner, currently resides at [Defendant's Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Factual Allegations
2.1. The parties are the parents of Emily Turner, born on [Child's Date of Birth], who is currently 12 years old.
2.2. Pursuant to a custody order issued by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2018, the parties were granted 50/50 physical custody of Emily Turner, with a week-on, week-off schedule.
2.3. Recent developments have rendered the existing custody arrangement untenable. Specifically, Defendant was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has severely impacted their physical abilities. Defendant's condition has led to a series of falls, prompting their physician to advise against Defendant being left alone with Emily Turner in settings requiring swift physical response.
2.4. Despite the medical advice, Defendant has continued to insist on maintaining the same 50/50 custody schedule.
2.5. Furthermore, Defendant has been relying on their 12-year-old child, Emily, to assist with their daily physical needs, creating an unsafe and inappropriate situation for the child.
2.6. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody arrangement to ensure Emily Turner's well-being and safety by primarily residing with Plaintiff while allowing Defendant time with Emily in a manner that aligns with Defendant's physical limitations.

3. Legal Basis for Modification
3.1. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Honorable Court may modify an existing custody order upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances that warrants a modification to serve the best interests of the child.
3.2. In the case of Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court emphasized the paramount importance of the child's best interests when considering custody modifications.
3.3. The principles established in Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002), confirm the necessity of revisiting custody arrangements when a parent's health condition significantly impacts their ability to care for the child.
3.4. Furthermore, in the case of Department of Children & Families v. Abigail, 480 Mass. 87 (2018), the court reaffirmed the obligation to ensure that the child's safety and well-being prevail in custody determinations.

4. Requested Relief
4.1. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of Emily Turner to Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, to ensure the child's safety and best interests are protected.
4.2. Plaintiff further requests that Defendant be granted reasonable visitation rights that are in line with Defendant's physical limitations and in consideration of Emily Turner's well-being.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court grant the relief as set forth above and provide such additional relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]

Jessica Turner, Plaintiff

Date: December 1, 2025
