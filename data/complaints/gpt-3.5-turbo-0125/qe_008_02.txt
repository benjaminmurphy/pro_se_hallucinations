COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Harrington, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas B. Mitchell, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the subject matter of the complaint arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
4. Venue is proper as the property in question is located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, MA 02150.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of an apartment at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, MA 02150.
6. Plaintiff pays Defendant $1500 per month in rent.
7. On a date approximately two months ago, Plaintiff informed Defendant of a broken lock on the main entry door to the building, which has not been properly fixed.
8. Despite multiple reminders by Plaintiff, Defendant has failed to rectify the broken lock issue.
9. Due to the broken lock, an individual gained unauthorized access to the building, resulting in the theft of packages from the hallway, including one belonging to Plaintiff valued at approximately $120.

13. The aforementioned circumstances have substantially interfered with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION

14. Plaintiff brings this action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law due to Defendant's failure to maintain a secure building and remedy security concerns after notice.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Harrington respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Award damages in the amount of $320, representing the value of the stolen package and security expenses incurred by Plaintiff.
2. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
