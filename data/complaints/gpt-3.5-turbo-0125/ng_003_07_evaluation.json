Thus, it supports the general proposition that the defendant owed a duty of care to maintain safe premises.",

A store owner has been required to maintain its property \u2018in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk.\u2019 Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973). \u2026 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343 (1965), states: \u2018A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if\u2026 [he] fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.\u2019\u201d}"
