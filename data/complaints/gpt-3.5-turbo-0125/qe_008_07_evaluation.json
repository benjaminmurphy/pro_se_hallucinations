It does not involve landlord-tenant law, covenants of quiet enjoyment, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, \u00a7 14, or any related housing issues.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.'\""

      "support_reasoning": "Puccio v. Marx is a condominium/common-area allocation case under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 183A; it concerns whether a by-law amendment granting exclusive use of common property altered percentage interests without unanimous consent. The opinion does not address landlord\u2013tenant law, residential tenancies, or the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, nor does it mention Erickson v. Whistler or analyze quiet enjoyment as a cause of action. Therefore it does not support the proposition about a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts landlord\u2013tenant law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe master deed, the condominium trust instrument, and G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 5, all require the unanimous consent of the unit owners for any change in the owners\u2019 percentage interest in the common areas. \u2026 The amendment therefore violated G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 5 (b), and the terms of the master deed and the condominium trust instrument. Under the master deed and the trust instrument, the amendment is invalid and has no effect.\u201d"
