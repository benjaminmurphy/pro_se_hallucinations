      "support_reasoning": "This excerpt is a concurring/dissenting opinion focused on implied warranty of habitability and the interdependence of rent and repair obligations, not on the covenant of quiet enjoyment. It does not analyze or define the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, nor does it ground tenant remedies in that covenant. While Hemingway as a whole is foundational on landlord-tenant obligations, this specific text does not support the claim that the defendant\u2019s actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implicit in every residential lease.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The second step required for the removal of the roadblock is the reversal of the present common law rule that the obligation of the tenant to pay rent and the obligation, if any, of the landlord to repair or maintain the rented premises are independent, and the substitution therefor of a new rule that such obligations are substantially mutually interdependent. The opinion of the court accomplishes this.\""

      "support_reasoning": "Alholm v. Wareham is a tort case about municipal liability and causation in a multicar highway accident; it does not involve landlord\u2011tenant law, leases, or the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The only arguably related passage is a footnote discussing municipal liability for public nuisance, which is not about residential leases or quiet enjoyment and is expressly not decided. Therefore, this case does not support the proposition that defendant\u2019s actions breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in a residential lease under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"This court has never been squarely confronted with the question whether municipalities may be held liable for injuries resulting from a public nuisance. It is well settled that a municipality is liable for injury resulting from its maintenance of a private nuisance... We can discern no valid reason why municipalities should not be liable for injuries resulting from their maintenance of public nuisances... However, we need not decide that question here.\""
