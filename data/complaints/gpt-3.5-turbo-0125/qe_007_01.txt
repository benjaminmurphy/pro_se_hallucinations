IN THE CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX, MASSACHUSETTS

AVERY JOHNSON, 
Plaintiff

v.

MARK THOMPSON,
Defendant.

Civil Action No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Avery Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Thompson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Avery Johnson is an individual residing at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who owns the residential premises located at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, where Plaintiff resides under a lease agreement.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in this district as the subject property is located within the jurisdiction of the Cambridge District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, commencing on May 1, 2022.

6. For the past two months, Defendant has engaged in ongoing renovations on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's residence. The construction activities, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers, have caused significant noise disruptions during weekdays from approximately 8 AM to 5 PM.

7. The noise from the construction has impeded Plaintiff's ability to work from home, causing disruptions during important calls and affecting concentration.

8. Additionally, dust from the construction has infiltrated Plaintiff's unit through the vents, further disrupting Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of the leased premises.

9. Despite Defendant's prior notice of the renovation project, the prolonged and ongoing nature of the construction activities has substantially interfered with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

10. Defendant's offer of a small rent reduction, approximately $100 for one month, does not adequately compensate Plaintiff for the extensive disruption and inconvenience caused by the ongoing construction activities.

CAUSE OF ACTION

11. Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implicit in every residential lease agreement under Massachusetts law, specifically defined in cases such as Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) and Alholm v. Wareham, 371 Mass. 621 (1976).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Damages in the amount of $800, representing the monetary loss and nuisance suffered by Plaintiff due to Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

2. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury of all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
