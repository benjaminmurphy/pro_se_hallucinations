Plaintiff

v.

Michael Johnson
Defendant

Civil Action No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, to file this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Johnson, and states as follows:

1. The Parties:
1.1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].
1.2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Factual Background:
2.1. On May 15, 2021, the Court entered a custody order establishing that Sarah Thompson has primary custody of the parties' minor child, Emma Johnson, while Michael Johnson has visitation on Wednesdays and every other weekend.
2.2. The current custody arrangement is based on the assumption that both parties reside in close proximity in the Cambridge area, allowing for the smooth implementation of the visitation schedule and the child's attendance at the local school.
2.3. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, now seeks to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while maintaining the existing visitation schedule without regard for the considerable distance and adverse effects on the well-being of the minor child.
2.4. The proposed relocation to New Hampshire would necessitate Emma Johnson to endure lengthy and stressful car rides, approximately ninety minutes each way, for midweek overnight visits, resulting in disruption to her daily routine, increased anxiety, and limitations on her extracurricular activities.
2.5. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, seeks a modification of the custody order to eliminate the midweek overnights and to adjust the weekend visitation schedule to better accommodate the changed circumstances due to the proposed relocation.

3. Requested Modification:
3.1. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnights with the Defendant and adjust the weekend visitation schedule to ensure that the best interests of the minor child, Emma Johnson, are served in light of the significant change in circumstances caused by the Defendant's relocation to New Hampshire.

4. Legal Basis:
4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, the Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances that warrants a modification in the best interests of the child.
4.2. In the landmark case of Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass.App.Ct. 257 (2001), the Court held that a proposed modification to a custody arrangement must be based on a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare.
4.3. Furthermore, in Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the Court established that any custody modification must be in the child’s best interests and address the current circumstances affecting the child’s well-being.
4.4. Additionally, under Gilmore v. Gilmore, 369 Mass. 598 (1976), the Court emphasized the importance of ensuring that the child's best interests are paramount in any custody modification proceeding.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully prays for the following relief:

1. Modification of the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnights with the Defendant.
2. Adjustment of the weekend visitation schedule to better accommodate the changed circumstances caused by the Defendant’s proposed relocation to New Hampshire.
3. Any other relief deemed just and equitable by the Court.

Respectfully submitted,
