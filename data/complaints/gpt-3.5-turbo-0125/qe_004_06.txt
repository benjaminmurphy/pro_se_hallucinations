v.

Michael Williams
Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Williams, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is a resident of 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604.

2. The Defendant, Michael Williams, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Annotated, Chapter 218, Section 19.

4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court as the Property subject to this action is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604 for $1200 per month.

6. Since approximately three months ago, Plaintiff has been facing a persistent and unsanitary rodent infestation issue within the rented premises, specifically in the kitchen, as evidenced by ongoing sightings of mouse droppings.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation and, in response, Defendant only minimally addressed the issue by setting a few traps and arranging for a singular pest control visit, which did not sufficiently resolve the infestation.

8. Despite Plaintiff's ongoing complaints about the continuous presence of mouse droppings, Defendant has failed to take further adequate actions to resolve the infestation, citing that minor infestations are normal in older buildings and asserting that continued infestation is due to Plaintiff's cleanliness habits.

9. The Plaintiff, in response to the ineffectiveness of Defendant’s limited pest control measures, has suffered financial damages amounting to approximately $280, including expenses related to discarded food items and purchase of storage containers.

CAUSES OF ACTION

10. Plaintiff asserts a single cause of action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts law, M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully prays for relief from this Honorable Court as follows:

1. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff for compensatory damages in the amount of $280.
2. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
