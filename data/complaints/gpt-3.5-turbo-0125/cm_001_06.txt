Laura Jenkins, Plaintiff
v.
Michael Jenkins, Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes Laura Jenkins, plaintiff herein, and for her Complaint for Modification against Michael Jenkins, defendant herein, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], Massachusetts.

2. The defendant, Michael Jenkins, is an adult individual residing at [His Address], [City], Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. The parties are the parents of two children, Sophie Jenkins (age 8) and Ethan Jenkins (age 6).

4. The original custody order was entered by this Court on May 15, 2020, establishing a parenting schedule where Laura Jenkins has custody with the children primarily living with her, and Michael Jenkins has custody every other weekend and one overnight each week.

5. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a significant change in circumstances regarding the defendant's work schedule, which now includes working from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week, including the nights he is supposed to have the children overnight.

6. The defendant has been dropping off the children at the plaintiff's residence with minimal notice, citing fatigue from work, and at times, leaving the children with a roommate of his whom the plaintiff is unfamiliar with.

7. The children have reported falling asleep on the couch while in the defendant's care, as he naps after returning home from work.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

8. The plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to ensure that overnights with the children only occur when the defendant is not working overnight shifts and is available to provide proper care and supervision.

STATUTORY AND CASELAW AUTHORITY

9. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify custody orders upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances. Additionally, relevant case law such as Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 532 Mass. 322 (2017), emphasizes the importance of the child's best interests in custody modification proceedings.

10. Other pertinent legal authorities include Greenwood v. Greenwood, 426 Mass. 336 (1998), and Baker v. Baker, 725 N.E.2d 84 (Mass. App. Ct. 2023), which support the modification of custody orders to ensure the children's well-being and safety.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the existing custody order to limit overnights with the children to times when the defendant is available and not working overnight shifts; and
b. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
