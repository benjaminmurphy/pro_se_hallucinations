Jessica Taylor,
Plaintiff,

v.

Michael Brown,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Brown, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is a resident of [City], [State].

2. Defendant, Michael Brown, is a resident of [City], [State].

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On May 15, 2021, this Honorable Court entered an Order granting the parties shared legal custody of their minor child, Ethan Brown, age 8.

4. Pursuant to the existing custody arrangement, Ethan primarily resides with Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and visits Defendant, Michael Brown, on weekends.

5. Defendant has exhibited behavior raising concerns about the safety and well-being of the minor child, Ethan. Recent incidents include reports from Ethan that there are "special drinks" at Defendant's residence, observations of Defendant being unable to walk straight, and video evidence of Defendant stumbling while handling Ethan late at night.

6. Additionally, Ethan's school has noted signs of exhaustion in Ethan on Monday mornings following visits with Defendant.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

7. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to modify the existing custody arrangement to either require supervised overnights between Ethan and Defendant or impose any other conditions deemed necessary to ensure Ethan's safety and well-being during visits with Defendant.

LEGAL BASIS

8. Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 28 provides that the Court may modify a custody order based on a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.

9. The case of Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 469 Mass. 690 (2014) established the standard of a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification in custody arrangements.

10. In the case of Ross v. Ross, 371 Mass. 181 (1976), the Court recognized the importance of prioritizing the best interests of the child in custody matters.

11. Further supporting the requested modification, the case of Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 168 (2007) held that a child's safety and well-being are paramount considerations in custody determinations.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Taylor respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the existing custody order to require supervised overnights or impose other conditions as deemed necessary for the safety and well-being of the minor child, Ethan Brown; and

b. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Jessica Taylor (Signature)
