4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court, Cambridge, MA, as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Market Street, Somerville, MA 2023-09-09.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On 2023-09-09, at approximately [Time], Plaintiff was lawfully present at FreshMart Grocery Store located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, MA, shopping in the dairy aisle.

6. While in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff slipped and fell on a puddle of spilled milk, sustaining a hip sprain as a result of the fall.

7. The puddle of spilled milk, of a size substantial enough to leave visible cart tracks, was not marked with any warning signs or cones alerting customers to the hazard. An employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away from the spill.

8. Despite the employee's knowledge of the spill "a few minutes ago," no action was taken to clean up the spill or warn customers of the dangerous condition.

As a result of the injury, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,500 in wages from missed shifts at her place of employment.

10. Defendant FreshMart Grocery Store owed a duty of care to Plaintiff and all customers to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees.

11. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk in the dairy aisle or place warning signs to alert customers of the hazardous condition.

12. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and economic losses.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and suffered other damages.
