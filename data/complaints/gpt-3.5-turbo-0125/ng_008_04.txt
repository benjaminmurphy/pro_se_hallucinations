Jessica Hartman
Plaintiff

v.

Quincy Bistro LLC
Defendant

CASE NO.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Hartman, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC is a business entity registered and operating in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal place of business located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 218, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum.

4. Venue is proper in Norfolk County as the cause of action arose within this county.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 10, 2023, at the premises of Quincy Bistro located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169, Plaintiff Jessica Hartman was a patron of the restaurant.

6. While dining at Quincy Bistro, a server working for the Defendant dropped a tray of water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.

7. Although the server promptly cleared the broken glass, she neglected to clean up or mark the spilled water and ice on the tile floor, stating she would return soon with a mop.

8. Approximately ten minutes following the incident, Plaintiff got up to use the restroom and unknowingly stepped on the wet tile hallway. Due to the unmarked wet floor, Plaintiff slipped and twisted her knee, sustaining a sprain.

9. Post-incident, it was revealed that other Quincy Bistro staff members were aware of the hazardous condition in the hallway but had not taken any remedial action.

10. As a direct result of the slip and fall incident, Plaintiff Jessica Hartman suffered a sprained knee that required medical treatment, including a brace and physical therapy.

CAUSES OF ACTION

11. Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC owed a duty of care to maintain safe premises for its patrons under the principles of common law negligence as recognized in Golston v. Boston Restaurant Associates, Inc., 409 Mass. 277 (1991).

12. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly remove the spilled water and ice, as well as neglecting to provide any warning signs or take appropriate actions to prevent harm to patrons, as required by law.

13. Defendant's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages, in violation of the standards set forth in Cimino v. Milford Keg, Inc., 385 Mass. 323 (1982).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hartman respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

a. Award compensatory damages in an amount to fully reimburse Plaintiff for her medical expenses, estimated at $2,500, and lost wages, estimated at $1,200;

b. Award any further damages deemed just and equitable by the Court;

c. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on any monetary award;

d. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action and reasonable attorney's fees; and

e. Grant such other and further relief as the Court may determine to be just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
