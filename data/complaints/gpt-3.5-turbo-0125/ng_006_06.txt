IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SUFFOLK COUNTY
----------------------------------
Jordan Thompson, Plaintiff

v.

Mark Williams, Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Thompson, by and through the undersigned attorney, and for his Complaint against Defendant Mark Williams, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Thompson, is a resident of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Mark Williams, is a rideshare driver and resident of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 1.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court as the actions giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 12, 2023, at approximately [add time], Plaintiff was riding his bicycle in a marked bike lane on 17th Street in Boston, Massachusetts, when Defendant, who was parked in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane, negligently opened his vehicle door without checking for oncoming traffic, causing Plaintiff to collide with the door and suffer injuries.

6. Despite Plaintiff's adherence to traffic rules, wearing a helmet, and being lawfully in the bike lane, Defendant Williams failed to exercise reasonable care and attention, resulting in the collision that caused Plaintiff to sustain road rash on his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth, as well as damage to his bicycle.

7. At the scene of the incident, Defendant admitted that he did not see Plaintiff because he was distracted by his phone, an act of negligence on his part.

8. Subsequently, when Plaintiff filed a claim with Defendant's insurance company for his injuries and damages, Defendant made false statements alleging that Plaintiff was weaving in and out of traffic, which is categorically untrue.

CAUSES OF ACTION

9. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's actions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law. Specifically, Defendant owed a duty of care to operate his vehicle safely, including checking for oncoming traffic before opening his vehicle door. Defendant breached this duty by failing to do so, causing the collision and resulting injuries to Plaintiff.

10. The negligence of Defendant was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages, including medical expenses totaling approximately $1,500, and lost wages totaling $800, as well as damage to Plaintiff's bicycle.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor against Defendant and order the following relief:

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial but estimated to be the sum of $2,300;
2. Prejudgment interest as allowed by law;
3. Costs and fees of suit; and
4. Any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted on this December 1, 2025.
