IN THE BERKSHIRE SUPERIOR COURT

EMILY CARTER,
Plaintiff,

v.

JOHN THOMPSON,
Defendant.

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff, Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, for her Complaint against Defendant John Thompson, alleges the following based on information and belief:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is a resident of Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, John Thompson, is a homeowner residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, and is the owner and possessor of the property where the incident giving rise to this action occurred.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of personal injuries suffered by Plaintiff due to the negligence of Defendant. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits, and the parties are residents of Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On August 12, 2023, at approximately [time of the incident], Plaintiff was walking on the sidewalk in front of Defendant's property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

5. Defendant was aware of a significant crack and droop in a large branch of a maple tree on his property that extended over the sidewalk. Despite being informed by neighbors to address the potentially hazardous situation, Defendant negligently failed to take any action to remedy the dangerous condition.

6. During a moderate summer thunderstorm on the aforementioned date, the cracked branch hanging over the sidewalk suddenly snapped and fell onto Plaintiff, striking her shoulder and back and causing her to fall to the ground.

7. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain, multiple bruises, and required medical treatment. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and suffered a loss of approximately $650 in wages due to missed work.

CAUSES OF ACTION

8. Plaintiff reasserts and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

9. Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain his property in a safe condition, including inspecting and addressing hazardous conditions such as the cracked branch hanging over the sidewalk.

10. Defendant breached this duty by failing to address the known dangerous condition and negligently allowing the branch to remain in a precarious state, eventually causing harm to Plaintiff.

11. Defendant's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant John Thompson for:

a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $1,850, plus interest;
b. Costs and expenses of this action; and
c. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
