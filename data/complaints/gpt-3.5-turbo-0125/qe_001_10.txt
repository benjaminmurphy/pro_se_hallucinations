Sarah Thompson, Plaintiff

v.

John Mitchell, Defendant

Civil Action No. ________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and hereby files this Complaint against the Defendant, John Mitchell, and in support thereof states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

2. The Defendant, John Mitchell, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships, specifically the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Ch. 218, Sec. 19 and Ch. 185C, Sec. 3.

5. Venue is proper in Boston Municipal Court as the subject property is located in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On January 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement to rent a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA 02124, from the Defendant for $1800 per month.

7. Since the commencement of the tenancy, the Plaintiff has experienced recurring issues with the heating system in the rented premises. Despite attempts by the Defendant to repair the heating system twice, the problem persists, resulting in inadequate heating during cold weather.

8. The heating issue has caused the indoor temperature to drop to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit for hours at a time, particularly in the evenings, forcing the Plaintiff to purchase two space heaters to maintain a livable temperature.

9. The Plaintiff incurred additional expenses amounting to approximately $150 per month in increased electricity bills due to the faulty heating system, for a total estimate of $600.

10. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of the cold indoor environment, the Plaintiff fell ill with bronchitis in January, requiring medical treatment and resulting in missed work days and expenses for antibiotics.

11. Despite the Defendant's assertion that the heating system was "working" as it did not completely fail, the persistent temperature fluctuations constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all Massachusetts residential leases.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. The Defendant's repeated failure to provide adequate heat in the leased premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

1. Damages in the amount of $600 for increased electricity costs incurred by the Plaintiff.
2. Damages for medical expenses, lost wages, and other costs associated with the Plaintiff's illness resulting from the inadequate heat.
3. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]
