DOCKET NO.: [CASE NUMBER]	

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Emily Robinson, and files this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, David Robinson, and in support thereof, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Robinson, is a resident of [City], Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, David Robinson, is a resident of [City], Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On May 15, 2022, a custody order was issued by this Honorable Court, granting shared legal custody of the parties' children, Liam (age 10) and Ava (age 8), with the children primarily residing with the Plaintiff.

4. The current custody arrangement involves the children primarily residing with the Plaintiff and the Defendant having scheduled visitation every other weekend.

5. Plaintiff alleges that a substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred since the issuance of the original custody order.

6. Plaintiff asserts that over the past year, the Defendant has been unilaterally enrolling the children in activities that conflict with the Plaintiff's scheduled parenting time without prior consultation, causing disruptions and confusion in the children's routine.

7. Additionally, the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant has made disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff to the children, including labeling the Plaintiff as "selfish" and implying that the Plaintiff does not love the children, leading to emotional distress within the children.

8. One of the children, Liam, has begun experiencing stress-related physical symptoms, specifically stomach aches, on transition days between the parents.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

9. In light of the substantial changes in circumstances observed, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of Liam and Ava to the Plaintiff, Emily Robinson, in the best interests of the children.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to:

a. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the children to the Plaintiff;
b. Establish clear guidelines regarding scheduling decisions and parental communication; and
c. Grant any further relief that this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
