IN THE CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT

Jessica Howard
Plaintiff

v.

Thomas Green
Defendant

COMPLAINT

Now comes Plaintiff, Jessica Howard, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas Green, hereby alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Howard is an individual residing at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138.

2. Defendant Thomas Green is the landlord of the property located at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21, as the subject matter of this action arises from a landlord-tenant dispute within the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court, as the property subject to this dispute is located in Cambridge, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138 for $2500 per month.

6. Beginning on [start date of construction], Defendant commenced construction and renovation work on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's, resulting in excessive noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations of workers, from 8 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.

7. The noise levels from the ongoing construction work have significantly disrupted Plaintiff's ability to work from home, particularly during calls, impacting her ability to concentrate and carry out her professional duties.

8. Furthermore, dust from the construction site has infiltrated Plaintiff's unit through the vents, causing additional inconvenience and discomfort.

9. While Defendant provided prior notice of the renovation, and the workers maintain reasonable working hours, the prolonged and ongoing disturbance has resulted in a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff as a tenant under Massachusetts law.

Plaintiff asserts a single cause of action against Defendant for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, based on the ongoing and excessive noise from construction, dust infiltration, and resultant interference with Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of the premises, in violation of Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws and applicable case law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Howard respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Award damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $3,000, representing compensation for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

b. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

c. Award Plaintiff the costs and disbursements of this action, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
