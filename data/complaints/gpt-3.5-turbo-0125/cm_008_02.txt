COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
MIDDLESEX, SS. PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
SUFFOLK DIVISION

EMMA THOMPSON, Plaintiff,
v.
DAVID MILLER, Defendant.
Docket No. [to be assigned]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes Emma Thompson, the Plaintiff in the above-captioned action, and for her Complaint for Modification against David Miller, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Emma Thompson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. Defendant, David Miller, is an adult individual residing at [Address of Defendant], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

3. The parties are the parents of Sophia Miller, a minor child born on [Sophia's Date of Birth].

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which grants jurisdiction over custody matters.

BACKGROUND

5. On May 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment establishing custody arrangements where the Plaintiff has primary residential custody, and the Defendant has substantial weekend visitation, including Sunday nights. The parties share legal custody and are obligated to cooperate on school matters.

6. Since the entry of the Judgment, a material change in circumstances has occurred concerning the welfare and best interests of the minor child, Sophia Miller.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Over the past year, the Defendant has regularly kept Sophia home from school on Mondays after their weekends together, citing the child's need for a "mental health day." No medical documentation supports these absences.

8. The school has issued truancy warnings due to these unauthorized absences, and Sophia's academic performance has markedly declined, evident through lowering grades and test scores.

9. Additionally, the Defendant consistently refuses to take Sophia to her tutoring sessions that coincide with his weekends, hindering her educational progress.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

10. The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to grant her final decision-making authority concerning school attendance decisions or alternatively, to reduce the Defendant's overnight visits on school nights.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Modify the custody order to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority on school attendance decisions; or
2. In the alternative, reduce the Defendant's overnight visitation on school nights.

Respectfully submitted,

Emma Thompson
