      "support_reasoning": "The opinion in Yannas v. Frondistou\u2011Yannas concerns an initial divorce judgment determining custody and a request to remove the children to Greece; it does not address the standard for *modifying* an existing custody order. The quoted pages discuss the \u2018best interests\u2019 and \u2018real advantage\u2019 standards for removal under G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, not the requirement of a \u2018substantial and material change in circumstances\u2019 to alter a prior custody judgment. Thus, the case is being cited for a modification principle it does not articulate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe Massachusetts removal statute, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 (1984 ed.), provides that \u2018[a] minor child of divorced parents who is a native of . . . this commonwealth . . . shall not, if of suitable age to signify his consent, be removed out of this commonwealth without such consent, or, if under that age, without the consent of both parents, unless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u2019 The words \u2018upon cause shown\u2019 mean only that removal must be in the best interests of the child (Rubin v. Rubin, 370 Mass. 857 [1976]; Hale v. Hale, supra at 815)\u2026\u201d}"
