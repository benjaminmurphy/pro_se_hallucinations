The defendant is the Commonwealth in a criminal case, not a business premises owner, and the court never discusses invitee status or maintenance of premises. Thus it cannot be cited as authority for a duty-of-care rule for business invitees.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The statutes applying to the petitioner\u2019s case which were in force when he committed the offences of which he was convicted are Pub. Sts. c. 222, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21, 22, and St. 1884, c. 152. \u2026 The petitioner contends that the effect of these differences may be to make the term of imprisonment longer than it would have been under the laws in force at the time the offences were committed, and to change his position in other respects to his disadvantage, and that therefore the statute is unconstitutional and void."
