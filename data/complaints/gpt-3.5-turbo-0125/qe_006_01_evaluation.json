Although the author dissents from the *formulation* of the majority\u2019s implied warranty (preferring a code\u2011based implied covenant), he concurs in the result that recognizes an implied obligation of habitability enforceable by tenants. Thus, the case as a whole clearly establishes the implied warranty of habitability under Massachusetts law, even if this opinion critiques its scope.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cI agree with the majority of the court that, at least as to dwelling units, the time has come to reconsider the rule so long imbedded in our law of landlord and tenant that \u2018[t]here is no implied agreement, apart from fraud, that the demised premises are or will continue to be fit for occupancy or safe and in good repair\u2026.\u2019 \u2026 The opinion of the court accomplishes [making the landlord\u2019s repair obligation and the tenant\u2019s rent obligation mutually interdependent].\u201d"
