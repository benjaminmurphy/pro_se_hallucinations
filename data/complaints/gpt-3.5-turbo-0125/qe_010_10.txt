IN THE LOWELL DISTRICT COURT

EMILY CARTER

Plaintiff,

v.

LAURA BENNETT

Defendant.

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Laura Bennett, alleges as follows:

PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. Defendant Laura Bennett is an individual who owns the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred within Lowell, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852, for a monthly rent of $1200.

5. Since the commencement of the lease, Plaintiff has experienced a severe mold infestation in the bathroom of the rented premises. The mold originated in the corner of the shower and has since spread to the ceiling due to inadequate ventilation in the bathroom.

6. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold issue and requested remediation. Defendant, after inspection, wrongfully attributed the cause of the mold to Plaintiff's alleged failure to use the exhaust fan adequately and taking hot showers of a normal frequency and duration.

7. Despite Defendant's acknowledgment of the existing mold, Defendant has failed to take appropriate actions to fully remediate the mold issue and enhance ventilation in the bathroom.

8. As a direct result of the mold infestation, Plaintiff has suffered physical health effects, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, necessitating medical treatment. Plaintiff's healthcare provider has linked these health issues to the mold exposure in the rental premises.

9. Additionally, Plaintiff has incurred damages estimated at $60 due to the need to discard moldy personal property, including a shower curtain and towels.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

10. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

11. Defendant's failure to address and rectify the mold infestation and inadequate ventilation in the rental premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease agreement under Massachusetts law.

12. The actions and inactions of Defendant have caused Plaintiff to endure physical discomfort and health issues, as well as financial losses due to damaged personal property.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests the following relief from this Court:

A. An Order directing Defendant to promptly and effectively remediate the mold infestation and enhance ventilation in the bathroom of the rental premises;

B. Compensatory damages in the amount of $300 for the value of personal property lost due to the mold infestation;

C. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
