Docket No. [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, David Smith, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts, residing at [Your Address], with contact information (phone number: (617) 555-0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com).

2. The Defendant, David Smith, is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On May 15, 2016, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered a custody order granting primary residence of the parties' minor child, Sophie Smith, aged 10, to the Defendant, David Smith. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, was awarded limited weekend visitation including one weeknight dinner.

4. The original custody order was based on Plaintiff's circumstances at the time, including her enrollment in graduate school, living in a small studio apartment, and having a limited schedule.

5. Since the entry of the original custody order, substantial changes in circumstances have occurred. The Plaintiff has completed her graduate studies, attained stable employment with regular hours, and now resides in a suitable two-bedroom apartment where Sophie has her own room.

6. Sophie and Plaintiff have developed a significantly close relationship over the years. Sophie's therapist has acknowledged that she feels guilt and emotional distress due to the limited visitation schedule with Plaintiff. Sophie has expressed a strong desire for increased time with Plaintiff and has even written a letter to the Court expressing her wishes.

7. Despite Sophie's expressed wishes and the significant changes in Plaintiff's circumstances, the Defendant, David Smith, has refused to engage in discussions regarding modification of the custody arrangement. He has shown resistance and anger when Sophie raises the topic.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

8. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to allow for an updated visitation schedule that enables Sophie to spend more time with Plaintiff, including additional overnights.

JURISDICTION

9. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which grants the Probate and Family Court the authority to modify prior custody orders upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances warranting such modification.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the relief sought and modify the existing custody order in accordance with the requested updated visitation schedule.

Respectfully submitted,
