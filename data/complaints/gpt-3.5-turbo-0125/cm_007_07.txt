COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Lara Chester, by and through undersigned counsel (if applicable), and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Chester, alleges as follows:

PARTIES
1. The Plaintiff, Lara Chester, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip].

2. The Defendant, Michael Chester, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip].

3. The minor child subject to the custody order is Samantha Chester, born on [Child's Date of Birth].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4. This action is filed in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court under the jurisdiction granted by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208 sections 28 and 28A.

5. Venue is proper in this Court as the child resides within Bristol County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6. On April 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order establishing a 50/50 physical custody arrangement, with the child, Samantha Chester, alternating weeks between the Plaintiff and Defendant.

7. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances. The Defendant, Michael Chester, has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that significantly impairs their physical abilities.

8. Due to this condition, the Defendant has experienced multiple falls at home and has been advised by medical professionals not to be alone with the child near stairs or in situations requiring quick physical responses.

9. Despite the medical advice, the Defendant insists on maintaining the 50/50 custody arrangement and at times relies on the child to assist with physical tasks beyond her age-appropriate responsibilities.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF
10. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to reflect the best interests of the child, Samantha Chester. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests primary physical custody with reasonable visitation for the Defendant consistent with their physical limitations.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:
a. Modify the current custody arrangement to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Lara Chester;
b. Grant reasonable visitation rights to the Defendant, Michael Chester, considering his physical limitations;
c. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Lara Chester, Plaintiff
