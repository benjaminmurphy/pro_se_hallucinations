JESSICA MILLER, Plaintiff

v.

SAMANTHA HARRIS, Defendant

Civil Action No. _________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Samantha Harris, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, is an adult individual residing at 123 Main Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

2. Defendant, Samantha Harris, is the owner of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in Worcester Superior Court as the cause of action arose within Worcester County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On February 15, 2023, at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603, Plaintiff was delivering groceries to a tenant of a three-unit apartment building owned by Defendant.

6. Despite a recent snowstorm, Defendant negligently failed to adequately clear and de-ice the sidewalk in front of the property.

7. Instead, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but did not apply any salt or sand to prevent the formation of ice.

8. As a result of the negligent maintenance of the sidewalk by Defendant, the narrow path created by Defendant turned into a sheet of ice, posing an unreasonable risk of harm to individuals lawfully using the sidewalk.

9. Plaintiff, unaware of the hazardous condition, walked up the sidewalk in the course of her delivery duties, slipped on the ice patch created by Defendant's negligence, fell backward, and suffered a lower back injury.

10. The tenants of the apartment building had notified Defendant of the dangerous icy conditions by texting her and providing pictures of the hazard. Defendant, in response, recklessly disregarded the warnings and refused to take appropriate action to remedy the situation, stating "the sun will take care of it."

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries to her lower back, incurring medical expenses of approximately $2,500 and lost wages of about $800 due to the week she had to take off work for treatment and recovery.

CAUSE OF ACTION - NEGLIGENCE

12. Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition for the benefit of individuals lawfully using the walkway.

13. Defendant breached this duty by negligently failing to properly clear and de-ice the sidewalk, creating a hazardous condition that led to Plaintiff's injuries.

14. Defendant's negligent actions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Samantha Harris, and grant the following relief:

a. Economic damages in the amount of $3,300, representing medical expenses of approximately $2,500 and lost wages of about $800;
b. Interest on the economic damages as allowed by law;
c. Costs and disbursements incurred in bringing this action; and
d. Any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
