**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, James Carter, states as follows:

**PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, is a custodial parent of the minor child involved in this matter, Sophie Carter, age 8, and resides at [Plaintiff's Address].

2. The Defendant, James Carter, is the non-custodial parent and resides at [Defendant's Address].

**BACKGROUND**

3. On October 15, 2019, a custody order was entered awarding primary custody of Sophie Carter to the Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, and granting the Defendant, James Carter, visitation rights every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

4. The original custodial arrangement was established when both parties resided in the same town, facilitating convenient and practical exchanges for the midweek overnight visitation.

5. Subsequently, the Defendant relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the child's residence.

**REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

6. Due to the significant change in circumstances resulting from the Defendant's relocation and the ensuing negative impact on the well-being of the minor child, the Plaintiff seeks the following modifications:

   a. Elimination of the midweek overnight visitation on Wednesdays;
   
   b. Adjustment to the weekend visitation schedule to ensure the minor child's welfare and academic performance are not compromised.

**LEGAL BASIS**

7. The Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which grants the court authority to modify custody orders if it is in the best interests of the child.

8. The modification request is also in accordance with Massachusetts case law precedent, including but not limited to Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), which emphasizes the importance of the child's well-being and overall health in custody decisions.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to reflect the requested changes for the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Carter.
