      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The proposition asserts that defendant\u2019s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of a plaintiff child\u2019s injuries and resulting economic losses. Palsgraf does not involve a child, medical expenses, or lost wages, and, more importantly, the Court holds there was no actionable negligence or duty owed to the plaintiff at all. Cardozo\u2019s opinion rejects liability on duty/foreseeability grounds and expressly states that issues of proximate cause and damages are not reached, so it cannot be cited to support the proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The conduct of the defendant\u2019s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus removed. Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the violation of a right.\u2026 The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us.\""

The provided opinion is a Sixth Circuit standing decision in a Fair Housing Act and civil rights housing discrimination case; it does not involve negligence, physical injury, proximate cause, or damages of the type described. Therefore, this case cannot be authority for the stated negligence-causation proposition.",

Sec. 3604, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, and Secs. 1981, 1982, 1983, 42 U.S.C.  The issue on appeal is whether plaintiff Smith\u2026has standing to pursue the action."

It does not involve a community center, supervision of children, or any discussion of a duty of care toward children under supervision. Therefore, it provides no authority for the asserted negligence-duty proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the out-of-court statements made by the co-conspirators, Bo Collins and Lattimore, sufficiently established a prima facie case of a conspiracy between themselves and defendant.\n\nFinally, defendant contends that his sentence of 30 years is unfairly disparate with Albert Lattimore\u2019s sentence of 18 years for the same crime... Under these facts we cannot say the trial court\u2019s sentence was an abuse of discretion."

It does not address premises liability, negligence, duty of care, supervision of children, or hazardous activities. The discussion of \u2018kids\u2019 and \u2018young men entrusted to his care and supervision\u2019 is in the context of reputational stigma, not a tort duty to supervise or breach thereof, so it does not support the stated negligence proposition.",

It deals with statutory construction, the definition of \u201cmajor alterations,\u201d and vagueness/due process concerns. It does not involve negligence, duty of care, supervision of children, or any factual context about unsafe activities or hazardous conduct, so it cannot support the stated proposition about breach of a duty of care through inadequate supervision.",

L. c. 148, \u00a7 26G, to install an adequate system of automatic sprinklers in the building.\""
