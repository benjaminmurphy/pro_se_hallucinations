IN THE SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT

Jessica Harmon
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Sullivan
Defendant

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Harmon (“Plaintiff”), and files this Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Sullivan (“Defendant”), based on the following facts and legal claims:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Harmon, is a tenant residing at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

2. Defendant, Mark Sullivan, is the landlord of the property located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on January 1, 2022, to rent an apartment at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143, for a monthly rent of $1,800.

6. Since approximately six months ago, noisy and disruptive tenants moved into the unit above Plaintiff’s residence.

7. The noise generated by the upstairs tenants includes constant stomping, late-night music playing, and what appears to be furniture moving at unreasonable hours.

8. Plaintiff has made numerous complaints to Defendant about the noise disturbances caused by the upstairs tenants.

9. Defendant, after minimal intervention, informed Plaintiff that he "can't control how people live."

10. The disruptive noise has significantly impacted Plaintiff's ability to rest and sleep, resulting in serious consequences such as falling asleep at work, incurring a written warning, and needing to take sleep medication at an additional cost of $40 per month.

11. Despite the attempts made by Plaintiff to address the issue, the disruptive noise persists unabated, causing severe disturbance to Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment: Defendant, as the landlord, has a legal duty to ensure that the tenant enjoys quiet possession and peaceful enjoyment of the leased premises. By failing to effectively address the ongoing disruptive noise caused by the upstairs tenants, Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Issue an order requiring Defendant to take immediate action to abate the noise disturbances caused by the upstairs tenants;

B. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $2,000, representing compensation for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and related costs incurred;

C. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
