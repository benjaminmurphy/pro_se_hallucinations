v.

QuickRide Rideshare, LLC
Defendant

Case No: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Reynolds, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Reynolds is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City], Massachusetts.

2. Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC is a rideshare company registered to do business in Massachusetts with its principal place of business at [Defendant's Address], [City], Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218 § 19, as the actions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court as the incident giving rise to this action occurred at 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA on August 15, 2023.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully operating his bicycle in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.

6. Defendant's employee, while acting within the scope of their employment, was operating a vehicle parked in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.

7. Without checking his mirror or surroundings, the employee of Defendant suddenly swung open the vehicle's door directly into Plaintiff's path, causing Plaintiff to crash into the edge of the door and sustain injuries.

8. At the scene of the incident, Defendant's employee admitted to being distracted by their phone and stated, "I didn't see you," acknowledging their negligence.

9. However, when Plaintiff filed a claim with Defendant's insurance, they falsely claimed that Plaintiff was "weaving in and out of traffic," which is a baseless accusation as Plaintiff was lawfully biking in the designated bike lane.

10. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff suffered road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bike frame.

11. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $400 in wages due to the injuries sustained from the incident caused by Defendant's negligence.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to operate its vehicles safely and in accordance with traffic laws to prevent harm to others on the road.

13. Defendant breached this duty of care by negligently opening the vehicle door into Plaintiff's path without looking, causing the collision that resulted in Plaintiff's injuries.

14. Defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Reynolds requests judgment against Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC, as follows:

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $1,600 for medical expenses and lost wages.

2. Any other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
