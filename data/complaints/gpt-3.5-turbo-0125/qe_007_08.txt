IN THE CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX

Emily Carter, Plaintiff

v.

Marcus Greenfield, Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her complaint against Defendant Marcus Greenfield, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA 02138.

2. Defendant Marcus Greenfield is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA 02138.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the claim arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court as the subject property is located in Cambridge, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of an apartment at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA.

6. Since on or about October 1, 2025, Defendant began renovating the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's residence, resulting in continuous and excessive noise from drilling, hammering, and loud conversations of construction workers during the hours of 8 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.

7. The ongoing construction noise has disrupted Plaintiff's ability to work from home, causing interference with work-related calls and making it challenging for Plaintiff to concentrate and carry out her daily activities in her residence.

8. Additionally, Plaintiff has been subjected to dust entering her unit through the vents due to the construction activities, further diminishing her quality of life and peaceful enjoyment of the premises.

9. While Defendant provided advance notice of the renovation, the prolonged and disruptive nature of the construction has significantly interfered with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the leased premises for an extended period of time.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

10. Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

11. Defendant's actions in allowing and prolonging disruptive construction activities have breached the implied warranty of habitability and quiet enjoyment inherent in every lease agreement.

12. This breach has caused Plaintiff to suffer damages, including but not limited to loss of use of the premises, mental distress, inconvenience, and reduction in the value of the leasehold interest.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

a. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff for compensatory damages in the amount of $2000;
b. Any further relief this Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
