Bower v. Bournay-Bower does not address relocation, substantial/material change, or the practical burdens of travel on a parenting-time schedule. Instead, it addresses the probate court\u2019s inherent authority (and limits) to appoint a parenting coordinator and the unlawful delegation of judicial authority.

The Court quotes the ALI Principles that relocation is a substantial change when it \u2018significantly impairs\u2019 a parent\u2019s ability to exercise responsibilities and emphasizes how greater travel time between homes and schools and other burdens of distance can negatively affect the child. Although the specific distances differ, the case clearly supports using a relocation and its commuting burdens as grounds to claim a material change in circumstances affecting custody and visitation.",
