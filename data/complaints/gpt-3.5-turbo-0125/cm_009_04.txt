IN THE PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
BARNSTABLE COUNTY

Jessica Thompson,
Plaintiff,

v.

Michael Smith,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Smith, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of [Your Town], Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is a resident of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of Ava Smith, an 8-year-old child born on [Child's DOB].

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter due to the ongoing custody proceedings between the parties for Ava Smith and pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 209C, Section 10(a).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 15, 2019, a custody order was entered by this Court, granting primary custody to the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and providing the Defendant, Michael Smith, with parenting time every other weekend and a midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, the Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the Plaintiff's residence.

7. The Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight visitation, which now entails a significant amount of travel for Ava Smith on a school night. The Defendant picks Ava up from school, drives her to Cape Cod, and then returns her to school early the next morning, resulting in Ava experiencing exhaustion and a noticeable decline in participation at school on Thursdays.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

8. In light of the substantial change in circumstances due to the Defendant's relocation and the resulting impact on Ava's wellbeing and school performance, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and adjust the weekend schedule to ensure Ava is not subjected to excessive travel on school nights.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation for Ava Smith;

B. Adjust the weekend visitation schedule for Michael Smith to reflect the elimination of the midweek overnight;

C. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DATED: December 1, 2025.
