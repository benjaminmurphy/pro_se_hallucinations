Coleman addressed the standard for removal under G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 when parents share joint physical and legal custody, holding that \u2018cause shown\u2019 means a best-interests analysis in that context. The opinion does not frame relocation as a \u2018substantial change in circumstances\u2019 for purposes of modifying custody, nor does it adopt the ALI\u2019s \u2018substantial change\u2019 language as Massachusetts law; that text appears only in a block quote describing the ALI Principles, not as the court\u2019s own holding. Thus, the case does not stand for the proposition that relocation itself constitutes a substantial change justifying modification of custody.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.17 (2002), as adopted and promulgated by the American Law Institute, state in pertinent part:\n\u201c(1) The relocation of a parent constitutes a substantial change in circumstances . . . only when the relocation significantly impairs either parent\u2019s ability to exercise responsibilities the parent has been exercising or attempting to exercise [under the judgement of divorce]\u2026\u201d\n\u2026 ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution, supra at \u00a7 2.17 (1), (4) (c) \u2026 support the view that where \u201cneither parent has been exercising a clear majority of custodial responsibility,\u201d the effect of the relocation on the child is a \u201crelevant factor[]\u201d in determining the child\u2019s best interests."
