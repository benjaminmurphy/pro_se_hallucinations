Rachel Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Henderson
Defendant

Case No.: [to be filled by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Rachel Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Henderson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson is an individual residing at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, MA.

2. Defendant Mark Henderson is the landlord of the residential property located at the aforementioned address.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19.

4. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court as the subject property is located in Somerville, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of an apartment at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, MA.

6. The lease agreement explicitly grants Plaintiff the right to quiet enjoyment of the premises, as mandated by Massachusetts landlord-tenant law (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14).

7. Since approximately six months ago, the tenants occupying the unit above Plaintiff's apartment have been consistently disruptive by creating excessive noise, including but not limited to stomping, loud music, and late-night furniture moving.

8. Despite multiple complaints by Plaintiff to Defendant regarding the noise disturbances, Defendant has failed to take adequate measures to address the issue, stating that he "can't control how people live."

9. The persistent noise disturbances have significantly impacted Plaintiff's quality of life, causing severe sleep deprivation and resulting in adverse consequences such as a written warning at work and out-of-pocket expenses for sleep medication.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's failure to address the ongoing noise disturbances constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential lease in Massachusetts (Kuzmeskus v. Pickup, 790 N.E.2d 1021, 1026 (Mass. 2003)).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Order Defendant to take immediate and effective action to abate the noise disturbances emanating from the unit above Plaintiff's apartment;

B. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $2400, representing compensation for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

C. Grant any further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
