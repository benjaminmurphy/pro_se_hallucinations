Jessica Hartley,
Plaintiff

v.

Robert Thompson,
Defendant

Case No. ________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Hartley, and complains of the Defendant, Robert Thompson, as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Hartley, is an individual residing at 27 Wilcock St, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. The Defendant, Robert Thompson, is the landlord of the residential premises located at 27 Wilcock St, Dorchester, MA 02124, where the Plaintiff resides.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action seeks redress for the Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a matter falling within the jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 185C, section 3.

4. Venue is proper in the Dorchester Division of the Housing Court Department as the property at issue is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. The Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant on June 1, 2022, for the premises located at 27 Wilcock St, Dorchester, MA 02124, for a monthly rent of $1,800.

6. Since the winter of 2022-2023, the Plaintiff has experienced repeated disruptions in the heating system at the rented premises. The heating system has intermittently failed, leading to a significant drop in indoor temperatures, especially in the evenings, resulting in discomfort and health consequences for the Plaintiff.

7. Despite two repair attempts by the Defendant's service personnel, the heating system continues to malfunction, causing the Plaintiff to resort to supplemental heating methods, including the use of electric space heaters. The Plaintiff's electric bill has increased by approximately $150 per month due to the malfunctioning heating system.

8. The repeated heating system failures have not only led to financial damages for the Plaintiff but have also resulted in health issues, including bronchitis in January 2025, exacerbating the Plaintiff's illness and necessitating medical treatment and missed workdays.

CAUSE OF ACTION

9. The Defendant's repeated failure to provide adequate and consistent heating at the leased premises constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, section 14.

10. The Defendant's actions, as described herein, have substantially interfered with the Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, entitling the Plaintiff to relief under the law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
2. Award the Plaintiff damages in the amount of $650, representing the additional electric costs incurred and health-related expenses due to the Defendant's actions;
3. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances; and
4. Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney's fees pursuant to Massachusetts statutes and case law.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]
