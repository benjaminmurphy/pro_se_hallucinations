Emma Richardson, Plaintiff	
v.		
Jacob Thompson, Defendant
Docket No. __________

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

COMES NOW, Plaintiff, Emma Richardson, by and through counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against Defendant, Jacob Thompson, alleges as follows:

1. The parties, Emma Richardson and Jacob Thompson, are the parents of two minor children, Ava Richardson (age 10) and Lucas Richardson (age 8).

2. On June 15, 2021, this Honorable Court entered a judgment providing that Petitioner, Emma Richardson, shall have primary physical custody of the minor children, with Respondent, Jacob Thompson, having alternate weekends and one midweek visitation.

3. A material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody order, warranting modification of the current custody arrangement. Specifically, Defendant Jacob Thompson now resides with a person who has a criminal record for assault and battery, a history of domestic violence, and has exhibited violent and aggressive behavior in the presence of the minor children.

4. On an occasion when the children were visiting Defendant and his cohabitant, a neighbor called the police due to a loud argument, indicating a potentially unsafe environment for the children.

5. The minor children have reported instances of the cohabitant yelling, slamming doors, and physically grabbing one of them with enough force to leave a visible mark, which raises serious concerns about the children's safety and well-being during visitations with Defendant.

6. It is in the best interests of the minor children that the custody arrangement be modified to either restrict the presence of the cohabitant during visitations or require supervised visitation to ensure the children's safety and protection.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff moves this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to protect the best interests of the minor children in light of the changed circumstances described herein.

Respectfully submitted,
