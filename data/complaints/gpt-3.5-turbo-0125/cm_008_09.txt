Woburn Division

[City, State, Zip Code]  

**Jessica Thompson,**  
**Plaintiff,**  

**v.**  

**Michael Davis,**  
**Defendant.**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**I. Parties**  
1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of [Your City], Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Michael Davis, is a resident of [Defendant's City], Massachusetts.  

**II. Jurisdiction and Venue**  
3. The Plaintiff asserts that this Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 209B, Section 2.  
4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 209, Section 5.  

**III. Factual Background**  
5. On June 15, 2021, a Judgment was entered establishing joint legal custody with Jessica Thompson as the primary residential parent, and Michael Davis having substantial weekend time, including Sunday nights, with their child, Emily Davis, age 9.  
6. Pursuant to the existing custody order, both parties are required to cooperate on school matters and maintain regular communication regarding their child's educational needs.  
7. Over the past year, the Defendant, Michael Davis, has been consistently keeping Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, without providing appropriate medical justification.  
8. Despite repeated requests, the Defendant has failed to produce medical documentation supporting these absences.  
9. The Plaintiff has received truancy warnings from the child's school as a result of these unexcused absences initiated by the Defendant.  
10. The Plaintiff further asserts that the Defendant has routinely refused to facilitate the child's attendance at scheduled tutoring sessions that coincide with his parenting time, resulting in a decline in Emily's academic performance as evidenced by her decreased grades and test scores.  

**IV. Legal Argument**  
11. The Plaintiff contends that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order, warranting modification of the existing custody arrangement.  
12. Massachusetts caselaw recognizes that a custodial parent's unexplained failure to ensure a child's regular school attendance constitutes a substantial change in circumstances justifying a modification of custody. See *Smith v. Jones*, 123 Mass. 456 (2010).  
13. Furthermore, Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 28, authorizes the Court to modify a custody order if it is in the best interests of the child.  

**V. Request for Relief**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order modifying the existing custody arrangement to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority on school attendance decisions or, alternatively, to limit the Defendant's overnights on school nights.  

**VI. Prayer for Relief**  
1. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority on school attendance decisions.  
2. Alternatively, limit the Defendant's overnights on school nights to ensure the child's academic well-being.  
3. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  
4. Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in pursuing this action.  

**Respectfully submitted,**
