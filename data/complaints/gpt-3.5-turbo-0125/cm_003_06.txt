COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jennifer Collins, residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code], without the assistance of counsel, and hereby files this Complaint for Modification against Defendant Mark Collins, residing at [Defendant's Address], [City, State, Zip Code], respectfully stating as follows:

1. PARTIES: The Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, and the Defendant, Mark Collins, are the parents of Ethan Collins, a minor child born on [Ethan's Date of Birth], currently eight years old.

2. JURISDICTION: This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209 section 48, in Worcester Probate and Family Court.

3. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS:
   a. On September 15, 2021, this Court entered an order granting shared legal custody of Ethan Collins to both parents, with primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, and visitation with the Defendant, Mark Collins, on certain weekends.
   b. Recently, concerning behaviors and incidents have come to Plaintiff's attention, causing her to fear for Ethan's safety in Defendant's care. Ethan has reported to Plaintiff concerning behaviors, including the presence of "special drinks" at Defendant's residence and instances where Defendant "can't walk straight."
   c. A concerned neighbor provided Plaintiff with a video showing Defendant stumbling while handling Ethan late at night. Additionally, Ethan has been exhibiting signs of exhaustion at school on Monday mornings, raising concerns about his well-being and safety.
   
4. REQUESTED MODIFICATION: Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to include supervised visitation or such other conditions deemed necessary by the Court, in the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Collins.

5. LEGAL AUTHORITY:
   a. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209 section 38 provides that custody orders may be modified based on a substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original order.
   b. In the case of Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court established the "real advantages" test as the standard for determining whether a modification of custody is warranted.
   c. Further, in Bains v. Bains, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 922 (1996), the Court held that any substantial change affecting the welfare of the child can be grounds for modifying a custody order.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jennifer Collins prays that this Honorable Court grants the requested modification of the custody order to ensure the safety and well-being of Ethan Collins.

DATED: December 1, 2025.
