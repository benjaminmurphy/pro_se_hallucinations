While D.U. was visiting with her friends, Norton attempted to \"French kiss\" D.U., touched her upper thigh and vagina, tried to entice D.U. to lie on the bed with him, and invited her to go into the woods with him.... Norton was arrested, charged, and convicted of two counts of child molesting. He now appeals."

These counts further alleged that because of the number and severity of curves in the road in the area of the accident, the road was dangerous for travel at the posted or permitted speed, and that the number and severity of the curves was not readily apparent to a motorist traveling the road. Plaintiff alleged the township negligently breached its duty to exercise due care in erecting and posting signs and in warning motorists of hazards on the road\u2026"
