Jessica Lee
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, in the above-captioned case, and files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on March 15, 2022. The Plaintiff states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

3. The children of the parties subject to the current custody order are Emma Johnson, age 10.

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209B, Section 2.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On March 15, 2022, this Court entered a custody order granting shared legal custody to the parties, with Jessica Lee designated as the primary residential parent, and Michael Johnson awarded substantial weekend time, including Sunday nights.

6. Per the existing order, the parties are expected to cooperate on school matters and keep each other informed.

7. In the past year, the Defendant, Michael Johnson, has been regularly keeping Emma home from school on Mondays after their scheduled weekends together, citing "mental health days."

8. Despite no medical documentation supporting these absences, the Defendant has continuously kept Emma home, resulting in truancy warnings from the school and a decline in Emma's academic performance.

9. The Defendant has also failed to comply with the order by consistently refusing to take Emma to tutoring sessions that fall within his scheduled weekends.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

10. The Plaintiff requests a modification of the existing custody order to provide that she shall have final decision-making authority regarding school attendance decisions for Emma, or alternatively, to reduce the Defendant's weekday overnight visitation rights.

11. The Plaintiff seeks this modification in the best interests of Emma, to ensure her continued academic success and well-being.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order as requested above, and grant such other relief deemed just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025.
