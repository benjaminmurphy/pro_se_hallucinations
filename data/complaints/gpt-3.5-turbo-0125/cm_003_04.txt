IN THE NORFOLK COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

The Plaintiff, JENNIFER SMITH, by and through the undersigned counsel, hereby files this Complaint for Modification of the custody order against the Defendant, DAVID JOHNSON, stating as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, JENNIFER SMITH, is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.
2. The Defendant, DAVID JOHNSON, is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On May 15, 2021, the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court entered a custody order granting shared legal custody of the minor child, MICHAEL JOHNSON, to both parties.
4. Pursuant to the custody order, MICHAEL primarily resides with the Plaintiff, JENNIFER, and visits the Defendant, DAVID, on certain weekends.
5. Recent events have raised serious concerns about the safety and well-being of the minor child in the care of the Defendant.
6. MICHAEL has reported to the Plaintiff that there are "special drinks" at the Defendant's residence and that the Defendant sometimes "can't walk straight."
7. A concerned neighbor provided the Plaintiff with a video showing the Defendant stumbling while handling the minor child late at night.
8. The school has observed signs of exhaustion in MICHAEL every Monday morning following visits with the Defendant.
9. Based on the above circumstances, the Plaintiff believes that there has been a material change in circumstances that warrants modification of the existing custody order to ensure the safety and best interests of the minor child.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to impose conditions, including supervised visitation or any other appropriate safeguards, to protect the well-being of the minor child, MICHAEL JOHNSON.

Respectfully submitted,

[signature]
