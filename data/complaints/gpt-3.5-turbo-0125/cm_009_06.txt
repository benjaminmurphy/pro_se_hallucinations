IN THE BARNSTABLE PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
SARAH THOMPSON, Plaintiff,

v.

MICHAEL ADAMS, Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and files this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Adams, and states the following:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, resides at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip].
2. Defendant, Michael Adams, resides at [His Address].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which governs custody proceedings.
4. Venue is proper in Barnstable Probate and Family Court as the original custody order was entered by this Court on April 15, 2019.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On April 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting primary custody of the minor child, Emily Adams, to Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and awarding Defendant, Michael Adams, every other weekend visitation and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.
6. Since the entry of the original custody order, Defendant has relocated from the shared town to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away.
7. Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight on Wednesdays, which now involves picking up the minor child after her school day, driving her to Cape Cod for the overnight visit, and then rushing her back early in the morning for school the next day.
8. The extended travel and disrupted sleep schedule have significantly impacted the minor child's well-being and academic performance. Her teacher has reported a noticeable decline in participation and energy levels on Thursdays following the midweek overnight visits.
9. Plaintiff asserts that the current custody arrangement is no longer in the best interest of the minor child due to the material change in circumstances resulting from Defendant's relocation, necessitating modification of the existing custody order.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

1. Modify the custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation on Wednesdays.
2. Adjust the weekend visitation schedule to ensure the minor child does not have to undertake long overnight drives on school nights.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court grant the requested modification of the custody order for the minor child, Emily Adams, and provide such further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

DATED: December 1, 2025.
