COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by and through the undersigned Legal Assistant, and alleges as follows against Defendant Thomas Roberts ("Defendant"):

[1] Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is a resident of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

[2] Defendant, Thomas Roberts, is a resident and property owner located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

[3] On or about July 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was walking on the sidewalk adjacent to Defendant's property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, a large branch from a tree on Defendant's property fell and struck Plaintiff, causing her to sustain a shoulder strain and extensive bruising.

[4] Prior to the incident, it was observed by Plaintiff and others in the neighborhood that the branch in question appeared cracked and droopy, prompting concerns about its stability and the potential danger it posed. Residents, including Plaintiff, warned Defendant of the hazardous condition, advising him to seek inspection and remediation by an arborist. Defendant assured them that he would address the issue in the near future but failed to act in a timely manner, resulting in the branch eventually fracturing and causing harm to Plaintiff.

[5] As a direct result of Defendant's negligence in failing to properly maintain the tree on his property and address the known dangerous condition promptly, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, necessitating medical treatment, incurring approximately $2,500 in medical expenses, and lost wages in the amount of $600 due to missed work.

[6] The conduct of Defendant constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 231, Section 85:

"Negligence is the failure to use such care as a reasonably prudent and careful person would use under similar circumstances."

[7] Massachusetts courts have consistently held property owners accountable for injuries caused by hazardous conditions on their premises due to negligence. In Trotto v. Berry, 316 Mass. 44 (1944), the court found a landowner liable for damages when a tree limb fell and injured a passerby due to the property owner's failure to inspect and maintain the tree adequately. Similarly, in Ellenberg v. Pink Construct. Co., 312 Mass. 6 (1942), the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff injured by a falling object from a building, citing the property owner's duty to maintain a safe premises and prevent foreseeable harm to others.

[8] Plaintiff seeks the following relief from this Honorable Court:

    a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $3,100, representing medical expenses and lost wages;
    b. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
    c. Costs and attorney's fees pursuant to Massachusetts law;
    d. Any other relief deemed just and equitable by the Court.

[9] WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Thomas Roberts, for the relief requested above and for such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025
