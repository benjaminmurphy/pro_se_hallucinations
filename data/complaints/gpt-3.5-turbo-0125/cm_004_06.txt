Jessica Thompson, Plaintiff v. Mark Rivera, Defendant Docket No.:

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, pro se, and hereby respectfully brings this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Rivera, alleging as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is a resident of [Your City], [Your State].

2. Defendant Mark Rivera is a resident of [Defendant's City], [Defendant's State].

3. The parties have one child together, Ethan Thompson, age 8.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws ch. 209B, § 2, and ch. 215, § 6.

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County as the existing custody order was entered in this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 15, 2019, the Court entered an order granting primary physical custody of Ethan Thompson to the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and providing the Defendant, Mark Rivera, with three brief visits during the week and Sunday afternoons, with no overnights.

7. Since the issuance of the original custody order, there has been a substantial change in circumstances. Specifically, Ethan Thompson is now 8 years old, attends school full time, and desires overnight stays at his father's residence.

8. Ethan Thompson's preferences and needs have evolved to warrant adjustments to the current custody arrangement. His father, Mark Rivera, now has a suitable living arrangement with a separate bedroom for Ethan, making overnights feasible and beneficial for their relationship.
