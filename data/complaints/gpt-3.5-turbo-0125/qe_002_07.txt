SUPERIOR COURT DEPARTMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

Civil Action No.:

MAYA JOHNSON,

Plaintiff,

v.

LISA THOMPSON,

Defendant.

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Maya Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant, Lisa Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Maya Johnson, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA.

2. The Defendant, Lisa Thompson, is a landlord who owns and manages the property located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This court has jurisdiction over this matter as the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limit of this court.

4. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court as the Property subject to this action is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or around October 15, 2025, the Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to medical bills but ultimately paid the full amount, including late fees.

6. In November 2025, the Plaintiff notified the Defendant of water seeping into the basement unit through the walls when it rained heavily, causing damage to personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, totaling approximately $400 in damages.

7. Despite being informed of the water intrusion issue by the Plaintiff, the Defendant failed to timely address and remedy the water seepage problem, leading to ongoing damage and the need for the Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier continuously, resulting in increased electricity costs.

8. Subsequently, a city inspection was conducted in response to the Plaintiff's complaint, which revealed various code violations, including the water intrusion issue.

9. The Defendant, instead of promptly rectifying the water leakage and addressing the code violations, retaliated against the Plaintiff by indicating that she would not renew the lease, purportedly due to the late rent payment in October 2025. Such refusal appears disconnected from the actual reason for non-renewal, which emanated from the property's deteriorating conditions.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. The Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, which mandates that landlords must maintain premises in compliance with sanitary and building codes and refrain from retaliating against tenants for making good faith complaints.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Award damages in the amount of $400 for the property damage incurred by the Plaintiff;

2. Order the Defendant to promptly repair the water seepage issue and perform all necessary repairs to bring the property into compliance with applicable codes;

3. Enjoin the Defendant from any further retaliatory actions against the Plaintiff;

4. Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in pursuing this action; and

5. Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
