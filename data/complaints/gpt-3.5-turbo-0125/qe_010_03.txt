IN THE LOWELL DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX
MASSACHUSETTS

Jessica Turner,
Plaintiff

v.

Linda Martinez,
Defendant.

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Turner, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Linda Martinez, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. Defendant Linda Martinez is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 186, § 15B and ch. 218, § 19.

4. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852, for a monthly rent of $1300.

6. Since occupying the premises, Plaintiff discovered the presence of mold in the bathroom, which originated in the shower corner and subsequently spread to the ceiling.

7. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the mold issue, whereupon Defendant inspected the premises and falsely attributed the mold growth to Plaintiff's purported failure to run the exhaust fan adequately and taking hot showers.

8. Despite Plaintiff's maintenance of the premises and use of the exhaust fan during showers, Defendant refused to address the underlying ventilation problems causing the mold proliferation.

9. The mold infestation has caused Plaintiff to suffer respiratory issues such as coughing, congestion, and wheezing, leading to medical expenses and necessitating the disposal of mold-infested personal items worth approximately $60.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant's failure to address the ventilation inadequacies resulting in the growth of mold in the bathroom constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 186, § 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for damages in the amount of $200 and any additional amounts as proven at trial;
b. Award costs and attorney's fees pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 186, § 14; and
c. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
