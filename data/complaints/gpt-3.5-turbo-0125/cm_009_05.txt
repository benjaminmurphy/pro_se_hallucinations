IN THE PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
BARNSTABLE, MASSACHUSETTS

Jessica Lane, Plaintiff, 

v.

Mark Lane, Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, is a resident of [Your Town], Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Mark Lane, is a resident of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

3. The parties were formerly married and are the parents of Sophia Lane, born on [date of birth].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209, Section 32.

5. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court as the minor child, Sophia Lane, is a resident of this county.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting primary custody of Sophia Lane to the Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, and providing the Defendant, Mark Lane, with visitation rights every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

7. Since the entry of the original custody order, the Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the Plaintiff's residence.

8. The Defendant continues to exercise his right to the midweek overnight visitation, requiring Sophia Lane, age 8, to endure a long car journey late at night which disrupts her sleep and academic performance.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

9. The Plaintiff requests the modification of the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation with the Defendant and adjust the weekend visitation schedule to ensure that Sophia Lane is not subjected to unnecessary travel and fatigue on school nights.

10. It is the Plaintiff's belief that the current arrangement is detrimental to Sophia Lane's well-being and academic success, as evidenced by her increased fatigue and reduced participation at school on Thursdays.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

- Modification of the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation with the Defendant.
- Adjustment of the weekend visitation schedule to ensure Sophia Lane's well-being and academic performance are not compromised.
- Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Jessica Lane, Plaintiff

Dated: December 1, 2025
