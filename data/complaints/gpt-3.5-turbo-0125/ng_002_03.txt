JESSICA WANG,

v.

MICHAEL DAVIDSON,
Defendant

Case No. _____________

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Wang, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Davidson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Wang is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. Defendant Michael Davidson is an individual believed to reside at or operate from 30 Cole Ave, Newton, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter [cite relevant statute].

4. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 30 Cole Ave, Newton, MA on June 15, 2023.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff Jessica Wang was jogging on a path in a park in Newton, where signs mandate all dogs to be on leashes.

6. The Defendant, Michael Davidson, as the owner of a large dog, knowingly and regularly allows his dog to run around off-leash in violation of park regulations.

7. While Plaintiff was running on the path, Defendant's unleashed dog charged at her, barking loudly and appearing menacing.

8. Despite being approximately thirty feet away, Defendant was negligently talking with friends and holding the leash over his shoulder without attaching it to the dog.

9. Fearing an imminent dog bite, Plaintiff swerved off the path to avoid the dog, tripped over a tree root, and fell down a small embankment, resulting in a broken wrist.

10. The dog ceased its aggressive behavior once Plaintiff fell, at which point Defendant belatedly called the dog back.

11. Several other joggers at the scene witnessed the entire incident.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence in allowing his dog to be unleashed and unchecked, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist requiring medical treatment, incurring approximately $2,500 in medical expenses, and lost $1,200 in wages due to the injury.

CAUSE OF ACTION

13. The Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff and breached that duty by allowing his dog to be off-leash in a public park frequented by pedestrians and joggers.

14. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries.

15. Based on the above facts, the Defendant is liable to the Plaintiff for negligence under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Wang respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $3,700 for medical expenses and lost wages;
2. Award Plaintiff any further relief that the Court deems just and proper; and
3. Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
