v.

Michael Davis
Defendant

Docket No.:

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and for her Complaint for Modification of Custody Order against the Defendant, Michael Davis, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, currently resides at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip].

2. The Defendant, Michael Davis, currently resides at [His Address], Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

3. The parties were married and are the parents of one child, Sophie Davis, born on [Child's Date of Birth].

BACKGROUND

4. The parties were granted a Judgment of Divorce Nisi on May 15, 2019, by this Honorable Court, which included a custody order granting primary custody of Sophie to the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and awarding the Defendant, Michael Davis, visitation every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

5. At the time of the original custody order, both parties resided in the same town, facilitating the midweek overnight visit with minimal disruption to Sophie's school routine.

6. Since the entry of the original custody order in 2019, the Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the Plaintiff's residence, necessitating significant travel for midweek overnight visits.

7. The Defendant's insistence on retaining the midweek overnight visitation has resulted in Sophie being subjected to extensive travel during school nights, causing her chronic exhaustion and a noticeable decline in academic performance, as reported by her teacher.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

8. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and to adjust the visitation schedule for weekends to ensure that long-distance travel does not interfere with Sophie's academic and emotional well-being.

LAW AND AUTHORITY

9. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 28, the Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction to modify custody orders upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances.

10. Massachusetts case law, including Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704(1985), establishes that a custodial parent seeking modification must demonstrate that the proposed change is in the best interests of the child and that there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare since the entry of the original order.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation;

2. Adjust the visitation schedule to ensure the best interests of the child, Sophie Davis; and

3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
