IN THE PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
MIDDLESEX COUNTY

Sarah Thompson, Plaintiff

v.

Michael Johnson, Defendant

Docket No.:

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and files this Complaint seeking a modification of the existing custody order, and in support thereof, alleges as follows:

1. Parties:
The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is a resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is also a resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Background:
a. This action concerns the custody of the parties' minor child, Emily Johnson, currently ten years old.
b. The original custody order was entered by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2018, granting primary residence to the Defendant and limited weekend time and one weeknight dinner to the Plaintiff.
c. Since the entry of the original order, there has been a substantial change in circumstances that warrant a modification of the custody arrangement.

3. Change in Circumstances:
a. The Plaintiff has completed her graduate studies, secured a stable job with regular hours, and now resides in a two-bedroom apartment, providing a suitable living environment for the minor child.
b. The minor child, Emily Johnson, has expressed a strong desire for increased time with the Plaintiff and has indicated her preference for more overnights at the Plaintiff's residence.
c. It has been observed by the minor child's therapist that she feels guilty about the limited time spent with the Plaintiff and desires a more substantial and consistent relationship with her mother.

4. Legal Basis for Modification:
a. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, the Court has the authority to modify a custody judgment upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances and when such modification is in the best interests of the child.
b. In the case of Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that a modification of a custody order is appropriate when there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.
c. Additionally, in Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 276 (2007), the Appeals Court emphasized the importance of considering the child's best interests when determining custody modifications.

5. Requested Relief:
The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to grant her increased parenting time and overnights with the minor child, Emily Johnson, in a manner that reflects the child's best interests.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
1. Modify the current custody arrangement;
2. Grant the Plaintiff increased parenting time and overnights with the minor child; and
3. Provide such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,

Plaintiff
