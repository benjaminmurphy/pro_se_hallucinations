COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jordan Tyler, and files this Complaint against the Defendant, Sophia Martinez, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jordan Tyler, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. The Defendant, Sophia Martinez, is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, where the Plaintiff resides.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships, particularly pertaining to the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 185C, Section 1, and Chapter 218, Section 19.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about March 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a basement unit at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, for a monthly rent of $1200.

5. In October 2025, the Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to unforeseen medical bills. The Plaintiff paid the rent in full, including the late fee, in due course.

6. In November 2025, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant of water seepage issues in the basement unit whenever it rained heavily. The Defendant acknowledged the issue but failed to take appropriate action.

7. The Plaintiff subsequently contacted the city authorities to inspect the premises, which revealed not only the water seepage issue but also other code violations.

8. The water seepage problem resulted in damage to the Plaintiff's personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, amounting to approximately $400.

9. The Plaintiff was also forced to run a dehumidifier continuously due to the water seepage issue, resulting in increased electric bills.

10. Despite the Plaintiff's legitimate concerns about the habitability of the premises, the Defendant has failed to address the water seepage issue, posing ongoing hardships to the Plaintiff.

11. Furthermore, the Defendant has retaliated against the Plaintiff by threatening not to renew the lease, citing the late rent payment as the reason, despite the evident code violations and habitability issues that remain unaddressed.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. The Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all residential leases in Massachusetts, as established under Massachusetts common law and statutory provisions, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in their favor against the Defendant as follows:

1. Damages in the amount of $800 for the property damage and increased electric bills caused by the Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

2. Equitable relief as deemed just and proper by the Court.

3. Attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws governing landlord-tenant actions.

4. Any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
