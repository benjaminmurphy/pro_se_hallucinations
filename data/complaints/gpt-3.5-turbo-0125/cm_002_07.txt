Sarah Thompson,  
Plaintiff

v.

Jason Miller,  
Defendant

Case No: [Insert Case Number]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against Defendant Jason Miller, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Defendant, Jason Miller, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

3. The minor child subject to this action is Emily Miller, aged 8.

JURISDICTION

4. The Middlesex County Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, which grants authority over custody matters involving minor children in divorce and custody disputes.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On May 15, 2021, this Court entered an original custody order regarding the minor child, Emily Miller, granting primary custody to Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and providing visitation to Defendant, Jason Miller, every Wednesday and every other weekend.

6. Plaintiff and Defendant previously resided in the Cambridge area, where the custody order was implemented. The custody arrangement was designed with the assumption that both parties lived in close proximity, facilitating regular visitation.

7. Defendant, Jason Miller, now seeks to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while maintaining the same custody schedule, which would result in significant travel time for the minor child, Emily Miller. The proposed arrangement would entail lengthy drives, approximately ninety minutes each way, for midweek overnights, causing undue stress and anxiety for the child, who would have to return early in the morning to attend school the next day.

8. Due to the substantial distance between Plaintiff and Defendant's residences, the current visitation schedule is no longer feasible and in the best interests of the minor child.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to modify the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation requirement for Defendant and adjust the weekend visitation schedule to accommodate the parties' new living arrangements.

10. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody arrangement to promote the child's well-being by eliminating the undue burden of extended travel on school nights, ensuring a stable and consistent environment for Emily Miller.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court:

a. Modifies the existing custody order to eliminate midweek overnight visitation;

b. Adjusts the visitation schedule to better suit the parties' current living situation;

c. Grants such other relief as this Court deems just and appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,
