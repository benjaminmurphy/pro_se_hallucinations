**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

**PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, Maria Gonzales, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

2. Defendant, Steven Thompson, is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000, and the subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the District Court as provided by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19.

4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court as the subject property is located in Worcester, MA.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff, Maria Gonzales, entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant, Steven Thompson, on June 1, 2022, for the rental of an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

6. Since approximately three months ago, Plaintiff has faced repeated issues with a mouse infestation in the kitchen of the leased premises. Despite notifying the Defendant of the issue, the Defendant's response has been inadequate.

7. The Defendant, after being informed of the infestation, placed a few traps, which caught only a minimal number of mice. Subsequently, the Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings in the kitchen, indicating an ongoing infestation issue.

8. The Plaintiff's concerns were further validated by the exterminator, who advised that the property needed more comprehensive treatment to address the infestation adequately. However, the Defendant refused to take necessary action, citing cost concerns.

9. As a result of the unresolved infestation, the Plaintiff has incurred damages, including the disposal of approximately $200 worth of contaminated food items and an additional $80 spent on purchasing plastic containers for food storage.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**

10. The Defendant's failure to address the persistent mouse infestation in the leased premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential lease agreement under Massachusetts law.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Gonzales requests that this Court:

1. Declare that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to address the mouse infestation adequately.

2. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $280 for losses incurred due to the infestation.

3. Order Defendant to take immediate and comprehensive measures to eliminate the mouse infestation from the leased premises.

4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all triable issues.

**RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,**
