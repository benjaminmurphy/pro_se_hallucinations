IN THE SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT

Emily Carter,
Plaintiff

v.

Robert Thompson,
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her complaint against the Defendant, Robert Thompson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144.

2. Defendant, Robert Thompson, is the landlord of the property located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Jurisdiction is proper in this court as the events giving rise to the claim occurred within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant for the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144, commencing on January 1, 2022.

5. Since approximately six months ago, the tenants occupying the premises above Plaintiff's unit have been consistently engaging in disruptive and excessively loud behavior, including but not limited to stomping, playing loud music late at night, and moving furniture during late hours.

6. Plaintiff has made multiple complaints to the Defendant regarding the noise disturbances caused by the upstairs tenants. The Defendant's response was inadequate, stating that he "can't control how people live."

7. Despite Plaintiff's efforts to address the issue directly with the upstairs tenants and through the Defendant, the noise disturbances persist, significantly impacting Plaintiff's ability to enjoy quiet and peaceful habitation of the leased premises.

8. Plaintiff, as a result of the ongoing disturbances, has been deprived of proper rest and sleep, leading to personal and professional consequences. Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk, and has incurred expenses for sleep medication amounting to $40 per month.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff asserts a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14. This breach has caused Plaintiff substantial and ongoing harm, including but not limited to disruption of peaceful habitation, loss of sleep, financial expenses, and professional repercussions.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Declare that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $1,200, representing past and ongoing harm resulting from the breach;
c. Order Defendant to take all necessary actions to abate the noise disturbances caused by the upstairs tenants; and
d. Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
