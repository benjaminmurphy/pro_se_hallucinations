Plaintiff                                         

v.                                         

Mark Johnson                                         
Defendant                                         

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER                                         

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order, states as follows:                                         

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and the Defendant, Mark Johnson, are the parents of Emily Johnson, a minor child born on [Child's Date of Birth].                                         

2. On June 15, 2020, this Honorable Court entered a Judgment establishing custody arrangements between the parties. Pursuant to said Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody, with the Plaintiff designated as the primary residential parent. The Defendant enjoys substantial weekend visitation, including overnight stays on Sundays.                                         

3. The Plaintiff avers that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original Judgment, warranting a modification of the custody order.                                         

4. The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant has been consistently keeping Emily home from school on Mondays following their weekend visitations, claiming it to be for the child's mental health without providing any medical documentation. The Plaintiff further states that the Defendant has failed to adhere to school attendance commitments and has repeatedly refused to transport Emily to tutoring sessions falling within his visitation schedule. These actions have resulted in truancy warnings from the school, a decline in Emily's academic performance, and setbacks in her educational progress.                                         

5. The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to either grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding school attendance matters or to limit the Defendant's overnight visitations on school nights. Such modification is necessary to safeguard Emily's academic well-being and overall development.                                         

Wherefore, the Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court grants the following:                                         

a) Modification of the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority on school attendance decisions or to restrict the Defendant's overnight visitations on school nights;                                         

b) Such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.                                         

DATED: December 1, 2025.
