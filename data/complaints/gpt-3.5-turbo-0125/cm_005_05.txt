David Smith
Defendant

Complaint for Modification
Docket No. ________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, and files this Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, David Smith, and in support thereof states as follows:

1. PARTIES: The Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, is a resident of [Your City], [Your State]. The Defendant, David Smith, is a resident of [Defendant's City], [Your State].

2. JURISDICTION: This action is brought in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, as the Court having jurisdiction over custody matters concerning the parties' children, Emily Smith (age 10) and Jacob Smith (age 7).

3. BACKGROUND: On April 15, 2022, the Court entered an order granting joint legal custody with primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and a regular visitation schedule for the Defendant.

4. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES: Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances that warrants modification of the existing order. The Defendant has been engaging in conduct detrimental to the children's well-being by signing them up for activities during the Plaintiff's scheduled weekends without prior discussion, disparaging the Plaintiff to the children, and causing emotional distress to the children, as evidenced by one child's recurrent physical symptoms on transition days.

5. REQUESTED MODIFICATION: The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody arrangement to primary physical custody residing with the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith. Additionally, the Plaintiff requests clearer guidelines regarding scheduling decisions to prevent further disruptions and emotional harm to the children.

6. APPLICABLE LAW: Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances. In determining the best interests of the children, the Court considers factors such as the children's adjustment to their home, school, and community, the mental and physical health of all parties involved, and any history of abuse.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, and for such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

Jennifer Smith
