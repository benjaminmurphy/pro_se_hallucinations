IN THE BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT
ROXBURY DIVISION

Maya Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Richard Greene
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Maya Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Richard Greene, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maya Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. Defendant Richard Greene is the landlord of the aforementioned property located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of the landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant. The Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, has jurisdiction over this matter as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about February 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a studio apartment at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

5. During the showing of the apartment, Plaintiff noticed water stains on the ceiling. Defendant reassured Plaintiff that the stains were from an old leak that had been repaired.

6. Shortly after moving in, Plaintiff experienced water leaking through the ceiling during rainstorms, causing damage to personal property and creating a musty odor in the apartment.

7. Despite multiple complaints to Defendant, the issue remains unresolved, and the living conditions in the apartment have significantly deteriorated. Plaintiff has been forced to relocate furniture and avoid areas of the apartment due to the ongoing water intrusion issue.

8. The water intrusion has caused damage to Plaintiff's personal property, including a laptop costing approximately $900 to replace, and has led to health concerns such as headaches potentially related to mold exposure.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease under Massachusetts law. Defendant's failure to address and remedy the ongoing water intrusion issue has substantially interfered with Plaintiff's right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maya Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Richard Greene, awarding the following relief:

1. Damages in the amount of $900 for property damage.
2. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025
