Case No.:

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jordan Miller, by and through the undersigned legal assistant, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Alex Chen, states as follows:

[FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS]

1. The Plaintiff, Jordan Miller, was lawfully riding his bicycle in a marked bike lane on 200 Park Drive, Boston, MA 02215, on July 15, 2023.

2. While the Plaintiff was proceeding in the bike lane, the Defendant, Alex Chen, a rideshare driver, parked his vehicle in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.

3. Without checking his side mirror or ensuring the safety of passing cyclists, the Defendant suddenly swung open the door of his vehicle, causing the Plaintiff to crash into the edge of the door.

4. As a result of the collision, the Plaintiff suffered road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bicycle frame.

5. At the scene of the incident, the Defendant admitted that he did not see the Plaintiff because he was distracted by his phone, as confirmed by the Defendant's statement to the Plaintiff.

6. However, subsequent to the incident, the Defendant provided false and misleading information to his insurance company, alleging that the Plaintiff was "weaving in and out of traffic," which is categorically untrue.

[CAUSES OF ACTION]

7. The Defendant's actions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law, specifically M.G.L. c. 231, § 85, as he breached his duty of care owed to the Plaintiff by negligently opening his vehicle's door into the path of a cyclist.

8. The Defendant's negligence directly caused the Plaintiff's injuries and damages, including medical expenses of approximately $1,200, and lost wages totaling $600.

9. The Defendant's negligence further entitles the Plaintiff to seek compensatory damages under Massachusetts common law for the physical injuries, pain and suffering, and property damage sustained as a result of the Defendant's negligent actions.

[PRAYER FOR RELIEF]

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jordan Miller, respectfully prays for the following relief from this Honorable Court:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $1,800 for medical expenses and lost wages;
b. Compensatory damages for pain and suffering and property damage to be determined at trial;
c. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.
