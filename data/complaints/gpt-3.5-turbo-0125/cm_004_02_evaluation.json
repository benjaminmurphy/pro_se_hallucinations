Nothing in the decision addresses overnights, a parent's new residence, or standards for modifying custody in the child's best interests. Therefore it cannot be cited as authority for modifying a custody arrangement to include overnights at a new residence.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), alleging unequal compensation and termination of employment based on gender in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1). The complaint also included claims for defamation. Following a jury trial, Wal-Mart was found liable on the G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), claim, and the plaintiff was awarded $972,774 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages."
