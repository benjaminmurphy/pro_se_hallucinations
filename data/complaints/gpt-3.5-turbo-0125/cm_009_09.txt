Lisa Thompson, Plaintiff
v.
Mark Johnson, Defendant

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, residing at [Your Address], and alleges the following for Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Mark Johnson, residing at [Defendant's Address]:

1. The parties are the parents of Emma Johnson, an 8-year-old child, as identified in the original custody order dated January 15, 2019. The current custody arrangement grants primary custody to the Plaintiff, with the Defendant receiving visitation every other weekend and a midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

2. The Plaintiff asserts that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances warranting a modification of the existing custody order. Specifically, the Defendant has since relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the child's school and primary residence. Despite this significant change in location, the Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight visitation, resulting in Emma being subjected to overly strenuous and exhausting travel arrangements. The Plaintiff contends that this arrangement is negatively impacting the child's well-being, as evidenced by her decreased energy levels and diminished academic performance on Thursdays after the midweek visits.

3. The Plaintiff seeks to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and to adjust the weekend schedule to ensure that Emma is not subjected to extensive and disruptive travel on school nights, thereby promoting her physical and emotional well-being.

4. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the existing custody arrangement to reflect the aforementioned changes in the best interests of the child.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:

1. Modification of the current custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation;
2. Adjustment of the weekend schedule to ensure the child's well-being is prioritized; and
3. Any further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
