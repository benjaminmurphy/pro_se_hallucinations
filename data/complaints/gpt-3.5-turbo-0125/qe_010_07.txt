PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Thompson, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. The Defendant, Sarah Bennett, is the landlord of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 21, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000.

4. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852, commencing on May 1, 2022.

6. Plaintiff pays $1200 per month in rent to Defendant.

7. On an unspecified date, Plaintiff noticed mold growth in the bathroom of the rented premises, starting in the corner of the shower and spreading to the ceiling.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold issue, and Defendant inspected the bathroom but unfairly attributed the problem to Plaintiff's alleged inadequate use of the exhaust fan and hot showers.

9. Plaintiff denies negligently contributing to the mold growth, as she adequately uses the exhaust fan during showers and maintains normal showering habits.

10. In addition to the mold infestation, Plaintiff has suffered respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, since the appearance of mold, as confirmed by medical diagnosis tying the health problems to the mold exposure.

11. Plaintiff was forced to discard a shower curtain and towels tainted by mold, incurring a financial loss of approximately $60.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. Defendant's failure to remediate the mold infestation constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as recognized under Massachusetts law.

13. Massachusetts law imposes an implied warranty of habitability on landlords, including the duty to provide and maintain premises free from mold and other harmful conditions. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 N.E.2d 1155 (Mass. 1977).

14. Defendant's refusal to address the mold issue and the resulting health effects on Plaintiff violate the aforementioned implied warranty and Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Declare that Defendant's actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

b. Order Defendant to remediate the mold infestation in the bathroom promptly;

c. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $150 for consequential losses and medical expenses;

d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
