Laura Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Reed
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes Laura Thompson, the Plaintiff in the above-entitled action, and complains against the Defendant, Michael Reed, as follows:

1. The parties to this action are Laura Thompson, residing at [Your Address], and Michael Reed, residing at [Defendant's Address].

2. The parties are the parents of a minor child, Emily Thompson, born on [date of birth].

3. The original Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time was entered on March 15, 2021, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

4. Pursuant to the current judgment, the parties share legal custody of the minor child, with Laura Thompson designated as the primary residential parent, and Michael Reed having substantial weekend parenting time that includes overnights on Sunday nights. The parties are required to cooperate on school matters as outlined in the current judgment.

5. Since the entry of the original judgment, there have been significant changes in circumstances regarding the minor child's school attendance and academic performance.

6. On multiple occasions over the past year, Michael Reed has kept the minor child home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, without providing any medical or legitimate reason. This pattern of unauthorized absences has resulted in truancy warnings from the school and a decline in the minor child's academic performance, evidenced by lower grades and test scores.

7. Furthermore, Michael Reed has consistently failed to support the minor child's educational needs by refusing to ensure her attendance at tutoring sessions scheduled during his parenting time.

8. These actions by Michael Reed have had a detrimental impact on the minor child's education and well-being.

9. Therefore, Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the current custody order to either grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding the minor child's school attendance or adjust Michael Reed's parenting time to remove overnight stays on school nights.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the current custody order to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority on school attendance matters or adjust Michael Reed's parenting time as appropriate.

2. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
Laura Thompson, Plaintiff
Date: December 1, 2025
