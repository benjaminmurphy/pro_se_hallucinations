4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, Section 3, and Chapter 231, Section 6.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire Superior Court under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 223, Section 2, as the incident occurred at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was walking on the sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA, when a large branch of a maple tree on the property owned by the Defendant suddenly broke and fell, striking the Plaintiff on the shoulder and back.

7. Prior to the branch falling, concerned neighbors had warned the Defendant about the cracked and droopy appearance of the branch, suggesting that he seek professional inspection and timely action to address the dangerous condition.

8. The Defendant assured the neighbors that he would address the issue in the spring but neglected to take any action prior to the incident.

9. As a result of the fallen branch, the Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain and extensive bruising, necessitating medical treatment and causing her to miss approximately one week of work.

10. The Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $600 in wages due to the injuries sustained.

11. The Defendant's failure to adequately address the known hazardous condition of the tree branch amounted to negligence, resulting in harm to the Plaintiff.

CAUSE OF ACTION

12. The Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain the trees on his property in a safe condition to prevent harm to individuals lawfully using the adjacent sidewalk.

13. The Defendant breached this duty by failing to address the hazardous condition of the tree branch after receiving warnings and assurances by neighbors about the potential danger it posed.

14. The Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff's injuries and resulting damages.

15. Based on the foregoing, the Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for negligence against the Defendant.
