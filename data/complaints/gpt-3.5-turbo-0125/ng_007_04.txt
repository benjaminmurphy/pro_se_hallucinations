BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER, Defendant

COMPLAINT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Michael Johnson, by and through the undersigned, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Michael Johnson, is an individual residing at [Address], Brockton, MA.

2. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is an entity located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301, providing after-school programs for children.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court as the events giving rise to this action occurred at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at the Defendant's premises located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA, Plaintiff's eight-year-old son was enrolled in an after-school program supervised by the Defendant.

6. Despite the Defendant's representation that children would be supervised at all times in the gym, on the aforementioned date, one of the two staff members responsible for supervision left to attend to paperwork in the office.

7. The remaining staff member, instead of actively monitoring the children, was distracted and engaged with her phone near the bleachers.

8. Two older children began playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor, which was observed by other children who then reported the situation to the staff member in question.

9. Despite being notified of the reckless and dangerous behavior, the staff member nonchalantly dismissed the concerns with the statement "boys will be boys."

10. As a result of the staff's negligent supervision, one of the older children forcefully tackled Plaintiff's eight-year-old son, causing him to hit his head on the floor. The impact rendered the Plaintiff's son unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.

11. Subsequently, Plaintiff's son was rushed to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion, leading to medical expenses amounting to approximately $5,500. Additionally, the Plaintiff lost $1,200 in wages due to caring for his injured son.

CAUSES OF ACTION

12. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, owed a duty of care to Plaintiff's son as a result of supervising him in its after-school program.

13. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to provide adequate supervision, allowing a dangerous activity to take place, and disregarding reports of risky conduct by the children.

14. The Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff's son's injuries and resulting damages.

15. The Defendant's actions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law.
