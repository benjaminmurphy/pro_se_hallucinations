Quincy Bistro
Defendant

Case No.: ___________

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and complains against the Defendant, Quincy Bistro, as follows:

JURISDICTION AND PARTIES

1. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, section 3.

2. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

3. The Defendant, Quincy Bistro, is a business entity registered in the state of Massachusetts located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On September 15, 2023, at Quincy Bistro located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169, the Defendant's employee negligently dropped a tray with water glasses in the hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, resulting in a spill on the tile floor.

5. After cleaning up the broken glass, the employee failed to promptly address the water spill by leaving the water and ice on the tile floor, without warning or placing a wet floor sign.

6. Approximately ten minutes later, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, unwittingly stepped on the wet floor while attempting to access the restroom, resulting in a slip and fall incident which caused her to twist her knee.

7. The Plaintiff sustained a sprained knee as a direct result of the Defendant’s negligence, requiring medical treatment, a knee brace, and subsequent physical therapy for weeks.

8. It has come to light that other staff members were aware of the hazardous condition of the wet floor and had been avoiding the area without proper remedial actions.

CAUSES OF ACTION

9. The Defendant owed a duty of care to its patrons, including the Plaintiff, to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition.

10. The Defendant breached its duty of care by negligently allowing a hazardous condition to exist in its establishment without proper warnings or timely clean-up.

11. The negligence of the Defendant was the proximate cause of the Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Award damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $3,500, which includes medical expenses of approximately $2,000 and lost wages of approximately $1,500;

b. Award prejudgment interest and costs as permitted under Massachusetts law;

c. Grant any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

Respectfully submitted,
