v.
Michael Johnson, Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION
Case No. [to be assigned by the court]

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification against Defendant Michael Johnson, respectfully states as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is the mother of Liam Thompson, born on [DOB - Liam], and Ava Thompson, born on [DOB - Ava], minors subject to a custody order issued by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2021.
2. Defendant, Michael Johnson, is the father of Liam Thompson and Ava Thompson.
3. The appropriate Family Court for this action is the Norfolk Probate and Family Court.

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
4. Pursuant to the existing custody order, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Liam and Ava, while Defendant has visitation rights on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.
5. Since the entry of the initial custody order, Defendant has entered into a relationship with an individual who has a documented criminal record for assault and battery and a history of restraining orders from previous partners.
6. The individual in question has been observed engaging in violent behavior, including yelling, slamming doors, and physically assaulting one of the minor children to the extent of leaving visible marks on the child's arm.
7. On a particular occasion, the police were called to the residence during a heated argument in the presence of the minor children, further illustrating the unsafe environment to which the children are exposed during visitation with Defendant.
8. The safety and well-being of Liam and Ava are of paramount concern to Plaintiff, and it is imperative that modifications to the existing custody arrangement are warranted to protect the children from potential harm and emotional distress.

III. REQUESTED RELIEF
9. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to ensure the safety and welfare of the minor children by:
   a. Restricting the presence of the individual with the criminal history during visitation with Defendant; or
   b. Mandating supervised visitation when the minor children are in the care of Defendant.
10. Plaintiff further requests such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

IV. JURISDICTION
11. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter X, Section 1, governing family law matters.

V. VERIFICATION
12. Plaintiff affirms under the penalties of perjury that the foregoing representations are true and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the requested modification to the existing custody order in the best interest of Liam and Ava.

Dated: December 1, 2025
