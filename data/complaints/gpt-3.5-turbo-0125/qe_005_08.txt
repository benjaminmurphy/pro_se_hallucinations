IN THE SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT

Jordan Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Richards
Defendant

CASE NO.:

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant Michael Richards, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02144.

2. Defendant Michael Richards is the landlord of the aforementioned premises and is duly authorized to do business in Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action as the subject matter of the Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of the Somerville District Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court as the premises subject to the lease agreement, which is the basis of this action, is located in Somerville, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent the residential premises at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02144, commencing on May 1, 2022, for a monthly rent of $1,800.

6. Despite the lease provision guaranteeing Plaintiff the right to "quiet enjoyment" of the premises, Plaintiff has been subjected to continuous and excessive noise disturbances emanating from the tenants occupying the unit above him since their arrival approximately six months ago.

7. The noise disturbances include loud stomping, late-night music playing, and sounds resembling furniture movement at unreasonable hours, severely disrupting Plaintiff's peace and quiet.

8. Plaintiff has made repeated complaints to Defendant about the noise issues but has received inadequate response and resolution. Defendant's response that he "can't control how people live" fails to address the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff.

9. As a direct result of the constant noise disturbances, Plaintiff's sleep has been significantly disrupted, leading to adverse consequences such as falling asleep at work, being issued a written warning, and incurring medical expenses for sleep medication amounting to $40 per month.

10. Despite Plaintiff's efforts to mitigate the noise by purchasing earplugs, a white noise machine, and attempting to rearrange his bedroom, the level of disturbances persists, depriving Plaintiff of the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of his rented premises.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Plaintiff hereby alleges a single cause of action against Defendant for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, citing Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, which imposes an implied obligation on landlords to provide tenants with quiet enjoyment of their leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Thompson respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

a. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff for damages in an amount to be proven at trial but not less than $3,600;
b. Injunctive relief requiring Defendant to take immediate measures to abate the noise disturbances causing the breach of quiet enjoyment; and
c. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted on this 1st day of December, 2025.
