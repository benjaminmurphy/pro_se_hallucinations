IN THE DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK
CHELSEA DIVISION

---

Emily Santos,
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Thompson,
Defendant

---

COMPLAINT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Santos, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Santos, is an individual residing at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA.

2. The Defendant, Michael Thompson, is the landlord of the property at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction over this matter is proper in the Chelsea District Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about 2022-06-01, the Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with the Defendant for the property located at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA.

5. The Plaintiff has been experiencing ongoing issues with the security of the property, specifically with the main entry door which has a broken lock that does not properly secure the building.

6. Despite multiple notifications from the Plaintiff to the Defendant regarding the broken lock, the Defendant has failed to take any action to repair it.

7. As a result of the broken lock, unauthorized individuals have gained access to the building, leading to incidents of theft and trespassing. The Plaintiff had a package worth $120 stolen from the hallway due to the inadequate security measures.

8. Additionally, the Plaintiff has discovered evidence of someone unlawfully residing in the basement of the property, causing further concerns for her safety and security.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. The Defendant's failure to address and remedy the security issues with the property constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all residential leases under Massachusetts law.

10. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14 provides that a landlord must maintain premises in habitable condition, including providing adequate security measures.

11. Case law in Massachusetts, such as Pugh v. Holmes, 253 Mass 115 (1925), holds that a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when a landlord fails to address security issues that affect a tenant's enjoyment of the property.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, as follows:

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $320 for losses incurred due to the security breaches.
2. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.
