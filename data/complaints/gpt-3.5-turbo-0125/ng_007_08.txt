Jason Smith, Plaintiff

v.

Brockton Community Center, Defendant

---------------------------------------------------------x

COMPLAINT

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jason Smith, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jason Smith, is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City], Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a community center located at 45 Thatcher St, Brockton, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On September 15, 2023, at approximately [time], at the premises located at 45 Thatcher St, Brockton, MA, the Plaintiff's minor son was attending an after-school program provided by the Defendant.

4. Despite the Defendant's representation that children would be supervised at all times in the gym area, on the aforementioned date, the Plaintiff's son, along with other children, were not adequately supervised.

5. Specifically, on that date, there were supposed to be two staff members supervising approximately twenty children, but one of the staff members left the gym area to engage in administrative tasks, and the remaining staff member was not actively supervising the children but was instead using a phone near the bleachers.

6. In the absence of proper supervision and control, two older boys engaged in a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor, wherein the Plaintiff's eight-year-old son, who is small for his age, was tackled forcefully by one of the older boys, causing the Plaintiff's son to hit his head on the floor and lose consciousness for an estimated thirty seconds.

7. As a direct result of the Defendant's negligent supervision and control, the Plaintiff's son sustained a concussion, leading to medical expenses of approximately $4,500 and necessitating the Plaintiff's son to miss several days of school.

COUNT

8. The Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff's son, as a business inviting children onto its premises, to provide adequate and competent supervision to ensure the safety and well-being of the children present.

9. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to provide proper and adequate supervision, allowing for a dangerous activity to occur, resulting in the Plaintiff's son suffering injuries and damages.

10. The Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff's son's injuries and resultant damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against the Defendant for:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $4,500 for medical expenses incurred;
b. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
