IN THE WORCESTER PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
COUNTY OF WORCESTER  
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  

Jessica Turner,  
Plaintiff  
v.  
Michael Turner,   
Defendant  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint for Modification of Custody Order against the Defendant, Michael Turner, alleges as follows:

I. PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an adult resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Turner, is an adult resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 209, Section 38, which grants the Probate and Family Court jurisdiction over actions for modification of custody.

4. Venue is proper in Worcester County as this is the county where the original custody order was entered and where the child primarily resides.

III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On March 15, 2018, the Worcester Probate and Family Court entered a custody order granting primary residence to the Defendant, Michael Turner, and providing limited weekend time and one weeknight dinner with the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner.

6. At the time the original custody order was entered, the Plaintiff was in graduate school, residing in a small studio apartment, and had limited flexibility in her schedule. Thus, the custody arrangement reflected those circumstances.

7. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances. The Plaintiff has completed her education, secured stable employment with predictable hours, and now resides in a two-bedroom apartment where the child, Emily Turner, has her own room.

8. The child, Emily Turner, aged 10, has developed a close bond with the Plaintiff and expressed a desire for increased time spent with her mother. Emily's therapist has indicated that the current custody arrangement causes the child distress and feelings of guilt, and it is in the child's best interest to have more time with the Plaintiff.

9. Despite the child's expressed wishes and the professional recommendations, the Defendant has refused to engage in discussions or consider modifications to the custody arrangement.

IV. REQUEST FOR RELIEF  

10. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to allow for an increased amount of parenting time with the child, Emily Turner, to better serve her best interests and accommodate the significant changes in circumstances since the entry of the original order.

V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, prays for the following relief from this Honorable Court:

a. Modify the existing custody order to increase the Plaintiff's parenting time with the child, Emily Turner, in accordance with her best interests;

b. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
