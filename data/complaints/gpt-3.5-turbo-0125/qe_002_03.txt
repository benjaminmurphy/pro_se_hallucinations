IN THE BOSTON HOUSING COURT

JORDAN MITCHELL,
Plaintiff

v.

SAMANTHA BAKER,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant Samantha Baker ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell, is a tenant residing at 24-26 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, under a lease agreement commencing on March 1, 2022.

2. Defendant, Samantha Baker, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

3. Plaintiff pays Defendant monthly rent of $1200.

4. On or about October 15, 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent due to unforeseen medical expenses. Plaintiff remedied the late payment by paying the rent along with the late fee.

5. In November 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of water seepage issues through the basement wall during heavy rainfalls. Defendant acknowledged the issue but failed to take appropriate action to address the water intrusion.

6. As a result of Defendant's inaction, the water seepage caused damage to Plaintiff's personal property, namely a rug and a bookshelf, totaling approximately $400.

7. Additionally, the water seepage necessitated Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier continuously, leading to increased electric bills.

8. After a city inspection in November 2025, it was revealed that the property had various code violations, including the water seepage issue.

9. Despite the complaints made by Plaintiff regarding the water intrusion and code violations, Defendant labeled Plaintiff as a "problem tenant" and informed Plaintiff of the non-renewal of the lease upon its expiration in March 2026.

10. Plaintiff believes that Defendant's decision not to renew the lease is retaliatory and based on Plaintiff's complaints and the city inspection findings, rather than the previous late rent payment.

11. The aforementioned actions of Defendant constitute a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14, which guarantees tenants the right to peaceful and quiet possession of their rented premises.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell respectfully prays for relief as follows:

a. Damages in the amount of $400 for the damaged personal property;
b. Reimbursement for the increased electric bills incurred due to the water seepage issue; 
c. Injunctive relief compelling Defendant to address and rectify the water seepage issue and other code violations promptly; and
d. Any further relief deemed just and equitable by this Honorable Court.

Respectfully submitted,
