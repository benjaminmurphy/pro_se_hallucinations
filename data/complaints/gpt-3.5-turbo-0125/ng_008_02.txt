v.

Café Delight
Defendant

COMPLAINT

Now comes Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant, Café Delight, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip].

2. Defendant Café Delight is a business located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction of this Court is proper pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in Norfolk County where the cause of action arose.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, at the premises of Café Delight located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169, Plaintiff was a patron having dinner.

6. While walking in the narrow hallway connecting the kitchen and dining area, Plaintiff slipped on a wet tile floor due to spilled water and ice, which had not been cleaned or marked with a warning sign despite a server dropping a tray of water glasses.

7. The server picked up the broken glass but failed to promptly clean up the water spill, stating she would return with a mop.

8. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff, in good faith, attempted to walk through the hallway to use the restroom, unaware of the hidden danger, and slipped as a result of the unmarked wet floor, causing a severe knee injury.

9. Other staff members confirmed they had been aware of the hazardous condition in the hallway but neglected to take appropriate measures to prevent injuries.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant Café Delight owed a duty of care to its patrons, including Plaintiff, to maintain safe premises free from dangerous conditions. The failure to promptly clean up the water spill and warn of the slippery floor constitutes negligence as defined by Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $3,700, including medical expenses of $2,500 and lost wages of $1,200;

b. Interest as allowed by law;

c. Costs and attorney fees pursuant to Massachusetts law; and

d. Any further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Respectfully submitted on this 1st day of December, 2025.
