Jessica Collins
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Smith
Defendant

Complaint for Modification

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Smith, alleges and states as follows:

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, is the mother of Ethan (8 years old) and Emma (6 years old), who are the subject of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on June 15, 2020.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is the father of the aforementioned minor children and is the co-parent with the Plaintiff under the current custody arrangement.

3. The existing custody arrangement provides for joint custody with the Plaintiff having primary care of the children, while the Defendant exercises custody every other weekend and one overnight on weekdays.

4. Recently, a significant change in circumstances has occurred warranting modification of the existing custody order. Specifically, the Defendant has taken on a new job with hours that conflict with the existing custody schedule. The Defendant now works from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week, including the nights when he is scheduled to have overnight custody of the children.

5. As a result of his new work schedule, the Defendant has been unable to fulfill his custodial responsibilities adequately. The Defendant frequently drops off the children at the Plaintiff's residence with little notice, leaves the children with a roommate without the Plaintiff's consent, and allows the children to fall asleep unsupervised while he rests after work.

6. This change in circumstances has resulted in the children experiencing unstable and unsafe living conditions during the Defendant's custodial time, which is not in their best interests.

7. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to ensure that overnights with the Defendant only occur when he is available and able to provide proper care and supervision for the children.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to reflect the changes in circumstances detailed herein, specifically to amend the custody schedule to align with the Defendant's availability when he is not working. The Plaintiff also requests such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature]
