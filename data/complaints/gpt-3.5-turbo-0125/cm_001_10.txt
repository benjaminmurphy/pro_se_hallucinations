SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS

Plaintiff: Lisa McKenzie
v.
Defendant: Mark Johnson

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

Now comes the Plaintiff, Lisa McKenzie, and for her Complaint for Modification of Custody Order against the Defendant, Mark Johnson, alleges as follows:

1. The parties are the parents of two children, Emma Johnson (8) and Noah Johnson (6).
2. The original custody order dated May 15, 2020, established a parenting schedule where Lisa has primary custody, and Mark has visitation every other weekend and one overnight during the week.
3. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the issuance of the original custody order, warranting a modification of the current visitation schedule.
4. Specifically, the Defendant, Mark Johnson, recently took on a new job working from 7 PM to 7 AM several nights a week, including nights when he is scheduled to have overnight visitation with the children.
5. Due to his work schedule, Mark has been unable to adequately care for the children during his scheduled overnight visitation. The children have reported falling asleep unsupervised on the couch while their father naps after returning home from work, or being left in the care of unfamiliar individuals, such as Mark's roommate.
6. These circumstances pose a risk to the well-being and safety of the children and are not in their best interests.
7. Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to modify the current visitation schedule to ensure that overnight visitation occurs only when the Defendant is available to actively care for the children and not working during the scheduled overnight hours.
8. Plaintiff seeks an order modifying the custody order to reflect the desired changes in the visitation schedule for the best interests of the children.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court grants the modification of the custody order in accordance with the above-stated allegations.

DATED: December 1, 2025
