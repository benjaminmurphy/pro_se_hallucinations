Plaintiff

v.

Brockton Community Center
Defendant

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Lucas Thompson, and for his Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Lucas Thompson is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip].

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center is an entity located at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the incident giving rise to this action occurred within its jurisdictional limits.

4. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court as the Defendant is located in Brockton.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at the premises of the Brockton Community Center located at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, MA, Plaintiff's minor child was participating in an after-school program supervised by the Defendant.

6. Despite the Defendant's representation that children would be supervised at all times, on the aforementioned date, there was inadequate supervision in the gym area where approximately twenty children were present.

7. One of the staff members left the gym area to attend to administrative tasks, leaving the sole remaining staff member preoccupied with a phone near the bleachers.

8. Two older children engaged in a rough tackle game on the gym's hardwood floor, despite complaints from other children to the staff member. The staff member dismissed the complaints with the statement "boys will be boys."

9. As a result of the inadequate supervision and reckless disregard for the safety of the children, Plaintiff's eight-year-old child, who is small for his age, was tackled forcefully by one of the older children, causing him to hit his head on the floor and lose consciousness.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant owed a duty of care to the children under its supervision at the community center, including Plaintiff's child, to provide adequate supervision and ensure their safety.

11. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to provide adequate supervision, allowing unsafe activities to occur, and failing to prevent hazardous conduct by older children in the absence of proper supervision.

12. Defendant's negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's child's injuries, including a concussion and loss of consciousness, resulting in medical expenses of approximately $5,200 and lost wages of $1,500 for Plaintiff.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Lucas Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Brockton Community Center, and grant the following relief:

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $6,700 for medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;
2. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
3. Costs and disbursements incurred in this action; and
4. Any other relief this Court deems just and proper.
