Jordan Smith  
Plaintiff 

v. 

Lynn Apartment Management, LLC  
Defendant 

COMPLAINT 

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Smith, brings this action against Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, LLC, for negligence arising out of an incident that occurred at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA 01905 on September 15, 2023.

2. Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, LLC, as the landlord of the apartment building located at the aforementioned address, had a duty to maintain functioning smoke detectors in the common hallways of the building, including the hallway outside Plaintiff's unit.

3. For several months prior to the incident, the smoke detector located outside Plaintiff's unit was emitting a chirping sound due to a low battery. Despite Plaintiff's repeated notifications to the landlord, Defendant failed to promptly replace the battery, resulting in an inoperable smoke detector in violation of Massachusetts regulations (see M.G.L. Ch. 148, § 26F).

4. On the night of September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment at the building, causing smoke to fill the common hallway. Due to the non-functioning smoke detector, Plaintiff did not receive timely warning of the fire and was only alerted by the smell of smoke. As a result, Plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation injuries that required hospital treatment.

5. The negligence of Defendant in failing to maintain the smoke detector resulted in Plaintiff incurring approximately $12,000 in medical expenses and $2,500 in lost wages.

6. Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for negligence against Defendant based on the duty owed to tenants to maintain safe premises and ensure the proper functioning of safety devices, the breach of that duty by Defendant in failing to address the defective smoke detector promptly, and the resulting harm suffered by Plaintiff due to such negligence.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Smith respectfully requests the following relief from the Court:

a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $14,500;
b. Prejudgment interest as allowed by law;
c. Costs and attorney fees pursuant to statute.

Jordan Smith
