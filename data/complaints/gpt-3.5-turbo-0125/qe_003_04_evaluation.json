Boston Housing Auth.) concerns negligence and the duty of a landowner toward a trespasser who becomes helplessly trapped, not breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment or G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. It does not analyze landlord\u2013tenant warranty or quiet enjoyment concepts, habitability, or water leakage issues; instead it focuses on tort duties, wilful/wanton conduct, and reasonable care. Therefore it does not support the specific proposition about a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment due to unremedied water leakage, and Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway is not actually quoted or applied here.",

We reject any notion that this is a duty which can never be violated by nonfeasance. The owner in such a situation is required to act if, in the same circumstances, an ordinary and reasonably prudent person would have acted\u2026\u201d"

It does not involve a landlord-tenant relationship, water leakage, or the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Accordingly, it provides no authority for the proposition about breach of quiet enjoyment due to failure to repair water leaks.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Concerning the merits, we affirm the judgment on the grounds set forth in the well-reasoned memorandum of decision written by the Superior Court judge. As that memorandum states, there is no occasion for invoking the formidable equitable remedy of rescission for the reason, if no other, that the defendant, in accordance with its June 11, 1986, agreement with the plaintiffs, exercised its right to tender full payment of the promissory note dated July 16, 1976, a tender which the plaintiffs spurned."
