**IN THE DISTRICT COURT**

**Jessica Martin**
Plaintiff

v.

**Thomas Reynolds**
Defendant

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

**Introduction**

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, brings this action against Defendant, Thomas Reynolds, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of Massachusetts law.

**Parties**

2. Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, is a resident of 250 Main St, Brockton, MA 02301.

3. Defendant, Thomas Reynolds, is the landlord of the property located at 250 Main St, Brockton, MA 02301.

**Jurisdiction and Venue**

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 19.

5. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

**Factual Allegations**

6. On January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 250 Main St, Brockton, MA 02301.

7. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff's apartment ceased functioning.

8. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the issue on the same day.

9. Defendant acknowledged the problem and informed Plaintiff that a part for the water heater needed replacement. Defendant assured Plaintiff that the part was on order.

10. Despite Defendant's assurances, as of December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been deprived of hot water for over three weeks.

11. Plaintiff was forced to incur additional expenses, including but not limited to $30 per month for gym shower usage and extra gas costs to get there. Additionally, Plaintiff had to take her baby to her mother's house for baths due to the lack of hot water in the apartment.

**Legal Basis**

12. Defendant's failure to provide Plaintiff with a habitable living environment and necessary utilities, specifically hot water, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as outlined in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

13. The case law in **Pines v. Persiani**, 885 N.E.2d 426 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008), supports the position that the warranty of habitability includes the provision of essential services such as hot water.

**Cause of Action**

14. Plaintiff alleges a single cause of action: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment.

**Prayer for Relief**

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to:

a. Order Defendant to immediately repair the hot water system in Plaintiff's apartment;

b. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $600 for additional expenses incurred;

c. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

**Jury Demand**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all triable issues.

**Dated:** December 1, 2025

**Respectfully submitted,**
