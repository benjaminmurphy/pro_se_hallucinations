COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Johnson, by and through undersigned counsel, and in support of her complaint against Defendant Robert Thompson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at [Your Address], [City, State, Zip Code].

2. Defendant Robert Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the cause of action occurred within the jurisdiction of the Berkshire Superior Court.

4. Venue is proper in Berkshire County as the incident giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Johnson was walking on the sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

6. At the time of the incident, Defendant Robert Thompson owned and controlled the property where a large old maple tree with a cracked and droopy branch overhung the sidewalk.

7. Despite being aware of the dangerous condition of the cracked branch, Defendant Thompson neglected to take any action to remedy the situation, despite being warned by neighbors to have it inspected by an arborist.

8. On that fateful day, during a regular summer thunderstorm, the cracked branch suddenly broke off and fell onto Plaintiff Johnson, causing her to sustain a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.

11. Defendant breached this duty by failing to address the known hazard of the cracked and droopy tree branch.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered injuries, incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500, and lost wages amounting to approximately $500.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for damages in the amount of $3,000, plus any additional damages as proven at trial;
