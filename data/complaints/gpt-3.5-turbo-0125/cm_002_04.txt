Middlesex Probate and Family Court  
Cambridge Division  

Maria Torres,  
Plaintiff  

v.  

James Carter,  
Defendant  

Docket No.:  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

I. Parties  

1. The Plaintiff, Maria Torres, resides at [Your Address], Cambridge, MA, 02139.  
2. The Defendant, James Carter, resides at [Defendant's Address], Cambridge, MA, [Defendant's ZIP Code].  

II. Jurisdiction and Venue  

3. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, and is the appropriate venue as the original custody order was entered by this Court on May 15, 2021.  

III. Factual Allegations  

4. Maria Torres and James Carter are the parents of Sophia Carter, born on [Child's Date of Birth], who is currently nine years old.  
5. Pursuant to the original custody order dated May 15, 2021, Maria Torres has primary custody of Sophia, and James Carter has visitation rights every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.  
6. James Carter seeks to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity while maintaining the existing custody schedule, which includes Sophia spending midweek overnights with him, necessitating a round-trip drive of approximately ninety minutes each way.  
7. The proposed arrangement will cause undue stress and anxiety for Sophia due to the long drives, frequent disruptions to her after-school activities, and early wake-up times on school mornings following midweek overnights.  
   
IV. Grounds for Modification  

8. The Plaintiff avers that a material change in circumstances has occurred necessitating a modification of the current custody order, specifically the relocation of the Defendant to New Hampshire, which renders the existing schedule unworkable and detrimental to the well-being of the child.  
9. This requested modification is in the best interests of the child to maintain stability, minimize disruption to her daily routine, and preserve her emotional and physical well-being.  

V. Requested Relief  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for the following relief:  
10. Modify the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation with James Carter;  
11. Adjust the weekend visitation schedule to accommodate the distance between the parties' residences;  
12. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  

VI. Prayer for Relief  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the existing custody order as set forth above and grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
