Laura Smith
Plaintiff  
v.  
Michael Johnson  
Defendant  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Johnson, alleges as follows:

1. The parties are the parents of Emily Johnson, born on [Child's Date of Birth].

2. On August 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting the Plaintiff primary custody of the minor child and providing the Defendant with visitation every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

3. Since the entry of the aforementioned custody order, a substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred that affects the best interests of the minor child.

4. The Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety miles away from the Plaintiff's residence.

5. The midweek overnight visitation ordered under the current arrangement involves a lengthy commute for the minor child on a school night, causing undue stress and exhaustion. The child's academic performance and overall well-being are being negatively impacted as a result.

6. Citing Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 28, which allows for modification of custody orders when there is a substantial and material change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the child, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and adjust the weekend schedule accordingly.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests the following relief:

a. Modification of the current custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation provision;
b. Such further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,
