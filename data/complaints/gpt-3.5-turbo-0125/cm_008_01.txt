v.

Michael Smith
[His Address]

Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Smith, states as follows:

1. The Parties

1.1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee (hereinafter "Plaintiff"), is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

1.2. The Defendant, Michael Smith (hereinafter "Defendant"), is also a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. Background

2.1. The parties are the parents of Emily Smith, a 10-year-old child.

2.2. On May 15, 2022, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment awarding Jennifer Lee primary residential custody of Emily, with the parties sharing legal custody. The current arrangement grants Michael Smith substantial weekend time, including Sunday night stays.

3. Factual Allegations

3.1. Since the issuance of the original custody order, Defendant has regularly chosen to keep Emily home from school on Mondays following their weekend visitation, citing the need for a "mental health day." Defendant has failed to provide any medical documentation supporting the necessity of these absences.

3.2. The frequent absences have led to truancy warnings from the school and a significant decline in Emily's academic performance, as evidenced by her diminishing grades and test scores.

3.3. Defendant has also refused to allow Emily to attend tutoring sessions scheduled during his custodial weekends, impeding Emily's educational progress.

4. Requested Modification

Plaintiff requests the following modifications to the existing custody order:

4.1. Grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding school attendance decisions for Emily; or

4.2. In the alternative, reduce Defendant's weekday overnight visitation to mitigate the negative impact on Emily's education.

5. Legal Arguments

The requested modification is warranted due to a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order. Massachusetts law recognizes that modifications to custody orders are appropriate when such changes affect the child's best interests. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28, Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), etc.

6. Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order as detailed above and grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DATED: December 1, 2025
