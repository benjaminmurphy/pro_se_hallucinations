IN THE DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE COUNTY OF PLYMOUTH
BROCKTON, MASSACHUSETTS

MARIA LOPEZ,    
Plaintiff     

v.    

JOHN HARRISON,     
Defendant    

CASE NO.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Maria Lopez, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant John Harrison, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maria Lopez is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301.

2. Defendant John Harrison is the landlord of the aforementioned premises.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185C, § 16A which grants jurisdiction to district courts over landlord-tenant disputes, as well as under applicable principles of common law.

4. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court where the premises subject to this action are located.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301, commencing on June 1, 2022, and paying $1200 per month in rent.

6. On or about November 10, 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the hot water in the rented premises had ceased functioning. Defendant acknowledged the issue and assured Plaintiff that a necessary part for the water heater had been ordered.

7. Despite Defendant's assurances, as of the date of this Complaint—almost a month later—the hot water in the premises remains inoperable. Defendant has repeatedly claimed that the part is backordered and outside of his control to expedite.

8. Plaintiff has suffered significant inconvenience and incurred additional expenses due to Defendant’s failure to provide hot water. Plaintiff has been forced to purchase gym memberships for showering purposes, incurring an extra $30 per month in expenses. Additionally, Plaintiff has incurred increased gas expenses to travel to the gym for showers.

9. Furthermore, Plaintiff has had to take her infant child to another location for bathing, as the lack of hot water in the premises poses a health and safety risk.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Plaintiff alleges a single cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 § 14, which guarantees tenants the right to hot water in their leased premises.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on the claim of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $450, representing additional expenses incurred due to Defendant’s breach;
c. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper; and
d. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorney's fees.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
