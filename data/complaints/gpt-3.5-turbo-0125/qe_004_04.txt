COUNTY OF WORCESTER   
  
Jessica Reynolds,   
Plaintiff   

v.   

Mark Thompson,   
Defendant   

Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]   

COMPLAINT   

I. PARTIES   

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Reynolds, is an individual residing at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605.   

2. The Defendant, Mark Thompson, is the landlord of the aforementioned property located at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605.   

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE   

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14, which governs actions for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in a residential tenancy.   

4. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court as the subject property and the Defendant are located within Worcester County.   

III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS   

5. On September 1, 2021, the Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant for the aforementioned property.   

6. Beginning approximately three months ago, the Plaintiff noticed a recurring issue of mouse infestation in her kitchen at the rented premises. Upon notifying the Defendant, the Defendant's response was limited to setting a few traps and arranging for a single visit from an exterminator.   

7. Despite minimal efforts made by the Defendant, the Plaintiff continues to discover mouse droppings in her kitchen on a regular basis, leading to the disposal of approximately $200 worth of food items and incurring an additional $80 expense on purchasing plastic containers for safe storage of her food items.   

IV. CAUSE OF ACTION   

8. The Defendant's failure to adequately address and remedy the mouse infestation issue in the Plaintiff's kitchen constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as provided under Massachusetts law. The persistent presence of rodents in the rented premises interferes with the Plaintiff's peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the property.   

V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF   

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Find the Defendant in breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;   
b. Award damages to the Plaintiff in the amount of $280;   
c. Order the Defendant to undertake comprehensive pest control measures at the rented premises;   
d. Award any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.   

VI. JURY DEMAND   

The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.   

Respectfully submitted,
