IN THE CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX
MASSACHUSETTS

Jessica Wallis, 
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Thompson, 
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Jessica Wallis, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant, Mark Thompson, states as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Wallis, is an individual residing at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

2. Defendant, Mark Thompson, is the landlord of the subject property located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, Section 19.

4. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court as the subject property is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On May 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the property located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

6. Since October 1, 2025, Defendant has been conducting extensive renovations on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's, resulting in ongoing construction noise during weekdays from approximately 8 AM to 5 PM.

7. The construction noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations among workers, has significantly disrupted Plaintiff's ability to work from home, causing undue stress and interference with professional responsibilities.

8. Plaintiff has also experienced dust infiltration into her unit through the vents due to the ongoing construction activities.

9. While Defendant provided advance notice of the renovation project, the prolonged duration of the disruptions, coupled with the inadequate measures to mitigate the impact on Plaintiff, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

CAUSE OF ACTION

10. Defendant's actions have breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Wallis respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

a. An award of $500 in damages for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Any further relief this Court deems just and proper; and
c. Such other relief as this Court may deem necessary and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
