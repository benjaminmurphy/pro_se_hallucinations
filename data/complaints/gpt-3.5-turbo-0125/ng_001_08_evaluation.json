      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely concerns a plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim against a supermarket for failing to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to take steps to prevent or correct a dangerous condition (a grape on the floor). The court reaffirms that Massachusetts premises liability law requires store owners to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises safe and discusses liability where an owner fails to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable hazards arising from its mode of operation. Although framed in terms of notice and mode of operation, the decision directly reflects the duty to maintain safe premises and to prevent or correct dangerous conditions under Massachusetts negligence law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Historically, Massachusetts has also followed the traditional approach governing premises liability. A store owner has been required to maintain its property \"in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk.\" \u2026 [U]nder the mode of operation approach, \u2026 a store owner will be liable to a plaintiff injured as a result of a dangerous condition \u2026 only if the owner could reasonably foresee that the dangerous condition could occur \u2026 and the owner took inadequate steps to forestall resulting injuries."

Therefore, it does not support the stated negligence proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The judge instructed the jury that if they believed that she was engaged in an attempt to commit suicide and that Morse was injured in endeavoring to prevent her from doing so, then the defendant was guilty of an assault and battery upon him with a dangerous weapon... She was engaged in the accomplishment of an unlawful purpose, and she had gone so far in realizing her object that it was reasonably probable that she would have succeeded if her efforts had not been frustrated by the intervention of Morse."

Without the main opinion text, this snippet alone does not clearly support the specific negligence proposition stated.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

An opinion of value founded on such a use has been held properly admissible where, \u201cupon all the evidence in the case, the jury could warrantably find that a willing buyer\u2019s evaluation of the land could be influenced by the possibility of a change in zoning.\u201d"
