Jessica Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Thompson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of [Your City], Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Michael Thompson, is a resident of [Ex-Spouse City], [Ex-Spouse State].

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On June 15, 2022, this Court entered a custody order granting the parties shared legal custody of their children, Liam Thompson (age 10) and Emma Thompson (age 8). The current custody arrangement provides for the children to primarily reside with Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, on a regular schedule, with Defendant, Michael Thompson, having parenting time every other weekend.

4. Since the entry of the custody order, Plaintiff has observed concerning behavior by Defendant that warrants a modification of the existing custody arrangement. Defendant has unilaterally signed the children up for activities that conflict with Plaintiff's scheduled weekends without prior communication or agreement. As a result, the children have missed important activities while in Plaintiff's care, causing emotional distress. Additionally, Defendant has engaged in a pattern of disparaging remarks about Plaintiff in the presence of the children, including labeling Plaintiff as "selfish" and questioning her love for the children.

5. The disparaging remarks made by Defendant have negatively impacted the children's emotional well-being, with one child developing physical symptoms such as stomach aches on transition days. Such conduct is in direct violation of the current custody order, which mandates support for the children's relationship with each parent and prohibits disparagement of either parent in front of the children.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION

6. Plaintiff respectfully requests a modification of the current custody arrangement to grant primary physical custody to her, with reasonable visitation rights to Defendant. Plaintiff seeks clear and enforceable rules regarding scheduling decisions to prevent unilateral changes that disrupt the children's time with each parent. This modification is necessary to ensure the children's emotional well-being and to promote stability in their lives.

7. Plaintiff seeks such further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
