v.

Michael Smith
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint for Modification against the Defendant, Michael Smith, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is a resident of [City], Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is a resident of [City], Bristol County, Massachusetts. 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to family law and custody matters.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, granting the Probate and Family Court jurisdiction over actions involving the custody of minor children.

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County as the minor children primarily reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 14, 2021, the Court entered a custody order between the parties granting shared legal custody of the minor children, Liam (10 years old) and Ava (8 years old), with the children primarily residing with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and visiting the Defendant, Michael Smith, according to a regular schedule.

7. The current custody arrangement includes provisions to support the children's relationships with each parent and prohibits disparagement of either parent in front of the children.

8. Over the past year, the Defendant has unilaterally signed the children up for activities that conflict with the Plaintiff's scheduled parenting time, causing disruptions and blaming the Plaintiff when the children miss said activities.

9. Furthermore, the Defendant has engaged in a pattern of alienating behavior by making derogatory remarks about the Plaintiff to the children, including calling the Plaintiff "selfish" and suggesting that the Plaintiff does not love the children when requesting changes to the schedule.

10. As a result of the Defendant's actions, one of the children, Ava, has started experiencing physical symptoms such as stomach aches on transition days between parents, indicating emotional distress.

REQUESTED RELIEF

11. The Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the minor children, Liam and Ava, to her, while ensuring the Defendant maintains meaningful involvement and parenting time.

12. Additionally, the Plaintiff seeks a modification to the current custody order to include clear guidelines on scheduling decisions and communication between the parties to prevent unilateral actions that disrupt the children's routine and well-being.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the current custody order to grant primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson.

2. Order the Defendant, Michael Smith, to refrain from disparaging the Plaintiff in the presence of the children and engage in behavior that fosters a positive relationship between the children and both parents.

3. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
