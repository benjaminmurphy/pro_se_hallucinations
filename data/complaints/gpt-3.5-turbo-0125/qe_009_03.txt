IN THE SPRINGFIELD DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF HAMPDEN, MASSACHUSETTS

Jessica Morgan,
Plaintiff

v.

Thomas Reed,
Defendant

Case No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Morgan, by and through the undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas Reed, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Morgan is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA.

2. Defendant Thomas Reed is the landlord of the property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 21, as the issues in dispute arise out of the landlord-tenant relationship within the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Springfield District Court, County of Hampden, Massachusetts, as the subject property is located within this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on May 1, 2022, to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA.

6. Despite numerous complaints, Defendant has failed to address the lack of electricity in one of the bedrooms of the rented apartment for approximately six weeks. The faulty wiring has rendered the outlets and overhead light in that room inoperable.

7. Defendant's chosen electrician communicated that the repairs required to fix the electrical issues are more extensive and complicated, causing additional delays in resolving the matter.

8. Plaintiff has been unable to use the affected bedroom, which she was utilizing as a home office, resulting in significant inconvenience. In order to work remotely, Plaintiff has had to incur additional expenses by working from coffee shops, spending approximately $15 a day on coffee and food. Plaintiff has also resorted to renting a coworking space at a monthly cost of $150 due to the unavailability of her home office.

9. The constant use of the living room to accommodate the displaced office equipment and work supplies has disrupted Plaintiff's living conditions and diminished her quality of life within the rental premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

10. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

11. Defendant's failure to promptly and adequately address the electrical issues in the rented premises and the resulting inability of Plaintiff to use the affected bedroom as a home office constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease agreement under Massachusetts law.

12. This breach has caused Plaintiff harm, inconvenience, and financial losses.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Morgan respectfully prays for relief from this Court as follows:

a. Damages in the amount of $1,200 to compensate for additional expenses incurred and diminished living conditions;
b. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper;
c. Costs and attorney's fees; and
d. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Dated: December 1, 2025
