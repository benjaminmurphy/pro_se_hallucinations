IN THE PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
MIDDLESEX COUNTY

EMILY JOHNSON,
Plaintiff,

v.

MICHAEL SMITH,
Defendant.

DOCKET NO.: [To be assigned by the court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order based on the following factual allegations:

1. The parties to this action are Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") and Michael Smith ("Defendant"). They are the parents of Jacob Smith, an 8-year-old child.

2. On May 14, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting primary physical custody to Plaintiff and providing Defendant with three short visits during the week and Sunday afternoons without overnights, due to his living arrangements at that time.

3. Now, at the age of 8, Jacob Smith desires overnight stays at Defendant's residence. Defendant currently has his own apartment with suitable living arrangements for the child, including a separate bedroom for Jacob.

4. The current custody arrangement, which involves frequent transitions on school nights, is no longer in Jacob's best interests. The constant shuttling back and forth disrupts his school routine, causes difficulty with homework completion, and disrupts bedtime schedules.

5. Both parties, Plaintiff and Defendant, agree that a modification of the existing custody order is necessary to better accommodate Jacob's age, school life, and overall well-being.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:

1. Modify the existing custody order to allow for overnight stays with Defendant at times and in a manner that is in the best interests of Jacob Smith.

2. Grant any other further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
