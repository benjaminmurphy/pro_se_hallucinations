PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT
Middlesex Division

Rachel Bennett, Plaintiff

v.

David Carter, Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

Now comes the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, David Carter, alleges as follows:

1. The parties to this action are Rachel Bennett ("Plaintiff") and David Carter ("Defendant"). Plaintiff is the mother of Sophie Carter, a minor child, aged 9, born on [Date of Birth]. Defendant is the father of the aforementioned minor child.

2. The original custody order governing the custody arrangement for Sophie Carter was entered by this Honorable Court on June 15, 2021.

3. The current custody arrangement entails Plaintiff having primary physical custody of Sophie, while Defendant is entitled to visitation on Wednesdays and every other weekend.

4. Plaintiff and Defendant originally resided in the Cambridge area when the custody order was entered, and the visitation schedule was devised considering their close proximity and Sophie's attendance at a local school.

5. Defendant, David Carter, now seeks to relocate to New Hampshire due to a job opportunity, while maintaining the existing visitation schedule intact. This relocation will necessitate Sophie undertaking approximately ninety-minute drives each way for midweek overnights, causing significant disruptions to her routine, well-being, and academic and extracurricular engagements.

6. Sophie Carter has expressed anxiety regarding the prolonged drives and the resultant impact on her schoolwork and extracurricular activities due to the proposed midweek overnight visits.

7. Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, seeks a modification to the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and to adjust the weekend schedule to mitigate the adverse effects of the long-distance travel on Sophie's well-being and regular activities.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order to remove the midweek overnight visitation and to craft a visitation schedule that is in the best interests of Sophie Carter.

Respectfully submitted,
