IN THE BOSTON HOUSING COURT
COUNTY OF SUFFOLK

Jessica Langford,      
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Silverman,
Defendant

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Langford ("Plaintiff"), and for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Silverman ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Langford is an individual residing at 55 E Wareham St, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. Defendant Mark Silverman is the landlord of the aforementioned property located at 55 E Wareham St, Dorchester, MA 02124.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships. Jurisdiction is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 185C, Section 16, which grants jurisdiction over residential lease disputes.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of a two-bedroom apartment at 55 E Wareham St, Dorchester, MA 02124 on July 1, 2022.

5. Beginning in the winter of 2024, Plaintiff experienced ongoing issues with the heating system in the leased premises. The heat would intermittently drop to inadequate levels, causing discomfort and health issues for Plaintiff.

6. Defendant sent repair technicians on two occasions to address the heating issues. Despite these attempts, the problem persisted, necessitating Plaintiff's purchase of two space heaters to maintain habitable conditions.

7. As a result of the inadequate heating, Plaintiff incurred significant additional expenses for electricity to run the space heaters, totaling approximately $150 per month.

8. In January 2025, Plaintiff was diagnosed with bronchitis, exacerbated by the cold indoor temperatures due to the heating issues. This illness caused Plaintiff to miss three days of work and incur expenses for medical treatment.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9. Plaintiff asserts a claim for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. Defendant's failure to provide adequate and consistent heating has materially interfered with Plaintiff's ability to peacefully and comfortably enjoy the leased premises, in violation of Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Langford respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Declare that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $1200;
c. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts law;
d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff respectfully demands a jury trial on all triable issues.

Respectfully submitted,
