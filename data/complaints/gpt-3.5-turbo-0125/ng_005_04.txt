COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Jordan Smith, by and through undersigned counsel, complains against the Defendant, Michael Johnson, as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an individual residing at [insert address], Springfield, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Michael Johnson is an individual residing at [insert address], Springfield, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action as the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court as the events giving rise to this claim occurred at 123 Elm St, Springfield, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On March 15, 2023, at 123 Elm St, Springfield, MA, Defendant was negligent in maintaining a tall aluminum extension ladder in close proximity to Plaintiff's designated parking area in a shared driveway.

6. Plaintiff had previously expressed concerns to Defendant about the precarious placement of the ladder due to windy conditions but Defendant failed to secure the ladder or relocate it to a safer location.

7. On the aforementioned date, a gust of wind caused the ladder to fall onto Plaintiff's vehicle, resulting in significant damage to the car hood and windshield.

8. As a direct result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff incurred damage to the vehicle, requiring repairs, including bodywork and replacement of the windshield, resulting in financial losses.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
