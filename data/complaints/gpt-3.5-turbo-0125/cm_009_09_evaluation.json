Frondistou-Yannas is an appeal from an original divorce and custody judgment, focusing on initial custody allocation and removal of the children to Greece, not on a later modification proceeding. Although the case discusses that custody and removal decisions must be based on the best interests of the child, it does not address standards or procedure for modifying an existing custody order, so it does not directly support the specific proposition cited.",

Cases involving removal of a child from the jurisdiction present difficult choices\u2026 An evaluation of the best interests of the child requires attention to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change\u2026\u201d"

Bower v. Bournay-Bower does not address standards or procedures for a party\u2019s motion to modify custody, nor does it authorize or discuss the form of relief requested in the proposition. Instead, it addresses the limits of a judge\u2019s inherent authority to appoint a parenting coordinator and the impermissible delegation of judicial decision-making, referencing the statutory modification standard only to contrast it with the unlawful delegation in that case.",

Coleman deals specifically with the standard for *removal* from the Commonwealth under G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 30 in a joint physical custody context, not with a general motion to modify an existing custody arrangement. While the opinion repeatedly applies a best-interests analysis, it does not establish any rule about when or how a court should enter an order modifying custody as requested by a party, so it does not directly support the cited proposition.",

      "relevant_excerpt": "Defendant's next contention is that the State did not prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of aggravated battery with a firearm. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict a defendant, a reviewing court does not reweigh the evidence or determine anew the defendant's guilt. Rather, the reviewing court, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, determines whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."
