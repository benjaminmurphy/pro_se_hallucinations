COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Emily Carter ("Plaintiff"), for her Complaint against Defendant James McAllister ("Defendant"), and alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 456 Green Street, Worcester, MA 01604.

2. Defendant James McAllister is the landlord of the aforementioned property and can be served at [Landlord's Address], Worcester, MA [Landlord's Zip Code].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, which guarantees tenants the right to quiet enjoyment of their rented premises.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the dispute arises within Worcester County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on May 1, 2022, to rent the premises located at 456 Green Street, Worcester, MA 01604.

6. Since approximately three months ago, Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of a severe mouse infestation in the kitchen of the rented premises.

7. Defendant, in response to Plaintiff's complaints, negligently and inadequately addressed the infestation by placing a few traps and engaging an exterminator for a single visit.

8. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the infestation requires more comprehensive treatment, which Defendant has refused to undertake, asserting it to be unnecessary and costly.

9. Plaintiff has continued to find mouse droppings in the kitchen regularly, despite Defendant's minimal actions to remedy the situation.

10. Plaintiff has incurred damages amounting to approximately $280 due to discarded food contaminated by the infestation, as well as expenses for purchasing storage containers in an attempt to mitigate the ongoing issue.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth herein.

12. Defendant's failure to promptly and adequately address the persistent mouse infestation, despite repeated notifications from Plaintiff, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Declare that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14;
b. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $280;
c. Award Plaintiff the costs and expenses of this action; and
d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]
