v.

Samuel Larkin
Defendant

Docket No.:

COMPLAINT

COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Jessica Monroe, by and through undersigned counsel, and complains against the Defendant, Samuel Larkin, as follows:

I. Parties

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Monroe, is an individual residing at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. The Defendant, Samuel Larkin, is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

II. Factual Allegations

3. On January 15, 2023, the Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, for a monthly rent of $1450.

4. During the showing of the apartment, the Defendant assured the Plaintiff that prior water stains on the ceiling were "totally fixed."

5. Subsequently, the Plaintiff discovered that the ceiling leaks persisted during rainstorms, causing water to drip into the apartment in the same spot. Despite multiple complaints, the Defendant dismissed the issue as a "minor cosmetic problem."

6. The continued water intrusion has caused damage to the Plaintiff's property, including soaking her couch and destroying a laptop, resulting in approximately $900 in damages.

7. The Plaintiff has been forced to relocate her belongings within the apartment to avoid the leaking area, leading to a significant reduction in habitable space. Moreover, the presence of mold has caused health concerns, including headaches.

III. Causes of Action

8. The Defendant's failure to adequately address and repair the ongoing water leakage issue constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14 and implicated in numerous case law precedents such as Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 364 Mass. 696 (1974) and Simon v. Provost, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1150 (1989).

IV. Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

9. Declare a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment by the Defendant.

10. Award the Plaintiff damages in the amount of approximately $900 for property damage caused by the Defendant's negligence.

11. Order the Defendant to promptly repair the ceiling leaks and remediate any mold present in the apartment.

12. Award the Plaintiff costs and attorney fees as allowed by law.

V. Jury Demand

The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.

VI. Verification

I, Jessica Monroe, verified this Complaint as true to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
