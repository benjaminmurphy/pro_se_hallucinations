10. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the damages sustained by Plaintiff, including the denting of the hood and cracking of the windshield of her vehicle.

11. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered financial losses including out-of-pocket expenses for repairs, deductible payment, and rental car costs.
