IN THE SPRINGFIELD DISTRICT COURT
COUNTY OF HAMPDEN
MASSACHUSETTS

Jessica Miller
Plaintiff,
v.
Thomas Greene
Defendant.

CASE NO.:

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas Greene alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, is an individual residing at 123 Maple St, Springfield, MA 01105.

2. Defendant, Thomas Greene, is the landlord of the above-mentioned premises.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. On June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple St, Springfield, MA 01105.

4. Since approximately six weeks ago, the second bedroom in the apartment has been without electricity due to faulty wiring. Despite being made aware of this issue, Defendant has failed to rectify the situation promptly.

5. An electrician assessed the wiring issue and concluded that significant repairs are necessary to restore power to the affected bedroom. Defendant informed Plaintiff that obtaining repair quotes has proven challenging due to the dated wiring in the building.

6. As a result of the prolonged lack of electricity in the second bedroom, Plaintiff has been unable to use the room for its intended purpose as a home office. This forced Plaintiff to work from costly alternative locations, incurring daily expenses for food and beverages at coffee shops estimated at $15 per day, in addition to a monthly fee of $150 for a coworking space.

7. The absence of electrical access in the second bedroom has compelled Plaintiff to relocate her office setup to the living room, disrupting the livability and functionality of the apartment as a whole.

CAUSE OF ACTION

8. Plaintiff alleges a single cause of action against Defendant for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 186, § 14 provides tenants with the right to quiet enjoyment of their leased premises, including the right to essential services such as electricity. Defendant's failure to remedy the electrical issues in a timely manner constitutes a breach of this statutory duty owed to Plaintiff.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Monetary damages in the amount of $1,800 for expenses incurred and the diminished value of the leased premises;
2. Any additional costs and fees deemed just and proper by the Court;
3. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem equitable and just.

Respectfully submitted on this 1st day of December, 2025.

[Signature]

Jessica Miller, Plaintiff
123 Maple St
Springfield, MA 01105
