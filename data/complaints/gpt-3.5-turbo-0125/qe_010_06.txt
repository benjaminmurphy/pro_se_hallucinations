COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against Defendant Karen Reynolds, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851.

2. Defendant Karen Reynolds is the landlord of the aforementioned property.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 218, § 21.

4. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court as the property subject to this action is located within its jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851.

6. Plaintiff has been paying monthly rent of $1200 to Defendant as per the terms of the lease.

7. Plaintiff discovered the presence of mold in the bathroom of the property, starting in the shower corner and spreading to the ceiling.

8. Despite Plaintiff's complaints, Defendant failed to remediate the mold and blamed Plaintiff for the issue based on unsubstantiated claims regarding Plaintiff's showering habits.

9. A medical professional has attributed Plaintiff's recent respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, to the mold present in the bathroom.

10. Plaintiff incurred damages amounting to approximately $60 due to having to replace a shower curtain and towels contaminated by the mold.
