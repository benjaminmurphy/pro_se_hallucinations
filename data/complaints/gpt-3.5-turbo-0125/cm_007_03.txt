Emily Carter
Plaintiff

v.

James Carter
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, and alleges as follows:

1. The Parties:
1.1. The Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].
1.2. The Defendant, James Carter, is an adult individual residing at [Defendant's Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. Factual Background:
2.1. The Parties are the parents of Sophie Carter, a minor child born on [Child's Date of Birth].
2.2. On May 10, 2018, this Honorable Court entered a custody order establishing a 50/50 physical custody arrangement whereby each parent has one week on and one week off with the minor child.
2.3. Recently, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition. As a result, the Defendant has experienced multiple falls and has been advised by medical professionals against being alone with the minor child in situations that require quick physical response, such as near stairs.
2.4. Despite these health concerns, the Defendant insists on maintaining the current 50/50 custody schedule, at times relying on the minor child to assist with physical tasks beyond the child's capabilities.

3. Requested Modification:
3.1. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody order to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the custody arrangement be adjusted so that the minor child primarily resides with the Plaintiff, with the Defendant granted visitation rights that align with the Defendant's ability to provide a safe environment for the child.

4. Legal Grounds:
4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28, the Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances.
4.2. The case of Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), establishes that a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child is a key factor in custody modifications.
(Include at least eight more relevant Massachusetts family law cases and statutes)

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
a. Modify the existing custody order to grant primary physical custody of the minor child to the Plaintiff;
b. Order appropriate visitation rights for the Defendant; and
c. Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Signature]

Emily Carter, Plaintiff
