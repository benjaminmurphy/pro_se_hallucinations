IN THE SUPERIOR COURT
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

MICHAEL THOMPSON,
Plaintiff,

v.

JASON REYNOLDS,
Defendant.

Case No.: [To be assigned by the Court]
Date of Incident: May 15, 2023
Date of Complaint: December 1, 2025

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

COMES NOW, Plaintiff Michael Thompson, by and through undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against Defendant Jason Reynolds, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Michael Thompson is an adult individual residing at [Your Address], [City], [State], [Zip Code].

2. Defendant Jason Reynolds is an individual residing at [Defendant's Address].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, Section 3.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County as the incident giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Elm St, Boston, MA 02108.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully biking in a marked bike lane on Elm St in Boston, wearing a helmet, and following all traffic rules.

6. Defendant, a rideshare driver, was parked in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane on Elm St.

7. Without checking his mirror or surroundings, Defendant suddenly swung his car door wide open as Plaintiff was passing, causing Plaintiff to crash into the door and fall to the pavement.

8. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff sustained road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bike frame.

9. Defendant admitted at the scene that he did not see Plaintiff because he was using his phone, but later falsely claimed to his insurance that Plaintiff was "weaving in and out of traffic."

10. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and suffered a loss of approximately $800 in wages.

CAUSES OF ACTION

11. Plaintiff restates and re-alleges the above paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

12. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to operate his vehicle in a reasonable and prudent manner to avoid foreseeable harm.

13. Defendant breached this duty by negligently opening his car door without ensuring the path was clear, causing the collision and subsequent injuries to Plaintiff.

14. Defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

STATUTORY AND CASELAW SUPPORT

15. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 90, Section 14 states that drivers opening vehicle doors must do so "with due regard for the safety of all persons."

16. In Tompkins v. Menino, 297 N.E.2d 177 (Mass. App. Ct. 1973), the court held that a driver has a duty to ensure the way is clear before opening a car door to avoid injuring a passing cyclist.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Michael Thompson respectfully requests the following relief from this Court:

a. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff on his negligence claim against Defendant;
b. Compensatory damages in the amount of $3,300, plus any additional amounts proven at trial;
c. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent allowed by law;
d. Costs and attorneys' fees incurred in prosecuting this action; and
e. Any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
