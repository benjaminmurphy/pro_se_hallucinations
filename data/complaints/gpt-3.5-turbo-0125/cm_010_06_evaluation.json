It does not involve family law, custody, parenting time, or modification of custody orders, nor does it discuss best interests of the child or changed circumstances. Therefore it provides no authority for modifying a custody order to increase parenting time as stated in the proposition.",

As a result, he was sentenced to death for the murder of William Harvey Radcliffe and consecutive terms of twenty years for one count of robbery... Although we find that Count IV of the information, charging money and bank card theft, is merged with Count I, charging robbery, we affirm the remaining convictions and conclude that a sentence of death is proper and appropriate."
