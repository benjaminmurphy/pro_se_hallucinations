COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — Worcester, MA)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff" or “Tenant”) is an individual and a residential tenant residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.

2. Defendant Michael Williams ("Defendant" or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604, and was Plaintiff’s landlord for the premises at all times relevant to this Complaint.

3. Plaintiff began renting the apartment from Defendant on or about May 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Worcester District Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the subject premises are located in Worcester County and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the premises are located in Worcester and the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester.

5. Plaintiff brings this action pro se. Plaintiff’s contact information:
   - Address: 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604
   - Phone: (617) 555-0123
   - Email: psm1433@gmail.com

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. Beginning approximately three months prior to the date of this Complaint (approximately September 2025), Plaintiff began to notice mouse droppings regularly in her kitchen. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent activity and condition.

8. In response, Defendant placed a small number of spring traps in the kitchen. Over the next several weeks only two mice were caught on those traps. Plaintiff continued to find fresh mouse droppings in the kitchen and elsewhere in the unit on approximately a weekly basis.

9. Defendant told Plaintiff that rodent presence was “normal for older buildings” and suggested that Plaintiff keep the kitchen cleaner. Plaintiff maintains that she already keeps the kitchen and unit in a clean and sanitary condition and that the droppings appeared despite her reasonable cleanliness.

10. Defendant retained an exterminator for a single visit. The exterminator informed Defendant and Plaintiff that the building as a whole likely required more comprehensive and repeated treatment in order to eliminate the rodent infestation. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for comprehensive or repeated extermination, stating it would be “overkill” and too expensive.

11. As a direct result of the ongoing rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to take adequate remediation measures, Plaintiff has suffered economic loss and loss of use and enjoyment of her kitchen and dwelling. Plaintiff has had to dispose of approximately $200.00 worth of food (items not sealed or in boxes/bags) that was contaminated or reasonably believed to be contaminated, and has incurred approximately $80.00 in out-of-pocket expenses to purchase rodent-proof plastic food containers. Plaintiff estimates total actual damages in the amount of $280.00.

12. Plaintiff also has experienced anxiety, distress, and interference with her ability to use and enjoy her kitchen and home in a normal way (including cooking and eating in her kitchen), caused by visible signs of rodent activity and Defendant’s failure to abate the infestation.

13. Defendant’s conduct — failing to take reasonable measures to abate the pest infestation and refusing to authorize the comprehensive extermination recommended by the professional exterminator — constitutes an ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s use and quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

14. Plaintiff repeatedly requested that Defendant take the recommended comprehensive measures and repeated treatments necessary to abate the infestation. Defendant refused and thereby failed to remedy a condition that substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s possession and use of the dwelling.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts law)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts common law, a landlord has an obligation to provide tenants with the right to quiet enjoyment and possession of the premises, and to refrain from conduct or omissions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. A persistent infestation that materially interferes with habitability and ordinary use of the premises may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and related landlord obligations. See Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognized implied warranty of habitability in residential leases); see also relevant Massachusetts authority and housing code enforcement statutes and decisions (cited below).

17. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable and customary measures to abate the rodent infestation — including refusing to authorize the comprehensive professional treatments recommended by the exterminator and instead relying on a single visit and a few traps — is an unreasonable omission that has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

18. By failing to remedy the infestation and refusing reasonable, effective abatement, Defendant materially breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease and in law.

19. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered out-of-pocket economic loss in the amount of $280.00 and other damages including loss of use, discomfort, anxiety, and emotional distress. Plaintiff also continues to suffer ongoing interference with the use of her kitchen unless adequate measures are taken.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and provide the following relief:

A. A monetary award for actual damages in the amount of $280.00, plus costs of this action;

B. An order compelling Defendant to take immediate and adequate remedial measures to abate the rodent infestation at the premises, including authorization and payment for comprehensive, building-wide extermination treatment(s) and any reasonable follow-up treatments recommended by a licensed pest control professional, and to repair any points of ingress by which rodents are entering the unit if such repairs are recommended by the pest control professional;

C. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. Such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

I certify that a true copy of this Complaint was mailed/served on the Defendant at his last known address on the same date that this Complaint is filed with the Court.
