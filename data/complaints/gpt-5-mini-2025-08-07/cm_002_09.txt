Michael Johnson
Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Sarah Thompson,  (phone: (617) 555-0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com), residing in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Petitioner is the primary custodial parent of the parties’ minor child.

1.2 Respondent: Michael Johnson, last known to reside in the Greater Cambridge area (or relocating to New Hampshire), is the other parent of the minor child.

1.3 Minor child: Emily Johnson, born 2018 (age 7).

1.4 This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody issues involving Emily pursuant to the existing custody order entered in Middlesex Probate and Family Court on June 15, 2021, and pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B, et seq., and other applicable Massachusetts law.

2. Procedural History
2.1 On June 15, 2021, this Court entered an order awarding primary physical custody of Emily to Petitioner, Sarah Thompson. The order provided that Respondent, Michael Johnson, has parenting time consisting of Wednesday overnights and every other weekend.

2.2 Petitioner now files this Complaint for Modification of Custody seeking modification of the Court’s June 15, 2021 order because of new facts and changed circumstances materially affecting the welfare of Emily.

3. Facts Supporting Modification (Material Change in Circumstances)
3.1 Since entry of the 2021 order, the parties and Emily lived in the Cambridge area, and the current schedule for midweek overnights and alternating weekends was practical and in Emily’s best interests because school and after-school activities were close to home.

3.2 Respondent has informed Petitioner that he intends to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity. Respondent has indicated he intends to continue to exercise parenting time consistent with the June 15, 2021 order (including Wednesday overnight visits every week and alternating weekend visits).

3.3 If the Respondent relocates to New Hampshire and maintains the current midweek overnight schedule, Emily would be required to make long round-trip drives for Respondent’s midweek parenting time—approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in normal traffic—resulting in substantial travel time during school nights.

3.4 The proposed travel would require Emily to miss significant portions of after-school activities, require very early morning departures on school days, and has caused Emily to exhibit anxiety about the long drives and missing activities. Petitioner has observed increased stress and anxiety in Emily related to the prospect of frequent long drives and disrupted school and extracurricular schedules.

3.5 The distance, travel time, and practical impact on Emily’s school attendance, after-school activities, sleep, and emotional well-being constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2021 order.

3.6 Petitioner has attempted to resolve this matter informally with Respondent, proposing reasonable alternative schedules that would reduce travel burden on Emily and preserve meaningful parenting time for Respondent, but the parties have been unable to reach agreement.

4. Legal Basis for Relief
4.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances that affects the child’s best interests. The best interests of the child are paramount in all custody determinations and modifications.

4.2 This Court has the authority to modify custody and parenting-time orders to serve the child’s best interests and to adapt arrangements to changed circumstances, including relocation of a parent and substantial changes to practical viability of existing parenting-time schedules.

4.3 Applicable statutes and authorities include, but are not limited to:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (provisions concerning the care and protection of children and the best interests standard);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and related statutes governing family and domestic relations matters (as applicable to custody determinations);
- Applicable Massachusetts Probate and Family Court practice and case law holding that custody and parenting-time orders should be modified when there is a material change in circumstances and modification is in the child’s best interests.

4.4 Massachusetts case law recognizes that relocation and the practical impacts of distance on a child’s schooling, activities, and emotional well-being can constitute a material change of circumstances warranting modification of custody or parenting-time orders and that the court must evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine the child’s best interests.

(Representative Massachusetts authorities on modification and the best-interests/relocation analysis include decisions and authorities addressing modification standards, parental relocation, and child welfare; see, e.g., cases interpreting the best-interests standard and modification doctrine. Petitioner will rely on and cite applicable SJC and Appeals Court decisions and statutory authority at hearing.)

5. Relief Requested
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order modifying the June 15, 2021 custody order as follows:

5.1 Eliminate Respondent’s midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time. The midweek overnight shall be removed from the parenting-time schedule in light of Respondent’s planned relocation and the unreasonable travel burden it would impose on Emily on school nights.

5.2 Modify Respondent’s alternating weekend parenting time to a schedule that reasonably accommodates the increased distance and travel time, while preserving meaningful parenting time, as follows (proposed schedule — alternatively, the Court may order the parties to follow the Court’s discretion as to schedule):
   - Respondent shall have parenting time every other weekend beginning Saturday at 9:00 a.m. and ending Sunday at 7:00 p.m., or such other alternating-weekend schedule as the Court deems appropriate given the distance and Emily’s school and activities.
   - Exchanges shall occur at a mutually agreed public location in the Cambridge area (or at a location reasonably convenient to Emily’s school) to reduce travel for Emily, unless the Court orders otherwise.
   - During periods when school is not in session (e.g., summer vacation, school breaks), the parties shall arrange a reasonable extended summer parenting-time schedule that takes travel distance into account; if the parties cannot agree, the Court may set a summer schedule.

5.3 Transportation and exchanges:
   - Respondent shall be responsible for travel to and from the agreed exchange location for his parenting time with Emily when he resides at a distance requiring travel out of state (New Hampshire).
   - Exchanges shall be structured to minimize Emily’s travel time and impact on school and extracurricular activities.

5.4 Any further or additional relief the Court deems just and proper to protect Emily’s best interests, including, as necessary, provisions for telephonic or video contact on midweek evenings in lieu of midweek overnights.

6. Certification of Material Change
6.1 Petitioner alleges that the removal of the midweek overnight and the modification of weekend parenting time is necessary because the Respondent’s planned relocation to New Hampshire and insistence on keeping the current midweek schedule will substantially and adversely affect Emily’s schooling, extracurricular participation, sleep, emotional well-being and physical safety while traveling.

6.2 These facts constitute a material change in circumstances since the 2021 order and warrant modification in order to serve Emily’s best interests.

7. Venue and Service
7.1 Venue is proper in the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court because the existing order was entered in this Court and Petitioner and the child reside in Middlesex County.

7.2 Petitioner requests that the Court issue appropriate process and schedule a hearing on this Complaint, and that Respondent be served in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules and the Court’s directions.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Court’s June 15, 2021 custody order;
B. Modify the June 15, 2021 custody order to remove Respondent’s midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time and to adjust the alternating weekend schedule to one that reasonably accommodates travel distance (as outlined above or as the Court orders);
C. Order reasonable transportation and exchange arrangements to minimize impact on Emily’s schooling and extracurricular activities;
D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate in the best interests of the child.

Respectfully submitted,

Date: December 1, 2025

Note on Authorities: Petitioner relies on the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Mass. Gen.
