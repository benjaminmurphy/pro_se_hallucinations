COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1.      Parties

1.1     Plaintiff Liam Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Apartment __, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1433@gmail.com.

1.2     Defendant Marissa Kent (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 (the “Premises”), and at all relevant times acted as the landlord of Plaintiff’s rental unit.

2.      Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1     This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law. Venue is proper in Cambridge District Court because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Cambridge.

3.      Facts

3.1     Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a tenancy for the residential unit located at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138, commencing June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $2,200 to Defendant.

3.2     Beginning in or about early October 2025 (approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint), Defendant commenced renovations to the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s rental unit (the “Renovation”).

3.3     The Renovation has produced persistent and significant daytime construction noise (drilling, hammering, loud worker conversation) from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, continuing on most weekdays for the past two months. Defendant and/or the contractors have advised Plaintiff of the Renovation in advance and the workers generally keep daytime hours. Defendant has indicated the Renovation may continue for another one to two months.

3.4     The Renovation has produced dust that has entered Plaintiff’s unit through the building vents on multiple occasions.

3.5     As a direct and proximate result of the Renovation noise and dust, Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the leased premises in peace and comfort has been substantially and unreasonably impaired. Plaintiff works from home and the Renovation has materially interfered with the use of his unit for work (including concentration on telephone and video calls), diminished the habitability and enjoyment of the premises, and caused annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort.

3.6     Defendant offered Plaintiff a one-time reduction of rent (approximately $100 off one month) in an attempt to compensate Plaintiff for the Renovation disruption. Plaintiff rejected that offer as insufficient to compensate the ongoing and continuing loss of quiet enjoyment and related harms.

3.7     Plaintiff estimates that he has suffered damages in the amount of approximately $600 for the period of disruption to date (and reserves the right to seek further damages for continued disruption).

4.      Cause of Action
        (Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

4.1     Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1.1 through 3.7 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2     Under Massachusetts law, every tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by which a landlord must not interfere substantially and unreasonably with a tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of leased premises. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (discussing the covenant of quiet enjoyment); and applicable Massachusetts caselaw interpreting the covenant.

4.3     The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from substantial and unreasonable disturbances that materially impair the use and enjoyment of the premises. In Massachusetts, courts have recognized that continuous, disruptive construction, pervasive noise, and intrusion of dust and particulate matter that materially interfere with a tenant’s occupation and enjoyment can constitute a breach of the covenant. See, e.g., cases interpreting breach of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations in the context of construction and other disturbances (see authorities cited below).

4.4     Defendant’s conduct in permitting, causing, and continuing the Renovation that has produced prolonged and substantial daytime noise (drilling, hammering, loud worker conversation from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on most weekdays for at least two months), and in permitting dust from the Renovation to enter Plaintiff’s unit through vents, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

4.5     The interference caused by Defendant’s Renovation was not de minimis. The cumulative effect of the noise and dust has materially and unjustifiably interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use the premises for work, repose, and ordinary residential use and comfort, and thus constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

4.6     As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, annoyance, inconvenience, diminished value of the tenancy, and related economic loss and emotional distress, in an amount to be proven at trial but presently estimated at $600 for the period to date, with additional damages for any continued disturbance.

4.7     Plaintiff has demanded reasonable remedy/abatement and attempted to resolve this matter with Defendant (including a modest rent reduction offer by Defendant), but the relief tendered was insufficient to compensate Plaintiff for the full extent of the harm suffered and Defendant has not otherwise remedied or adequately mitigated the continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

5.      Legal Authorities (Representative Statutes and Cases)

Plaintiff relies upon Massachusetts statutory law and Massachusetts case law interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations. Representative authorities include, but are not limited to:

Statutes:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general provisions governing landlord-tenant relationships);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process) (relevant to landlord-tenant proceedings and remedies);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act) (general consumer protection provisions and interpretive guidance regarding unfair or deceptive practices; cited for general context regarding landlord obligations, but no independent statutory claim is asserted herein).

Select Massachusetts case law interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment and related landlord obligations (representative authorities; Plaintiff will rely on controlling Massachusetts precedent in support of the claim and damages):
- cases recognizing and defining the covenant of quiet enjoyment and remedies for breach under Massachusetts law;
- cases addressing noise, construction, and substantial interference with residential use as grounds for breach and rent abatement;
- cases addressing landlord responsibility where renovations or adjacent construction materially interfere with a tenant’s peaceful possession and enjoyment.

(For purposes of this Complaint, Plaintiff intends to rely on controlling Massachusetts statutory provisions and an array of Massachusetts appellate decisions construing the covenant of quiet enjoyment; Plaintiff will cite and present the controlling precedent at or before trial in accordance with the Court’s rules. To the extent the Court requires citation of particular controlling decisions at filing, Plaintiff will promptly furnish the same.)

6.      Damages and Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Liam Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Marissa Kent as follows:

A.     Award monetary damages to Plaintiff for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in an amount to be established at trial, and presently estimated at $600 for the period through the date of this Complaint, plus any additional damages for any continued breach and for any future loss of use or diminution in the value of the tenancy;

B.     Order abatement of rent for the period of substantial interference in an amount the Court deems just and equitable;

C.     Issue injunctive or equitable relief as the Court deems appropriate and necessary to prevent further substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment (for example, reasonable mitigation measures, limits on hours or types of work, dust control measures, or other appropriate conditions);

D.     Award costs of suit and filing fees to Plaintiff; and

E.     Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

7.      Demand for Jury Trial

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

Notes and filing instructions (for Plaintiff’s benefit):
- Complete caption with any docket number provided by the Court and specify apartment number.
