COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE
(Jury Trial Demanded)

1.     Plaintiff Jessica Harper (“Plaintiff” or “Harper”) brings this action against Quincy Dine‑In (“Defendant” or “Quincy Dine‑In”) to recover damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to keep its premises safe for invitees.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2.     Plaintiff Jessica Harper is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555‑0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

3.     Defendant Quincy Dine‑In is a business entity that operates a restaurant at 245 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169. At all times relevant hereto, Quincy Dine‑In owned, controlled, maintained, managed and/or operated the restaurant premises located at that address.

4.     The incident that is the subject of this Complaint occurred on July 15, 2023 at Quincy Dine‑In’s premises located at 245 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.

5.     Venue is proper in the Superior Court, County of Barnstable, because Plaintiff intends to file this action in the Barnstable Superior Court (as Plaintiff chooses), and because Quincy Dine‑In does business in the Commonwealth. (Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, 8, 10; see also M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions).)

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6.     On July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a business invitee on the premises of Quincy Dine‑In for the purpose of dining at the restaurant.

7.     At approximately the time Plaintiff was dining, a restaurant server was carrying a tray with several water glasses in a narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room. The server dropped the tray, causing glass to break and water and ice to spill onto the tile floor of the hallway.

8.     The server removed the broken glass quickly, but she left the water and ice on the tile floor and stated to others that she would “be right back with a mop.” No employee placed any wet floor sign, cone, barrier, or other warning device to notify invitees of the hazardous condition.

9.     Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff got up to use the restroom and walked into the narrow hallway. The hallway floor remained wet and slippery; the water was visibly glistening on the tile surface.

10.    Believing for a moment that the shine was part of the tile finish, and without notice or warning from any restaurant employee, Plaintiff stepped onto the wet area, slipped and twisted her knee severely.

11.    Following the fall, Plaintiff immediately sought medical attention at urgent care. She was diagnosed with a sprained knee and was prescribed supportive measures, including a knee brace, and referred for physical therapy.

12.    Plaintiff’s knee injury required weeks of treatment, including the use of a brace, multiple physical therapy sessions, and follow up to monitor recovery.

13.    Plaintiff’s reasonable and foreseeable damages as a result of the incident include medical expenses of approximately $2,500 and lost wages of approximately $1,200. Plaintiff also sustained pain, suffering, disability, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, and other damages in amounts to be determined at trial.

14.    After Plaintiff’s fall, she overheard restaurant staff discussing the condition of the hallway and that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, which indicates that restaurant employees knew or reasonably should have known of the hazardous condition and failed to take reasonable steps to remove it or warn invitees.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16.    As the owner/operator of a restaurant open to the public, Defendant owed a duty to its invitees, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition, to inspect for dangerous conditions, and to warn of or make safe any dangerous conditions which the Defendant knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known about. This duty includes a duty to warn invitees of latent or transient hazards and an obligation to use reasonable care to remove or safeguard against hazards created by its employees. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A; Mass. common law principles of premises liability.

17.    Defendant, by and through its agents, employees and servants, breached that duty in the following respects, among others:
       a.     Failing to exercise reasonable care to inspect and discover the hazard (water and ice) in the hallway after a tray of glasses was dropped;
       b.     Failing to warn invitees, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous wet condition by failing to place warning cones, signs, barriers, or to otherwise alert patrons of the hazard;
       c.     Failing to remove or reasonably abate the hazard within a reasonable time after it was created and after Defendant’s employees knew or reasonably should have known of it;
       d.     Failing to promulgate, enforce, and follow reasonable procedures to ensure prompt clean‑up and warning of spills and hazards in a narrow, high‑traffic walkway between the kitchen and the dining room;
       e.     Failing to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances.

18.    Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages because the foreseeable consequence of leaving a wet slippery condition in a high‑traffic walkway without warning is that invitees will slip, fall, and suffer injury.

19.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury (a sprained knee), pain and suffering, incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500, lost wages of approximately $1,200, and has endured and will continue to endure physical pain, mental anguish, disability, loss of enjoyment of life, and other compensable damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Quincy Dine‑In as follows:

A.     Awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, lost wages, and damages for pain and suffering;
B.     Awarding interest, costs, and disbursements pursuant to applicable law;
C.     Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITIES (non‑exhaustive)

Plaintiff asserts her negligence claim under Massachusetts common law and relies upon general principles of premises liability and negligence including, but not limited to, the following authorities and doctrines:

- Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Mass. R. Civ. P. 8, 10, 11, 38 (pleadings, signatures, and jury trial);
- M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 324A, 343, 343A (duty of possessor of land to invitees, failure to warn and to make safe hazardous conditions, liability for physical harm caused by affirmative acts and negligent omissions);
- Massachusetts cases and principles recognizing and applying premises liability and negligence standards to business invitees and property possessors, including the duty to inspect for and remedy or warn of hazardous conditions and to supervise employees whose actions create or exacerbate hazardous conditions (see, e.g., Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court decisions applying Restatement principles in slip and fall cases and business premises cases);
- Such other cases, statutes, rules, treatises, and authorities as may be cited in Plaintiff’s trial memoranda, motion practice, or at trial.

(Notes on authorities: Plaintiff identifies the Restatement sections and Massachusetts procedural rules and statutes above as governing law and reserves the right to cite all controlling Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions applying these principles in briefing and at trial.)

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff asks for judgment against Defendant as set forth above.
