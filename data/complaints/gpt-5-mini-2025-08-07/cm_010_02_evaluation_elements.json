      "reasoning": "The complaint ties the alleged changes to the child\u2019s welfare, asserting that increased time with Plaintiff will promote Sophie\u2019s stability and emotional well\u2011being and citing improved parental capacity, a suitable home, the child\u2019s expressed preference, and harmful parental conflict as factors favoring modification under Massachusetts best\u2011interest standards."
