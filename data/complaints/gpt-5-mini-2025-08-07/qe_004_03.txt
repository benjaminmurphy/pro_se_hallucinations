COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Only Cause of Action: Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

1.     Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1    Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”) is an individual resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents residential premises located at 456 Green Street, Apartment __, Worcester, MA 01604.
1.2    Defendant James McAllister (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 456 Green Street, Worcester, Massachusetts and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3    Plaintiff entered into a tenancy with Defendant commencing on or about May 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00.
1.4    The Worcester District Court has jurisdiction of this action under Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in this Court because the premises at issue are located in Worcester and because Defendant resides and conducts business in Worcester County.

2.     Facts
2.1    Plaintiff has been a tenant at 456 Green Street since May 1, 2022 and has paid rent regularly and performed all obligations required of her under the tenancy.
2.2    Beginning approximately three months before the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff first observed mouse droppings in her kitchen and notified Defendant of the presence of mice in the dwelling.
2.3    In response, Defendant placed a small number of snap traps in the kitchen and reported to Plaintiff that such limited measures were sufficient. Defendant told Plaintiff that mouse activity was “normal for older buildings” and suggested that Plaintiff needed to keep her kitchen cleaner.
2.4    Shortly after Defendant placed traps, a pest control technician visited the building on a single occasion at Defendant’s direction. The technician informed Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive and repeated pest treatment (beyond a single visit and a few traps) to eradicate the infestation.
2.5    Despite the technician’s recommendation, Defendant refused to authorize or pay for comprehensive pest control treatment, stating it would be “overkill” and too expensive.
2.6    Since Defendant’s limited remediation efforts, mice have continued to be present in Plaintiff’s kitchen; Plaintiff continues to find mouse droppings on a weekly basis.
2.7    As a result of the ongoing infestation, Plaintiff has suffered economic losses and non-economic harms, including (a) the loss of food she was forced to discard (approximately $200.00) because packaging was contaminated or could not be relied on; (b) the purchase of sealed plastic food containers to protect food from contamination (approximately $80.00); (c) ongoing anxiety, distress, and diminished use and enjoyment of her kitchen and apartment; and (d) inconvenience and repeated disturbance caused by continued presence of rodents and the need to monitor and clean affected areas.
2.8    Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant take effective remedial action to abate the infestation and restore the premises to a reasonable state of habitability and peaceful enjoyment. Defendant has failed and refused to take such reasonable and effective measures.

3.     Legal Basis — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
3.1    Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under which the landlord must refrain from materially interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, and must not permit conditions that substantially deprive the tenant of beneficial use of the premises. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing landlord duty to maintain premises fit for habitation and protecting tenant’s quiet enjoyment); see also cases and authorities addressing the landlord’s duty to abate conditions that interfere with habitability and enjoyment.
3.2    Massachusetts statutory and regulatory law recognizes and enforces minimum standards of habitability and public health through the State Sanitary Code and the public health statutes enforced by local boards of health. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (authorizing boards of health to enforce sanitary regulations); State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), including provisions addressing pest infestation and tenant habitability standards. Landlords are required to keep residential premises in a fit and habitable condition and to remedy conditions that create health or safety hazards.
3.3    Massachusetts courts have long treated the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the implied warranty of habitability as enforceable tenant protections against landlord conduct or omissions that substantially and materially impair a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., Javins, supra; Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (discussing warranty of habitability doctrine); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (pest infestation and habitability); see also other authorities recognizing landlord obligations to abate conditions that interfere with tenant use and enjoyment.
3.4    Where a landlord fails to take reasonable and timely action to abate infestations or conditions that unreasonably interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, the landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the tenant is entitled to damages and injunctive relief. See Javins, supra; Green v. Superior Court, supra; Hilder v. St. Peter, supra; see also, e.g., cases recognizing tenants’ remedies for persistent pest infestations and landlord inaction (collecting authorities).

4.     Application of Law to Facts
4.1    Plaintiff paid rent and fulfilled her obligations under the tenancy. Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to maintain the premises in a habitable condition and to take reasonable measures to abate conditions (including pest infestation) that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.
4.2    Defendant’s conduct — limited trap placement, a single exterminator visit contrary to the technician’s recommendation for more comprehensive treatment, and refusal to authorize additional, reasonable pest control measures — constitutes a material and substantial failure to abate a condition that interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and use of her kitchen and apartment.
4.3    Defendant’s proffered justification (that mouse droppings are “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff should simply clean more) does not excuse Defendant’s obligation to remedy a continuing infestation that materially impairs habitability and use. Defendant’s failure to remedy the infestation has caused Plaintiff economic losses, emotional distress, and a loss of the full use and enjoyment of her leased premises.

5.     Damages
5.1    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages, including:
       a. food loss and replacement costs (approximately $200.00);
       b. expenses for sealed food storage containers (approximately $80.00);
       c. general damages for loss of use, inconvenience, distress, and anxiety resulting from persistent infestation and inability to use her kitchen without concern for contamination;
       d. any other direct and consequential damages proven at trial.
5.2    Plaintiff presently estimates compensatory damages specific to economic losses at $280.00 (food and container expenses) and seeks additional general damages for non-economic harms in an amount to be determined at trial.

6.     Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, and award the following relief:
6.1    Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including the $280.00 in out-of-pocket economic losses and additional general damages for loss of use, distress and inconvenience caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
6.2    Enter an order directing Defendant to take all reasonable and necessary measures to abate the rodent infestation at 456 Green Street, Worcester, MA, including but not limited to prompt, comprehensive pest-control treatment of the apartment and building and any follow-up treatments recommended by a licensed pest-control professional (injunctive relief);
6.3    Award Plaintiff costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees if permitted by law;
6.4    Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

7.     Legal Authorities (Representative statutes, regulations, and cases relied on)
Plaintiff expressly invokes and relies upon the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as enforced in landlord-tenant jurisprudence and the following representative authorities:
Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statute provisions generally; landlord and tenant relationship and summary process provisions), including but not limited to provisions regarding landlord duties and tenant remedies.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health), including authority for boards of health to enforce sanitary conditions and housing-related public health standards.
- State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), including provisions addressing pest infestation and obligations to maintain sanitary, habitable housing.
- Any applicable Worcester housing and sanitary codes and regulations enforced by the Worcester Board of Health.

Representative Case Law and Authorities
(Selected authorities recognizing landlord responsibilities for habitability, abatement of nuisances and pests, and enforcement of quiet enjoyment and implied warranty doctrines)
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970).
- Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974).
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984).
- Other Massachusetts and out-of-state authorities recognizing that landlord failure to remedy material interferences with habitability and enjoyment may constitute breach of quiet enjoyment and entitle tenants to damages and injunctive relief. Plaintiff will rely at trial on Massachusetts case law addressing these principles and their application to pest infestations and landlord inaction, and will cite additional Massachusetts appellate and trial decisions addressing the landlord’s duty to provide premises fit for habitation and free from conditions that materially interfere with tenant use and enjoyment.

(Notes regarding the foregoing: Plaintiff provides these authorities as representative and reserves the right to cite additional specific Massachusetts statutory and case authorities and local housing code provisions at or prior to trial. Plaintiff expressly relies on Massachusetts statutory and regulatory habitability standards (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.) and the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as applied under Massachusetts law.)

8.     Demand for Jury Trial
Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.
