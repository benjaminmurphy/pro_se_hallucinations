In Palsgraf, the majority explicitly holds that, as to Mrs. Palsgraf, the railroad\u2019s conduct was not negligent at all and thus there was no actionable wrong or proximate cause linking the guards\u2019 acts to her injuries. The opinion is frequently cited for limiting liability based on duty and foreseeability, not for finding proximate cause for a plaintiff\u2019s physical injuries and related damages.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe conduct of the defendant\u2019s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all\u2026 The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability\u2026 If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort.\u201d"

It does not discuss negligence, duty, breach, causation, damages, or any tort principles. Therefore it does not provide authority for the proposition about the well-established elements of negligence in Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The single justice neither erred nor abused his discretion in denying relief. To the extent the petition can be viewed as seeking relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, the errors claimed in the petition either were or could have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, or in a motion for postconviction relief under Mass. R. Crim.

It does not involve animals, owner liability, negligence, or foreseeability of harm, and therefore cannot provide authority for the stated proposition about negligent handling or control of animals.
