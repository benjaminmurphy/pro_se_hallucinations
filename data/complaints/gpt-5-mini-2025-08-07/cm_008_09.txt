JESSICA THOMPSON
Plaintiff/Petitioner

v.

MICHAEL DAVIS
Defendant/Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Jessica Thompson, residing at an address within the jurisdiction of this Court (contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com).
1.2 Respondent: Michael Davis, residing within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
1.3 Minor Child: Emily Davis, age 9.
1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and rules, including the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (M.G.L. c. 209C), and pursuant to this Court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody matters arising from the judgment entered in this Court on June 15, 2021.

2. Relief Requested
Petitioner seeks modification of the existing custody order entered June 15, 2021, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child. Petitioner requests, in the alternative and/or in combination as appropriate:
a. An order awarding Petitioner final decision-making authority on issues of school attendance and educational matters for Emily Davis (or, in the alternative, an order granting Petitioner final decision-making authority over school attendance and educational issues and clarifying responsibilities with respect to tutoring and academic supports);
b. Alternatively or additionally, a modification of the parenting time schedule to limit or eliminate Respondent’s Sunday-night overnights and/or other school-night parenting time that interferes with Emily’s regular school attendance and required tutoring;
c. Temporary emergency relief as the Court deems appropriate (including a temporary order changing Emily’s Sunday-night parenting time pending hearing) to prevent further educational harm;
d. An order requiring the parties to cooperate in obtaining appropriate educational evaluations and tutoring, and to follow through with medically or educationally recommended supports;
e. An order for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including costs and any necessary further evaluation or supervision (e.g., parenting coordinator or custody evaluator).

3. Procedural History
3.1 The parties are subject to a custody judgment entered by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, Woburn Division, on June 15, 2021, which provides that the parties share joint legal custody of Emily Davis, with Petitioner Jessica Thompson designated as the primary residential parent. The order provides that the parties shall cooperate on school matters and keep one another informed regarding the child’s education.
3.2 The current parenting schedule grants Respondent substantial weekend time, including overnights that extend through Sunday nights.

4. Factual Allegations Showing Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 When the original order was entered on June 15, 2021, Emily Davis was performing satisfactorily in school. The parties were cooperating on educational matters at that time.
4.2 Over the past year (beginning in or about late 2024 and continuing through 2025), Respondent has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays immediately following Respondent’s weekend parenting time. Respondent describes these absences as “mental health days.”
4.3 There has been no consistent medical documentation or physician’s note provided to Petitioner or the school to justify these Monday absences. Respondent has not provided medical or mental-health professional documentation to Petitioner or the school that would justify repeated unexcused absences.
4.4 The school has issued truancy warnings to Petitioner (and the parties’ home contact) as a result of the repeated Monday absences. Petitioner has worked to address attendance with the school, and has attempted to notify Respondent and to obtain his cooperation in getting Emily to school, but Respondent has continued and/or failed to correct the pattern.
4.5 In addition, Respondent has regularly refused or failed to transport Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions and other school-based academic supports when such services occur during Respondent’s parenting time on weekends, thereby interfering with critical academic remediation.
4.6 As a result of the increased absences and missed tutoring, Emily’s grades and test scores have declined over the past year, and there is credible concern that the child’s educational progress and stability are being harmed by the pattern described above.
4.7 Petitioner has made reasonable attempts to address the situation with Respondent and to secure appropriate supports for Emily (including contacting the school and proposing cooperative solutions), but Respondent’s conduct has not changed, and the situation has continued to worsen.
4.8 The foregoing facts constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2021 custody order and adversely affect Emily’s health, safety, education, and welfare.

5. Legal Basis for Modification
5.1 Petitioner alleges that modification of custody and/or decision-making authority is warranted under the best-interests-of-the-child standard and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction to modify custody where there has been a material change in circumstances which affects the child’s welfare.
5.2 Petitioner invokes the Commonwealth’s statutes and authorities governing custody and child welfare, including in particular:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act) (jurisdictional authority);
- The Court’s continuing authority to modify custody orders as provided under Massachusetts family law and Probate and Family Court practice.
5.3 Petitioner further relies on the general legal principles that a parent’s unilateral actions that interfere with a child’s required school attendance and essential educational supports, and which cause demonstrable decline in the child’s academic functioning, constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification to protect the child’s best interests. (Petitioner intends to rely on applicable Massachusetts appellate authority and statutes regarding custody modification, best interests of the child, and the Court’s authority to order educational decision-making and to enforce school attendance.)

6. Request for Temporary and Expedited Relief
6.1 Given the continuing nature of the problem and the ongoing adverse effect on Emily’s education, Petitioner requests an expedited hearing on this Complaint and that the Court enter an appropriate temporary order pending final hearing, including but not limited to:
a. A temporary order granting Petitioner exclusive decision-making authority over Emily’s school attendance and educational programs; and/or
b. A temporary modification restricting Respondent’s overnight parenting time on Sunday nights or other school-night overnights that lead to missed school days; and/or
c. An order that Respondent produce any medical or mental-health documentation supporting the Monday absences and that any future absences claimed for mental-health reasons be supported by contemporaneous documentation from a treating professional; and/or
d. An order directing the parties to cooperate in obtaining school records, attendance records, and any educational evaluations the Court deems appropriate.

7. Supporting Evidence and Relief Sought
7.1 Petitioner will submit or make available at hearing the relevant school attendance records, truancy notices, grade and test-score reports showing decline, communications with the school and Respondent about attendance and tutoring, and any other relevant documentary evidence.
7.2 Petitioner requests that the Court enter any order necessary to protect Emily’s educational interests, including but not limited to:
a. Granting Petitioner final decision-making authority over school attendance and educational issues; and/or
b. Modifying Respondent’s parenting time to avoid Sunday-night overnights and/or to prevent further school absences; and/or
c. Requiring that any claimed medical or mental-health leave from school be supported by contemporaneous medical/mental-health documentation; and/or
d. Ordering compliance with tutoring plans and educational supports and, if necessary, supervised exchanges or a parenting coordinator to ensure compliance; and/or
e. Such other equitable relief as the Court deems necessary and proper.

8. Reservation of Rights
8.1 Petitioner reserves the right to seek additional relief, including child-focused evaluations, supervised parenting time if indicated, counsel fees, and other relief permissible under Massachusetts law.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
a. Assume continuing jurisdiction over this matter;
b. Enter an order modifying the custody arrangement as set forth above based on a material change in circumstances and in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Davis;
c. Grant temporary and/or emergency relief pending final hearing as described above;
d. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,

Jessica Thompson
