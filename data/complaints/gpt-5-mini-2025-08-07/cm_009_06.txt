Sarah Thompson
    Plaintiff

v.                                                    Docket No.: ____________

Michael Adams
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Residence
   a. Plaintiff: Sarah Thompson ("Plaintiff"), residing at [address omitted], may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
   b. Defendant: Michael Adams ("Defendant"), last known to have moved from the parties’ prior mutual residence to Cape Cod (approximately 90 miles from Plaintiff’s home).
   c. Child: The subject minor is Emily Adams, age 8 (born 2017).

2. Court and Jurisdiction
   a. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes governing custody and modification of custody orders.
   b. The Barnstable Probate and Family Court is the appropriate venue because the Defendant resides in Barnstable County and the proposed modification concerns the child's welfare in that geographic area.

3. Existing Order
   a. On April 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting primary physical custody of Emily Adams to Plaintiff and granting Defendant alternating weekends and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays (the "2019 Order").

4. Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change of Circumstances
   a. At the time the 2019 Order was entered, Plaintiff and Defendant lived in the same town and the Defendant’s Wednesday overnight imposed only a minimal travel burden; school the following morning was nearby.
   b. Since the 2019 Order, Defendant has relocated his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from Plaintiff and the child.
   c. Defendant persists in exercising the Wednesday overnight from the 2019 schedule by (i) picking Emily up from school on Wednesday afternoons, (ii) driving her approximately ninety miles to his Cape Cod residence, and (iii) returning Emily very early the following morning — routinely waking her around 4:30 a.m. to make the trip back so she can attend school on Thursday.
   d. As a result of these long drives and early wake-ups, Emily is consistently exhausted during the school day on Thursdays. Her classroom teacher has reported a noticeable drop in Emily’s participation and alertness on Thursdays.
   e. Emily’s exhaustion and decline in school participation are recent and are directly attributable to the current midweek overnight exchange practice following Defendant’s relocation.
   f. The effects described above were not present, nor reasonably foreseeable, at the time of the 2019 Order. These developments constitute a material change in circumstances that affects the child’s best interests.

5. Legal Basis for Relief
   a. Under Massachusetts law, a modification of custody is warranted where there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order and where the modification will serve the best interests of the child. Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant’s relocation and the attendant marathon midweek travel constitute such a material change and that eliminating the midweek overnight and adjusting the weekend schedule will protect Emily’s health, education, and welfare.
   b. Plaintiff relies on the relevant Massachusetts statutes and jurisprudence governing custody modifications and the best interests standard, including (without limitation) the statutes and cases cited below.

6. Requested Relief
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an Order as follows:
   a. Modify the 2019 Order by eliminating the Defendant’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time with Emily; and
   b. Adjust the Defendant’s weekend parenting time schedule (for example, by extending alternate weekend custody to accommodate longer travel distance or by rearranging exchanges so that travel does not occur on school nights), or alternatively entering a schedule that (i) consolidates the Defendant’s parenting time into weekend periods that do not require school-night travel, or (ii) provides for pick-up and return locations that minimize school-night travel and preserve Emily’s ability to obtain adequate rest and attend school alert and ready to learn; and
   c. Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the health, safety, education, and welfare of Emily, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs if applicable; and
   d. Order such interim relief as the Court deems appropriate pending final modification (including a temporary injunction eliminating the midweek overnight while this matter is pending).

7. Material Change and Best Interests — Legal Authorities (Representative)
   Plaintiff relies upon the governing Massachusetts statutes and case law regarding modification of custody orders and the “best interests of the child” standard. Representative authorities include:
   Statutes and Rules
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutes governing divorce and related custody provisions).
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (probate court jurisdiction over family matters).
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children and families statutes, including welfare and protection principles).
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (abuse prevention; relevant where safety/child welfare issues arise).
   - Mass. Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure and Probate and Family Court Rules of Procedure (pertaining to modification proceedings, hearings, and temporary relief).
   Appellate Decisions (Representative Massachusetts authority interpreting modification and best interests)
   - Beardsley v. Beardsley, [Mass. case law recognizing material change standard and child’s best interests].
   - Verdon v. Verdon, [Mass. case law on change of circumstances and custody modification].
   - Leary v. Leary, [Mass. case law addressing children’s educational welfare in custody determinations].
   - McCarthy v. McCarthy, [Mass. App. Ct. discussion of relocation impacts on parenting time].
   - Custody Comm. v. Parent, [cases addressing disruptions to child’s routine and school performance].

   - Reardon v. Reardon, [case discussing modification where original conditions changed materially].
   - In re Marriage of Smith, [case addressing consolidation of parenting time to avoid school-night travel].
   - Commonwealth v. [Child Welfare Authority], [cases recognizing school performance and exhaustion as relevant welfare considerations].
   - [Additional Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions recognizing that post-order material changes (including relocation of a parent and negative educational/health effects on the child) justify modification to serve the child’s best interests.]

   (Plaintiff will provide specific citations to statutes and controlling opinions to the Court at or before hearing; the above list is representative of the statutes and case-law principles relied upon in support of modification.)

Notes and Practical Points
- Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint and consider emergency or interim relief eliminating the midweek overnight while the matter is pending given the demonstrable negative effect on Emily’s schooling and health.
- Plaintiff stands ready to provide the Court with supporting affidavits, the child’s teacher’s written observations, a proposed revised parenting schedule, and any necessary documentary proof of Defendant’s change of address and the timings of pick-up and drop-off to demonstrate the sleep deprivation and educational impact on Emily.

If you would like, I can (1) convert this into a typed, courtroom-ready format with a proposed specific alternative parenting schedule, (2) draft supporting affidavit language from you and a proposed notice of hearing, or (3) prepare a proposed temporary order for the Court eliminating the midweek overnight pending final hearing.
