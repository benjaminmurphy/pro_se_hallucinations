Civil Action No. ____________

Maya Johnson,
    Plaintiff

v.

Lisa Thompson,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maya Johnson ("Plaintiff" or "Johnson") is a resident of Roxbury, Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents a basement apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts (the "Premises").

2. Defendant Lisa Thompson ("Defendant" or "Landlord") is the owner and landlord of the Premises and may be served at the Premises or at any address of record.

3. Plaintiff entered into tenancy of the Premises beginning on March 1, 2022. Plaintiff currently pays rent of $1,200 per month.

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts statutes governing summary process, landlord-tenant disputes, and the general jurisdiction of the Housing Court over housing matters. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Roxbury, which is in Suffolk County and within this Court's territorial jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs.

6. Beginning in or about November 2025, and continuing to the present, Plaintiff discovered recurrent water seepage into the basement unit through an exterior basement wall during heavy rain events. The water intrusion is caused by a defect in the structure/grade/drainage adjacent to the basement wall that allows rainwater to enter the unit.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem by text message in November 2025. Defendant responded that she would "look into it." In the following weeks no effective repairs or permanent remediation were performed by Defendant.

8. After repeated attempts to obtain a repair, on or about mid-November 2025 Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston to request an inspection. The City conducted an inspection and identified the water infiltration and additional code violations related to the condition of the Premises. The City informed Plaintiff of those findings.

9. The water intrusion ruined a rug and damaged a bookshelf that had been placed against the affected wall. Plaintiff reasonably estimates the cost to replace these items at approximately $400 in total.

10. Because of the ongoing dampness and indoor humidity caused by the water intrusion, Plaintiff has been forced to run a dehumidifier constantly to maintain habitable conditions. The dehumidifier has increased Plaintiff’s electricity usage and utility cost.

11. Defendant has not made any permanent repairs or remedial measures to stop the water intrusion and has not otherwise corrected the hazardous or unfit condition identified by the municipal inspection.

12. In late November 2025, after the municipal inspection, Defendant told Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 and characterized Plaintiff as a "problem tenant." Defendant stated that the reason she would not renew was Plaintiff’s being late on rent for approximately two weeks in October 2025 (which Plaintiff fully paid together with the late fee). The timing of Defendant’s refusal to renew immediately following the municipal inspection and code violation findings is suspicious and suggests a retaliatory motivation. (Plaintiff does not bring a separate claim for retaliatory eviction here; this fact is pleaded to show Defendant’s motive and the context of the breach of quiet enjoyment alleged below.)

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair the water infiltration and the attendant conditions, Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage, including: (a) damage to personal property (approx. $400); (b) increased electric expense related to the need to run a dehumidifier; (c) loss of the full benefit of the leasehold and quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises; and (d) distress, inconvenience, and attorneys’ fees and costs as permitted by law. Plaintiff seeks recovery of damages for these losses.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law / Massachusetts)

14. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13.

15. Under Massachusetts law, every lease for a term of years includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, by which the landlord covenant not to interfere, directly or indirectly, with the tenant’s possession or enjoyment of the leased premises. A breach of that covenant occurs where a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with a tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises, or where the landlord permits a condition to persist that deprives the tenant of the beneficial use of the premises.

16. Defendant, as landlord and owner of the Premises, had a duty to maintain the Premises in a condition fit for occupancy and to take reasonable measures to repair conditions that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the Premises. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to repair known water infiltration that materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, by permitting the hazardous and unsanitary condition to persist after notice, and by taking actions and making statements (including refusal to renew the lease immediately after the municipal inspection) that further interfered with Plaintiff’s rights under the lease.

17. Defendant’s breach was knowing and/or inexcusable after receiving notice of the defect, or at least was negligent and constitutes a failure to perform the obligations implied in a residential lease and required by applicable housing and sanitary codes.

18. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s breach in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to: (a) replacement value of damaged personal property (approximately $400); (b) increased electricity and utility costs; (c) diminution of the value of Plaintiff’s leasehold; (d) consequential damages for the loss of use, inconvenience, and distress; and (e) costs and interest.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

19. Plaintiff relies on the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized in Massachusetts landlord-tenant jurisprudence and seeks damages and equitable relief consistent with precedent and statutory/regulatory obligations imposed on landlords in Massachusetts.

20. Relevant statutes, regulations, and authorities include, without limitation:
   - Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186 (G.L. c. 186) — landlord and tenant provisions.
   - Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 239 (G.L. c. 239) — summary process (eviction) procedures and related landlord-tenant provisions.
   - Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 111 (G.L. c. 111) — public health statutes enabling enforcement of housing codes by local boards of health.
   - Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
   - Authorities recognizing and explaining the covenant of quiet enjoyment, habitability obligations, and remedies in landlord-tenant law (see, e.g., leading Massachusetts cases and decisions interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties, and analogous authorities construing obligations to repair and remediate housing code violations).
   - Where relevant: decisions and rules of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), Appeals Court, and Housing Court addressing landlord obligations, remedies for breaches of quiet enjoyment, and the relationship between housing code violations and tenant remedies in lease contexts.

(For ease of the Court and counsel, Plaintiff will rely at trial on statutory and regulatory provisions identified above (including 105 CMR 410.000), the governing Massachusetts landlord-tenant statutory framework (G.L. c. 186; G.L. c. 239), and Massachusetts caselaw recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and tenant remedies for interference with possession. At the time of trial Plaintiff will identify controlling SJC and Appeals Court decisions on point and will rely on those authorities to support the elements of the claim of breach of quiet enjoyment and the relief requested.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant and grant the following relief:

A. A finding that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts law by failing to repair and abate ongoing water infiltration and related hazardous conditions at the Premises after notice;

B. Compensatory damages to compensate Plaintiff for personal property damage (approx. $400), increased utility costs, diminution in the value of Plaintiff’s leasehold, and other consequential damages in an amount to be proven at trial;

C. Pre- and post-judgment interest on all monetary awards to the extent allowed by law;

D. An order compelling Defendant to repair the water infiltration and related code violations (specific performance/mandatory injunctive relief), or in the alternative, a declaration of Plaintiff's rights with respect to abatement, repair, and offsets against rent in accordance with Massachusetts law and precedent;

E. Costs of suit, reasonable attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law or equity (including any statutory authority found applicable), and expert and inspection costs;

F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
