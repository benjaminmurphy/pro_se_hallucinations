  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a residential lease, the start date of tenancy (\u00b6\u00b61.1, 1.3, 3.1), monthly rent amount, and that Defendant is landlord/owner/manager of the premises (\u00b6\u00b61.2\u20131.3), which sufficiently pleads a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges repeated notifications to Defendant and Defendant\u2019s repeated failure to take timely or effective action to repair the leak and remediate dampness/mold, plus affirmative minimization statements by Defendant (\u00b6\u00b63.3\u20133.4, 3.7), which plead an omission and related conduct by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads ongoing and worsening water intrusion (\u00b6\u00b63.3, 3.5), physical damage to property (ruined laptop, \u00b63.5), persistent musty odor, headaches, and that Plaintiff was forced to move her bed and limit use of the unit to roughly half the apartment (\u00b6\u00b63.6, 3.8), facts that adequately allege a material/substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the leaks recurred in the exact location observed pre-lease, that Plaintiff notified Defendant, and that Defendant\u2019s failure to repair/remediate allowed the leaks and resulting conditions to continue, causing property damage and loss of use (\u00b6\u00b63.2\u20133.7, 4.3), which adequately pleads proximate causation between Defendant\u2019s conduct/omission and the interference."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint specifies $900 in replacement cost for the ruined laptop (\u00b63.5, 5.1(a)), requests additional damages for loss of use/diminution in rental value, alleges physical discomfort and inconvenience (\u00b6\u00b63.6, 5.1(b)), and seeks costs/interest (\u00b6\u00b64.5, 5.1(c)), thereby pleading actual damages."
