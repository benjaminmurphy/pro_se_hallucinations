COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jason Smith ("Plaintiff"), by and through pro se, respectfully alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jason Smith is an individual and resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center ("Defendant") operates an after‑school youth program at 45 Thatcher St., Brockton, Massachusetts, where the events described below occurred and where Defendant conducts business and activities.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the negligence giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton, Bristol County, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business and maintains the facility at the location where the incident occurred.

4. This action is timely. Plaintiff’s cause of action accrued on September 15, 2023. This Complaint is filed within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight‑year‑old son was participating in an after‑school program operated by Defendant at the Brockton Community Center located at 45 Thatcher St., Brockton, MA.

6. Defendant advertises and represents that children in its after‑school program will be supervised at all times while using the gymnasium and participating in gym activities.

7. On the date in question, Defendant scheduled two staff members to supervise approximately twenty children in the gym. One staff member left the gym to perform paperwork in the office, leaving a single staff member present to supervise the children.

8. The remaining staff member was positioned near the bleachers and was primarily looking at her phone. Two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood gym floor.

9. Several children informed the staff member that the boys were playing roughly. The staff member ignored the complaints and responded "boys will be boys," failing to intervene, separate the children, or otherwise exercise reasonable supervision.

10. During this unsupervised, rough play, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s son with significant force. Plaintiff’s son struck his head on the hardwood floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.

11. Plaintiff’s son was transported to the emergency room and diagnosed with a concussion. As a result of the injury, Plaintiff’s son missed several days of school and required medical treatment and follow‑up care.

12. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses to date as a direct and proximate result of the concussion sustained during the incident at Defendant’s facility. Plaintiff has not claimed lost wages.

13. The injuries, damages, and losses described above were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, as alleged below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the children lawfully on its premises, including Plaintiff’s son, to supervise activities in the gymnasium, to maintain a safe environment, and to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm. This duty arises from Defendant’s role as operator of an after‑school program, Defendant’s representations that children would be supervised at all times, and basic tort principles imposing a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing physical harm to invitees and program participants. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 323, § 324A; see also Massachusetts decisions recognizing duties to protect invitees and program participants from foreseeable harm (see, e.g., cases cited below).

16. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. Failing to provide adequate supervision in the gym by permitting one staff member to be solely responsible for approximately twenty children;
    b. Allowing the sole supervising staff member to divert attention to a personal electronic device and not to actively supervise the children;
    c. Failing to intervene when informed by children that older boys were playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood;
    d. Failing to enforce rules or otherwise take reasonable steps to separate rough players and prevent dangerous conduct;
    e. Failing to provide adequate training, staffing, and supervision policies reasonably necessary to protect young children from foreseeable injuries.

17. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff’s son, including the concussion, the loss of consciousness, pain and suffering, medical expenses, and other damages described herein.

18. The injuries were foreseeable. It was foreseeable that permitting unsupervised, rough tackle play among children — particularly with a lone distracted supervisor — could result in serious bodily injury, including head injuries and concussions.

19. By reason of the foregoing negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages:
    a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $4,500 (past and ongoing);
    b. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life by Plaintiff’s child in an amount to be proven at trial;
    c. Costs of this action, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

20. The elements of negligence under Massachusetts law are well established: (1) duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and (4) damages. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282; Massachusetts jurisprudence recognizing these elements. See, e.g., Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (concept of foreseeability); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 291-300 (duty and foreseeability); Restatement (Second) § 324A (liability for negligent performance of an undertaking).

21. Massachusetts statutory and procedural authorities relevant to this action include, but are not limited to:
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (personal injury statute of limitations);
    - Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 8(e), 9(b), 10, and 11 (pleadings and signature requirements);

22. Massachusetts and other decisional authorities on negligent supervision, premises liability, and duties to protect invitees and program participants include, by way of example and illustration:
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 324A (negligent performance of an undertaking);
    - Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability principles);
    - Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (House of Lords) (neighbor principle and duty of care);
    - Prosser & Keeton on Torts (general treatise on premises liability and negligence);
    - Additional Massachusetts authorities recognizing duty and liability in similar premises/supervision contexts and establishing standards for negligence in supervision and child safety: e.g., cases addressing negligence in school or recreational settings and negligent supervision (Mass. cases and decisions addressing foreseeability, duty to supervise, and premises liability are persuasive here).

(Notes: Plaintiff cites the Restatement and standard tort authorities for the general principles that Defendant owed and breached a duty of reasonable care by failing to supervise and to prevent foreseeable harm. Plaintiff will rely at trial on common law negligence principles as recognized in Massachusetts and applicable authorities on premises liability and negligent supervision.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:
    1. Past medical expenses of approximately $4,500 and future medical expenses as proved at trial;
    2. Compensatory damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life suffered by Plaintiff’s son, in an amount to be proven at trial;
    3. Such other damages as are proven at trial.

B. Awarding pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest at the lawful rate;

C. Awarding costs and disbursements of this action, including filing fees, service of process costs, and reasonable costs of investigation and document production;

D. Granting a trial by jury on all triable issues; and

E. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
