COMPLAINT
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Mass. law)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Tran (“Plaintiff”) is a resident of Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851.
1.2 Defendant Linda Harrison (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851, and may be served at that address.
1.3 This action is brought in the District Court of Lowell pursuant to Massachusetts venue and jurisdictional rules because the subject residential premises and the events giving rise to this complaint are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.
1.4 Plaintiff commenced occupancy of the subject premises on or about June 1, 2020, pursuant to a month-to-month residential tenancy for which Plaintiff pays $1,200.00 in rent each month.
1.5 Plaintiff brings this action pro se for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

2. Statement of Claim — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
2.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1.1 through 1.5 as though fully set forth herein.
2.2 At all times relevant to this complaint Defendant was the landlord of the rental premises and owed duties to Plaintiff as tenant, including the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, obligations to provide and maintain premises fit for human habitation, and to remedy conditions that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 5.1 et seq.).
2.3 Beginning in or about 2025, Plaintiff discovered visible mold growth in the bathroom of the rental unit. The mold first appeared in the corner of the shower and has since spread to the bathroom ceiling.
2.4 Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition and asked that it be remediated and that adequate ventilation be provided to prevent recurrence. Defendant inspected the bathroom but refused to address ventilation or any structural or mechanical causes of the mold, asserting that Plaintiff “caused” the problem by not running the exhaust fan “enough” and by taking showers that are “too hot and too long.” Defendant stated she would “clean” existing mold but would not remedy ventilation or other causes.
2.5 The bathroom contains no operable window; the only ventilation provided is the ceiling exhaust fan. Plaintiff does run the exhaust fan when she showers, although she may not run it after every single shower; regardless, the sole mechanical ventilation is inadequate to prevent moisture accumulation and mold growth given the unit’s configuration and Defendant’s failure to ensure adequate ventilation and remediation of conditions conducive to mold.
2.6 Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced new and worsening respiratory symptoms, including coughing, nasal congestion, and wheezing. Plaintiff sought treatment from a physician, who determined that Plaintiff’s respiratory symptoms are likely related to mold exposure and advised remediation of the mold and avoidance of the contaminated environment.
2.7 As a direct and proximate result of the mold, Plaintiff was forced to discard a shower curtain and some towels which became contaminated (approximately $60.00 in personal property loss), and Plaintiff has suffered physical discomfort and diminished use and enjoyment of the rented premises.
2.8 Defendant’s refusal to correct the conditions that cause and perpetuate mold at the premises, and Defendant’s insistence that the problem is solely caused by Plaintiff’s personal habits despite the lack of adequate ventilation and ongoing spread of mold, amounts to a material interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and of the landlord’s duty to provide and maintain premises in a habitable condition (see Javins, 428 F.2d 1071; Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); Park West Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.).
2.9 Defendant’s conduct in refusing to remediate the source of mold and failing to maintain adequate ventilation jeopardizes Plaintiff’s health and safety and materially impairs Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the premises as a residence. Defendant’s conduct is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all residential tenancies under Massachusetts law and common law principles (see, e.g., Javins, supra; Hilder, supra; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant).

3. Legal Basis — Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; Statutory and Regulatory Support
3.1 The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every lease, and a landlord’s wrongful interference with a tenant’s possession, or failure to remedy conditions that materially impair the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the property, gives rise to a cause of action for breach of that covenant (see Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1).
3.2 Massachusetts public health statutes and regulations impose duties on landlords to maintain housing that is safe and sanitary. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code sets minimum standards of fitness for human habitation and requires landlords to correct conditions that create health hazards, including conditions that promote dampness and mold (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §§ 127 et seq., authorizing the State Sanitary Code).
3.3 Where a landlord fails to remedy a condition that materially interferes with habitability or the tenant’s enjoyment of the premises — especially where the condition affects health, such as mold growth and inadequate ventilation — the tenant may seek damages and equitable relief for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and other remedies at law and equity (see Javins, supra; Hilder, supra; Park West, supra; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 5.1, 8.1).
3.4 The Court may consider persuasive authority from jurisdictions recognizing landlord duties with respect to habitability and mold and awarding tenants relief where landlords fail to address conditions that materially interfere with tenancy; such authorities include cases addressing implied warranty of habitability and quiet enjoyment (see also Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (warranty of habitability principles); Hilder, 478 A.2d 202).

4. Facts Supporting Damages and Relief Requested
4.1 Plaintiff alleges damages in the amount of $500.00 inclusive of personal property loss ($60.00), physical and emotional distress, diminution in rental value and use and enjoyment, and other consequential damages resulting from Defendant’s breach.
4.2 In addition to money damages, Plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief ordering Defendant to promptly: (a) retain a qualified professional to assess and remediate the mold; (b) repair and/or upgrade the bathroom ventilation (including, if necessary, replacement or repair of the exhaust fan or installation of appropriate ventilation mechanisms) to prevent recurrence; and (c) perform such repairs and maintenance as required to bring the premises into compliance with the State Sanitary Code, Massachusetts law, and the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
4.3 Plaintiff further requests an award of costs, pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, and any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.

5. Causes of Action
COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts law)
5.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1.1 through 4.3 as if fully set forth herein.
5.2 Defendant’s failure to remediate mold conditions and to provide or arrange for effective ventilation and Defendant’s refusal to address conditions that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the tenancy. Such breach has caused actual and provable damages to Plaintiff including physical harm, property loss, loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and other damages.
5.3 WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests relief as set forth in the Prayer for Relief below.

Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant and grant the following relief:
A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s duty to maintain premises fit for human habitation;
B. An order directing Defendant to promptly retain an appropriate, qualified professional to inspect and remediate all mold and mold contamination in the unit and building and to repair, replace, or otherwise correct ventilation and any other structural or mechanical defects that materially contributed to mold growth and the hazardous condition;
C. Monetary damages in the amount of at least $500.00 for personal property loss, physical and emotional distress, diminished use and enjoyment of the premises, and other consequential damages, plus interest;
D. Costs of suit and court fees;
E. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;
F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including equitable relief to secure safe, habitable conditions at the premises.
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
