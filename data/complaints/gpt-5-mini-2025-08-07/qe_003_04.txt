COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Monroe (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and tenant residing at 245 Centre Street, Apartment [Studio], Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.
1.2 Defendant Samuel Larkin (“Defendant”) is the landlord and owner/manager of the premises located at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130, and may be served at that address.
1.3 Plaintiff executed a residential lease and began tenancy at the premises on January 15, 2023, and has paid rent of $1,450.00 per month since that date.
1.4 This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and housing jurisdiction) and general jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court over landlord–tenant claims arising in Boston/Housing Court’s territorial jurisdiction.
1.5 Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the premises at issue are located in Jamaica Plain (Boston Housing Court).

2. Nature of the Action
2.1 This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, seeking damages for Defendant’s material interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and for damage to Plaintiff’s personal property resulting from Defendant’s failure to repair repeated water infiltration and resulting conditions.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1 On or about January 15, 2023, Plaintiff moved into a studio apartment at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, pursuant to a residential lease and on a month-to-month/term basis (the “Premises”).
3.2 During the pre-lease showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the living room/ceiling area and asked Defendant about them. Defendant stated the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.” Relying on Defendant’s representation, Plaintiff entered into the tenancy.
3.3 During the first major rainstorm after Plaintiff moved in, water began dripping through the ceiling in the same location where the stains had been observed. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant and repeatedly complained thereafter about ongoing leakage and water infiltration.
3.4 Defendant repeatedly downplayed the problem, referring to it as a “minor cosmetic issue” and stating that Plaintiff had accepted the unit’s “character” when signing the lease.
3.5 The leaks continued and worsened over time. During one storm, water poured through the ceiling in sufficient quantity to soak Plaintiff’s couch and to ruin Plaintiff’s laptop computer, which Plaintiff had placed on the coffee table. The laptop required replacement at a cost of approximately $900.00.
3.6 As a result of ongoing leakage, Plaintiff now lives with a persistent musty odor in the affected area, has experienced regular headaches that she believes are caused by mold or damp conditions, and has been forced to move her bed away from the wetter area, effectively reducing her use of the Premises by about half.
3.7 Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the worsening conditions and requested repairs and remediation of the source of the leak, but Defendant has failed to take timely or effective action to repair the leak or remediate resulting dampness and mold conditions.
3.8 Defendant’s failure to repair the roof/ceiling and eliminate water intrusion has materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property (the laptop), and caused Plaintiff ongoing discomfort and reduced habitability of the Premises.

4. Legal Claim — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts)
4.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
4.2 Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment that guarantees the tenant’s right to possession and the landlord’s duty not to interfere materially with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. A landlord breaches that covenant by conduct or omission that substantially interferes with a tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises, including by failure to remedy conditions that render the premises uninhabitable or substantially less usable (constructive eviction/constructive interference).
4.3 Defendant’s repeated failure to repair ongoing water infiltration and to remediate resulting dampness, musty conditions, and suspected mold—after being notified—constitutes a material, substantial, and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises and thus a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
4.4 Defendant’s failure also caused direct damage to Plaintiff’s personal property (the laptop) and resulted in a partial loss of use of the Premises (Plaintiff forced to live in roughly half of the apartment and suffer headaches), entitling Plaintiff to damages for loss of use, diminution in the rental value of the premises, damage to personal property, and other compensable losses.
4.5 Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover actual damages, costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

5. Damages
5.1 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:
  a. Damages to personal property in the amount of $900.00 (replacement cost of ruined laptop);
  b. Additional damages for diminution of use and enjoyment of the Premises, including loss of use (forced to live in half the apartment), physical discomfort (headaches), emotional distress, and inconvenience (amount to be proved at trial, but Plaintiff estimates a reasonable rent abatement/damages of at least $900.00 in total, exclusive of property damage);
  c. Costs and expenses of this action, statutory interest, and such further relief as the Court deems appropriate.
5.2 Plaintiff has attempted to resolve these issues with Defendant informally but has been unable to obtain adequate repairs or compensation.

6. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:
  a. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $900.00 for replacement of ruined personal property (laptop), plus additional compensatory damages for loss of use and diminution in rental value (in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $900.00);
  b. Award pre- and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
  c. Award costs of suit and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable, including any rent abatement the Court finds appropriate for the period of diminished use;
  d. Any other relief the Court deems proper.

7. Demand for Jury Trial
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
