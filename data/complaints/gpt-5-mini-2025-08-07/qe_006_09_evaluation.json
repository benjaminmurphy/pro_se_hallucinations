St. Peter is a leading Vermont decision expressly adopting the implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, treating leases as contracts with interdependent landlord and tenant obligations, and detailing landlord repair duties and tenant remedies (rent abatement, repair-and-deduct, damages). The court relies explicitly on Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway and other modern warranty-of-habitability precedents, making it a representative and influential case on these landlord-tenant doctrines; while it focuses more on habitability than on quiet enjoyment per se, it clearly supports the core proposition regarding implied habitability warranty and landlord repair obligations that Massachusetts courts consider.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTherefore, we now hold expressly that in the rental of any residential dwelling unit an implied warranty exists in the lease, whether oral or written, that the landlord will deliver over and maintain, throughout the period of the tenancy, premises that are safe, clean and fit for human habitation\u2026 Because we hold that the lease of a residential dwelling creates a contractual relationship between the landlord and tenant, the standard contract remedies of rescission, reformation and damages are available to the tenant when suing for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.\u201d"
