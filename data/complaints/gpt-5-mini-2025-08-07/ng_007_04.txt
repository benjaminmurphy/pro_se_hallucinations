COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Michael Johnson, pro se, and for his complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Michael Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Johnson”) is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) operates an after-school program and community recreation facility located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301. On information and belief, Defendant is an entity that owns, operates, supervises, and controls the activities and personnel at that facility.

3. The events giving rise to this Complaint occurred at the Community Center’s gymnasium located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301 on September 15, 2023.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Brockton District Court pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules and applicable statutory and common law because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Brockton and the Defendant conducts business in Brockton.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all times relevant, the Community Center operated an after-school program that advertised and held itself out as providing supervision for children participating in activities in the gymnasium.

6. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son (“the child”) attended the after-school program at the Community Center. The program that day had approximately twenty children in the gym.

7. Defendant represented and had an obligation to provide adequate supervision consistent with its advertised representations and with ordinary care for the safety of children in the program.

8. That day the program was to be staffed by two adults supervising the children in the gym. One staff member left the gym to do paperwork in the office, leaving only one staff member present to supervise approximately twenty children on the gym hardwood floor.

9. The lone staff member remaining in the gym was primarily using her cellular phone and positioned near the bleachers, failing to actively supervise the children playing on the gym floor.

10. Two older boys, approximately twelve years of age, began playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor. Several children reported the dangerous conduct to the staff member. The staff member responded, “boys will be boys,” and failed to intervene, stop the rough play, or separate the children.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to provide adequate supervision and to intervene, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son. The tackle was forceful; the child struck his head on the hardwood floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.

12. Emergency medical care was sought. The child was taken to a hospital emergency department where he was diagnosed with a concussion. The child required follow-up care and missed several days of school. The concussion and its sequelae caused physical pain, emotional distress, and inconvenience.

13. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,500 in medical expenses related to the child’s injuries and has suffered lost wages of approximately $1,200 as a result of time spent obtaining medical care and managing the child’s care following the incident. Plaintiff continues to address ongoing medical and other consequences of the injury.

14. All acts and omissions of Defendant were negligent and were a proximate cause of the child’s injuries and Plaintiff’s damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all times material hereto, Defendant owed a duty to exercise ordinary care for the safety of invitees and program participants, including the children attending its after-school program. This duty included maintaining reasonably safe premises and providing adequate supervision of children engaged in activities in the gymnasium.

17. Defendant breached its duty of care in one or more of the following particulars (without limitation):

   a. Failing to provide adequate supervision by staffing the gym with only one adult when two adults were required and reasonably necessary to supervise twenty children engaging in physical activity;

   b. Allowing a staff member to remain inattentive and primarily on her cellular phone near the bleachers rather than actively overseeing children on the gym floor;

   c. Failing to respond reasonably and immediately to reports by children about unsafe, rough play by older children;

   d. Failing to stop or prevent a dangerous game of rough tackling on a hard-surfaced gym floor;

   e. Failing to implement or follow reasonable policies, procedures, or training regarding supervision of children in physical activities; and

   f. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s aforementioned negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son was tackled, struck his head on the floor, lost consciousness, and suffered a concussion and related injuries, causing medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, disability, inconvenience, and other damages described above.

19. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses (approximately $5,500), lost wages (approximately $1,200), pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

GOVERNING LAW; ELEMENTS OF NEGLIGENCE; AUTHORITY

20. Plaintiff alleges negligence under Massachusetts law. To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff; (2) that the defendant breached that duty; and (3) that the breach was a proximate cause of damages to the plaintiff. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (duty to invitees and entrants); see generally Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause principles); Massachusetts General Laws and applicable Massachusetts decisions recognize and apply these principles to premises liability and supervision claims.

21. Defendant, as the operator of a facility offering programs for children and as an occupier of premises open to the public for recreation, owed an affirmative duty to supervise and to exercise ordinary care to protect participants from foreseeable harm. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 321 (causation). The risk of injury from rough play involving older and younger children on a hard gym surface was foreseeable and preventable through proper supervision and intervention.

22. The Massachusetts statute of limitations for personal injury actions is three (3) years from the date of injury. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A. Plaintiff timely brings this action within that statutory period. (The injury occurred on September 15, 2023; this Complaint is filed December 1, 2025.)

23. The foregoing legal authorities and standards include, without limitation, the Restatement (Second) of Torts (and sections cited above), governing Massachusetts negligence law and standards applied by Massachusetts courts for duty, breach, causation, and damages. Plaintiff will rely at trial on those authorities and on controlling Massachusetts case law applying these principles to premises liability and supervision of minors.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Michael Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Brockton Community Center as follows:

A. Compensatory damages for medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,500;

B. Compensatory damages for lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200;

C. Compensatory damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and related non-economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial;

D. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

E. Costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable under law;

F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
