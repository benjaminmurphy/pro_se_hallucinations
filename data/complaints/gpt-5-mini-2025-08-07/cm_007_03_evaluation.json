The opinion instead analyzes whether a statutory evidentiary requirement for proving paternity is substantially related to state interests in orderly estate administration. Thus, citing Lalli v. Lalli for the broad proposition that parental rights are subject to fair process mischaracterizes the holding.",

We therefore find no violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d"

The plurality holds that a statute allowing courts to override a fit parent\u2019s visitation decisions based solely on the judge\u2019s independent best\u2011interests determination, without giving special weight to the parent\u2019s decision, violates due process. It thus is directly on point for \u201cparental rights and best interests standard considerations.\u201d",

The Washington nonparental visitation statute is breathtakingly broad\u2026 Once the visitation petition has been filed\u2026 a parent's decision that visitation would not be in the child's best interest is accorded no deference. Section 26.10.160(3) contains no requirement that a court accord the parent's decision any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever. Instead, the Washington statute places the best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge.\u201d"
