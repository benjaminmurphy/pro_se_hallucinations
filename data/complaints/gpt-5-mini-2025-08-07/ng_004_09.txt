COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jacob Adams, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Linda Greene, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jacob Adams is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Linda Greene is the owner of the three-unit apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Property”). At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant owned, controlled, and was responsible for maintenance of the sidewalk adjacent to the Property.

3. The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred on February 15, 2023, on the sidewalk adjacent to 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Worcester District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester and the Defendant’s property is located in Worcester.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

6. On or about February 15, 2023, following a snowstorm and temporary clearing efforts, Defendant or her agents shoveled a narrow path down the center of the sidewalk adjacent to the Property but did not apply salt, sand, grit, or any other de-icing material to the shoveled path or adjacent sidewalk areas.

7. Over the next several days after the storm, daytime melting and overnight refreezing transformed the narrow cleared path into a smooth sheet of ice, creating an unreasonable and dangerous condition for pedestrians using the sidewalk.

8. Plaintiff was lawfully on the sidewalk on February 15, 2023 while delivering groceries to one of the tenants of the building. Plaintiff proceeded up the sidewalk along the cleared path in the normal course of his duties.

9. As Plaintiff walked on the area of ice created by the Defendant’s incomplete and unsafe post-storm maintenance, his feet slipped out from under him and he fell backward, landing forcefully on his lower back.

10. Plaintiff’s fall resulted from the hazardous ice condition described above.

11. After the fall, tenants of the building informed Plaintiff that they had previously contacted Defendant by text message and had provided photographs of the icy condition, and that Defendant responded to those communications by stating, “the sun will take care of it.”

12. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that the narrow cleared path without de-icing would become icy, especially given the known pattern of melting and refreezing during the days and nights after the storm, and knew or should have known that the condition created an unreasonable risk of harm to persons using the sidewalk.

13. As a direct and proximate result of the fall caused by the hazardous condition on the sidewalk, Plaintiff sustained injury to his lower back, incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500, missed approximately one week of work and lost wages of approximately $800, and suffered pain, disability, and other damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully on or near the sidewalk, including the Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of latent or hidden dangers of which she knew or should have known.

16. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. failing to place salt, sand, grit, or other de-icing material on the cleared path or adjacent sidewalk areas after the snowstorm;
    b. leaving a narrow cleared path that predictably became a sheet of ice due to daily melting and nightly refreezing;
    c. failing to repair, remedy, or otherwise make reasonably safe the hazardous ice condition after receipt of complaints and photographic notice from tenants; and
    d. failing to warn lawful pedestrians, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition.

17. Defendant’s breach was negligent and was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries, medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but presently approximately totaling $3,300 (comprising approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and approximately $800 in lost wages), together with damages for pain, suffering, disability, loss of enjoyment of life, interest, costs, and such other relief as this Court may deem proper.

APPLICABLE LAW (Legal Basis and Authorities)

19. The elements of negligence under Massachusetts law are duty, breach, causation and damages. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §282; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (owner or occupier of land has a duty to use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees). Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized landowners’ duty to maintain sidewalks and other parts of their premises in a reasonably safe condition and their liability for injuries caused by hazardous conditions they create or allow to exist. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§343–344; see also Massachusetts common law on premises liability.

20. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner may be liable for failing to remedy or warn of dangerous snow- and ice-related conditions where the condition is foreseeable and the landowner knew or should have known of it; notice and opportunity to remedy are factors to be considered. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §343; Massachusetts cases addressing owner/occupier responsibilities with respect to hazardous conditions and notice.

21. Plaintiff brings this Count pursuant to Massachusetts common law negligence principles and applicable statutes, including the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, §2A (statute of limitations for actions of tort for personal injuries).

22. Plaintiff expressly reserves the right to rely on additional statutes, rules, regulations, and caselaw developed by Massachusetts appellate courts and the Supreme Judicial Court that are relevant to premises liability, notice, foreseeability, and the measure of damages in negligence actions.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

23. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against the Defendant as follows:

A. Awards of compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, past and future lost earnings and earning capacity, and compensation for pain, suffering, disability, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Costs of suit and interest as allowed by law;

C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
