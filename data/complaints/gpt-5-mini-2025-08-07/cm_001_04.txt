v.

Michael TURNER
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING SCHEDULE

1. Parties and Children
   - Plaintiff: Jessica Turner, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com.
   - Defendant: Michael Turner (last known address: [address on court file / unknown to Plaintiff]).
   - Children subject to the existing order: Liam Turner (born 2017; age 8) and Ava Turner (born 2019; age 6).

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   - This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law governing custody, parenting schedules and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209B, because the parties and children are domiciled in Massachusetts and the Probate and Family Court entered the existing custody/parenting order.
   - Venue is proper in Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the parties and the children reside within the county and the prior order was entered in this Court.

3. Prior Court Order
   - On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a custody/parenting order awarding primary residential custody to Plaintiff, with Defendant having parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week (the “Existing Order”). A copy of the Existing Order is in the court file.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   - Since entry of the Existing Order, and within the last several months, Defendant has materially changed his work schedule without modification of the Existing Order.
   - Defendant accepted new employment with scheduled hours approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. several nights per week. These night-shift hours frequently coincide with or follow the nights Defendant is scheduled to have an overnight with the children under the Existing Order.
   - As a result of this change, Defendant (a) has on multiple occasions dropped the children back at Plaintiff’s residence with little or no advance notice because he has stated he is too tired to watch them after his night shift; (b) has left the children at Plaintiff’s residence immediately after his shift, sometimes in the middle of the night; (c) has on more than one occasion left the children in the care of his roommate (whose identity and background Plaintiff does not know and who Plaintiff has not approved as a caregiver); and (d) the children have told Plaintiff that Defendant frequently naps on the couch after returning from work and the children often fall asleep there while in his care.
   - These changes were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the Existing Order was entered and constitute a material change in circumstances that affects the children’s health, safety, routine, and welfare and undermines the parenting-time arrangement in the Existing Order.

5. Facts Demonstrating Need for Modification
   - The night-shift schedule prevents Defendant from being meaningfully awake, attentive and available during the overnights he currently is scheduled to exercise, creating potential safety and supervision issues for young children (ages 8 and 6).
   - The children’s statements that they fall asleep on the couch while Defendant naps, combined with Defendant’s practice of leaving the children with an unknown roommate or returning them at odd hours with little notice, creates a disruption to the children’s sleep routines, schooling, extracurricular schedules, and emotional stability.
   - Plaintiff has attempted informal accommodation and communication with Defendant regarding his work schedule and the children’s needs; Defendant’s schedule frequently changes and Defendant has not proposed a reliable, safe alternative to the presently scheduled overnights that would address the children’s needs or Plaintiff’s concerns.
   - For the foregoing reasons, modification of the Existing Order is necessary to ensure the children’s safety, continuity of care, and to promote their best interests.

6. Legal Standard
   - Plaintiff alleges that the foregoing facts constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order sufficient to warrant modification of the parenting schedule and custody-related terms. Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification must show a material change in circumstances since the prior order and that modification is in the best interests of the child(ren). Plaintiff seeks relief consistent with those legal standards.

7. Relief Requested
   Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   A. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order and that modification is necessary to protect the safety, welfare, routine, and best interests of Liam and Ava Turner.
   B. Modify the Existing Order to provide that:
      1. Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall only occur on nights when Defendant is not scheduled to work night shifts (i.e., Defendant shall not have overnight parenting time on any day following a scheduled night shift of 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., or similar hours) unless the parties agree in writing otherwise in advance.
      2. Defendant shall provide Plaintiff with reasonably reliable written notice of his regular work schedule at least two weeks in advance, and promptly notify Plaintiff of any changes to his schedule (including pickup/drop-off times) as soon as he becomes aware of the change.
      3. Defendant shall provide the name, address, phone number, and relationship of any third party (including any roommate or other household member) who will regularly be responsible for caring for the children during Defendant’s parenting time; Plaintiff may object to any proposed caregiver for good cause, and the Court may require background information or disclosure as appropriate.
      4. Defendant shall not leave the children unattended or in the care of an unapproved person during his parenting time and shall ensure adequate supervision at all times.
      5. The Court order a defined and enforceable schedule that reflects Defendant’s availability (for example, shifting the midweek overnight to a daytime/evening visit when Defendant is not on night shift, or limiting overnights to weekend periods when Defendant is not scheduled for night shifts).
   C. Order any temporary relief the Court deems just and equitable pending final hearing, including an interim order suspending Defendant’s overnights on days immediately following scheduled night shifts until the parties can be heard on a permanent modification.
   D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs, fees, and all other relief permitted by law.

8. Request for Hearing and Notice
   - Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court schedule a hearing on this Complaint for Modification at the Court’s earliest convenience and that the Court issue any necessary orders for temporary relief pending that hearing.
   - Plaintiff requests that the Court direct service of this Complaint on Defendant at his last known address, or in accordance with applicable rules for substitute service if necessary.

9. Verification
   - I, Jessica Turner, declare under penalties of perjury that the facts set forth in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT AUTHORITIES AND LEGAL CITATIONS
I have prepared the foregoing Complaint using the facts and relief you provided. You asked that I include statutory and case law citations. I must be careful not to provide inaccurate or fabricated legal citations. Preparation of a finalized pleading that cites the controlling Massachusetts statutes and applicable case law (including specific decisions interpreting the “material change in circumstances” standard and best-interests factors) is best done with review by a licensed Massachusetts attorney to ensure accuracy and to include all legally relevant authorities (statutes, rules, and Massachusetts caselaw) that support the requested modification.

If you would like, I can:
- prepare a version of the Complaint with suggested legal authority placeholders for your attorney or for Legal Aid to fill in; or
- provide a list of commonly-cited Massachusetts authorities and cases on custody modification for you to show to an attorney or to the court clerk (I will confirm those citations before inclusion).
