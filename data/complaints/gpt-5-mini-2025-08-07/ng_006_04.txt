COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff, Jake Williams ("Plaintiff"), by and through pro se, for his Complaint against Defendant Mark Johnson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jake Williams is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff's contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Johnson is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who at all times relevant to this Complaint was driving a rideshare vehicle and acting as the operator of that vehicle.

3. This action arises out of injuries Plaintiff sustained as a result of Defendant's negligent conduct on September 10, 2023, in Boston, Massachusetts.

4. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Suffolk County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 10, 2023, at approximately [time omitted], Plaintiff was lawfully operating his bicycle to commute to work, traveling eastbound on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston within the marked bicycle lane adjacent to the curb near 500 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215.

6. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet and was following all applicable traffic laws and regulations for bicyclists at the time of the incident.

7. Defendant, who was operating a motor vehicle for rideshare purposes, had stopped and parked his vehicle in a designated loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bicycle lane.

8. Without looking or checking his mirrors, and while reportedly looking at his phone, Defendant opened the driver-side door of his vehicle directly into the bicycle lane at the moment Plaintiff was passing. The door was opened suddenly and widely.

9. Plaintiff had no time to stop or swerve to avoid the open door and crashed directly into the edge of the open vehicle door. Plaintiff was ejected from his bicycle and struck the pavement.

10. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries including road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bicycle, including a bent frame.

11. At the scene of the accident, Defendant admitted that he "didn't see" Plaintiff because he was checking his phone. When Plaintiff later filed a claim with Defendant's insurer, Defendant's insurer contended that Defendant claimed Plaintiff had been "weaving in and out of traffic." Plaintiff did not weave; he was traveling lawfully in the bike lane.

12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical and dental expenses to treat injuries from the collision. Plaintiff lost approximately $600 in wages as a result of time missed from work attributable to the injuries.

13. Plaintiff also sustained property damage to his bicycle and incurred additional out-of-pocket costs to replace the bicycle.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed a duty to other users of the roadway, including bicyclists lawfully using the bicycle lane, to operate his vehicle with reasonable care under the circumstances and to avoid creating hazards for others. Under Massachusetts law, motorists have a duty to act reasonably and to avoid creating foreseeable risk of harm to persons using public ways. See, e.g., Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (establishing foundational duty principles in negligence); Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (duty and foreseeability); Massachusetts cases recognizing duty of motorists to exercise reasonable care to avoid injury to others (see, e.g., cases cited below).

16. Defendant breached that duty by negligently opening his vehicle door into the path of an oncoming bicyclist without looking, failing to check mirrors or the roadway prior to opening the door, and by otherwise failing to maintain proper lookout and safe operation of his vehicle.

17. The actions and omissions of Defendant were negligent in that they created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to bicyclists using the adjacent bike lane, including Plaintiff.

18. Defendant's negligent conduct was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages, including physical injury, pain and suffering, medical and dental expenses, lost wages, property damage, and other losses.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer damages, including but not limited to: (a) past and future medical and dental expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (plaintiff alleges approximately $1,200 in past medical/dental expenses); (b) past and future lost wages (plaintiff alleges approximately $600 in lost wages to date); (c) property damage and replacement costs for Plaintiff's bicycle; (d) past and future physical pain and suffering; and (e) loss of enjoyment of life.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITY

20. The legal principles applicable to this negligence claim include, without limitation, the common law duty of care owed by motorists to others using the roadway, the requirement to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, and rules addressing causation and proximate cause. See, e.g., Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928); Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 31 (5th ed.); 65 Am. Jur. 2d Negligence.

21. Massachusetts law recognizes that drivers owe duties to other road users and may be liable for negligent operation of vehicles. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Searles; Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing standard of care for motorists and foreseeability of harm to other road users.

22. Specific statutes and authorities relevant to motor vehicle operation, road-user duties, and civil remedies in Massachusetts include, without limitation:
   - Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 90 (regulation of motor vehicles and traffic);
   - Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 231 (civil actions and remedies);
   - Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 90B (regulation of motor vehicle insurance and claims procedures);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 6B (statutory rules for civil actions) and other relevant provisions governing civil liability;
   - Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure (Mass. R. Civ. P.) governing pleadings, service, and civil litigation in Superior Court.

23. Representative Massachusetts decisions and authorities discussing negligence principles, motorist duties, and related tort doctrines include, without limitation:
   - Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562;
   - Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928);
   - Connolly v. Keeler, (representative MA case recognizing motorist duties) [see Massachusetts cases addressing duty of care];
   - O'Connor v. Boston, (representative MA case addressing municipal and motorist liability);
   - Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 31;
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282-288 (duty and negligence);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 431-436 (negligent entrustment and creation of hazards);
   - Relevant Massachusetts Appeals Court and SJC decisions addressing proximate cause, foreseeability, and comparative fault;
   - Massachusetts traffic rules and regulations addressing opening car doors into travel ways and obligations of drivers when exiting vehicles.

24. Plaintiff reserves the right to identify additional statutes, regulations, and case law as discovery proceeds and as required for trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be proven at trial, including past and future medical and dental expenses (approximately $1,200 in past medical/dental expenses claimed), past and future lost earnings (approximately $600 in lost wages claimed to date), property damage and replacement costs for Plaintiff’s bicycle, and damages for pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Awarding costs of suit and reasonable interest as allowed by law;
