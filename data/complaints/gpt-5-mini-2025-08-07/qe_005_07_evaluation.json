It does not discuss landlord-tenant law, covenants of quiet enjoyment, nuisances, or a landlord\u2019s duty to control tenants. The proposition about a landlord\u2019s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is therefore unrelated to and unsupported by this case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In the present case there is no adequate remedy by way of appeal. Review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, constitutes the only means by which the parents can obtain the relief they seek, the avoidance of a trial de novo. \u2026 Because the juvenile appeals session of the District Court has jurisdiction of this case, there was no error in dismissing the parents\u2019 petition in the nature of a writ of prohibition."
