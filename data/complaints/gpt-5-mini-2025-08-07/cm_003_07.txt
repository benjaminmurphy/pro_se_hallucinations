Michael Smith
     Defendant/Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff/Movant: Emily Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant/Respondent: Michael Smith (last known address in Bristol County, Massachusetts).
1.3 Minor Child: Liam Smith, born in 2016, age 9.
1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Probate and Family Court statutes governing custody and modification of custody orders and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act as enacted in Massachusetts. The existing custody order was entered by this Court on September 15, 2021 (the "Existing Order").

2. Relief Sought
2.1 Plaintiff seeks modification of the Existing Order on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that affects the health, safety, or welfare of the minor child, and that modification is in the minor child’s best interests.
2.2 Specifically, Plaintiff requests:
  a. That overnight visitation with Michael Smith be suspended pending a hearing and, thereafter, that any overnight visitation be supervised by a Court-approved third party or supervised visitation provider;
  b. In the alternative, that the Court impose conditions on visitation including, without limitation, no overnight unsupervised visitation, random alcohol testing or sobriety conditions, restriction on late-night returns, and completion by Respondent of a substance-use assessment and any recommended treatment, and parenting classes;
  c. That the Court grant temporary emergency relief as necessary to protect the child pending final hearing;
  d. Any other relief the Court deems appropriate to protect the child’s health, safety, and welfare and to effectuate the best interests of the child.

3. Procedural Background
3.1 On September 15, 2021, this Court entered the Existing Order establishing shared legal custody of the parties’ minor child, Liam Smith. Under the Existing Order, Liam primarily resides with Plaintiff and visits Respondent on certain weekends.
3.2 The Existing Order was entered after the Court had determined at that time that both parents were capable of co-parenting and that shared legal custody served the minor child’s best interests.

4. Facts Constituting Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, circumstances materially affecting the safety and welfare of Liam have changed in the following respects:
  a. Statements by the Child: Liam has, within the past several months, repeatedly told Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Respondent’s residence and that sometimes Respondent “can’t walk straight.” These statements have caused Plaintiff significant concern for Liam’s safety when in Respondent’s care.
  b. Observational Evidence: A neighbor aware of the familial situation recently (within the past month) recorded and provided to Plaintiff a video that appears to show Respondent stumbling while removing Liam from a vehicle late at night. The timing and circumstances in the video are consistent with Liam’s reports of late-night care at Respondent’s residence and with school observations described below.
  c. School Reports: School personnel have reported to Plaintiff that Liam often appears exhausted and drowsy on Monday mornings; school staff have indicated that Liam’s alertness and engagement are noticeably reduced following weekend visits with Respondent.
  d. Pattern Since Order: At the time the Existing Order was entered on September 15, 2021, the Court was aware of no ongoing pattern of intoxication or other impairment by Respondent that would have suggested a risk to the child; the statements by the child, the video provided by the neighbor, and the school reports represent changed facts and new information bearing on the child’s welfare.
4.2 These allegations, taken together, establish a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that directly affect the child’s health, safety, and welfare and warrant modification of custody and visitation arrangements.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order that affects the child’s welfare and that a modification is in the child’s best interests. The moving party must demonstrate such a change by a preponderance of the evidence. See applicable statutes and case law cited below.
5.2 The Court’s central concern in all custody and visitation matters is the best interests of the child, including the child’s safety, physical and emotional well-being, and the need to protect the child from exposure to substance misuse or other hazardous conduct by a custodial parent.

6. Requested Temporary Relief Pending Hearing
6.1 Plaintiff requests that, pending a full hearing on the merits, the Court issue a temporary order:
  a. Suspending Respondent’s overnight, unsupervised visitation with Liam;
  b. Ordering that any visitation with Respondent be supervised by a Court-approved provider or an agreed-upon adult acceptable to Plaintiff and approved by the Court;
  c. Ordering that Respondent undergo a professional substance-use assessment and, if recommended, engage in treatment, provide proof of compliance to the Court, and submit to random testing as the Court may order;
  d. Ordering any other interim relief the Court deems necessary to protect the child.
6.2 The evidence described in Paragraph 4 above demonstrates a sufficient basis for temporary emergency measures to protect Liam’s safety while this motion is pending.

7. Best Interests Factors
7.1 The Court should consider the statutory and judicially articulated best-interests factors, including but not limited to:
  a. The child’s safety and welfare;
  b. The child’s relationship with each parent and each parent’s ability to provide care and protect the child;
  c. Any history of substance abuse or impairment that affects parental capacity;
  d. The child’s established custodial routine and living arrangements;
  e. Any other factor the Court deems relevant to the child’s best interests.
7.2 Applying these factors to the facts alleged above supports the requested modification.

8. Reservation of Rights
8.1 Plaintiff reserves the right to adduce additional evidence, to request a guardian ad litem or child psychological evaluation if appropriate, and to request any additional relief justified by further developments.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order sufficient to warrant modification of custody or visitation;
b. Modify the Existing Order by suspending unsupervised overnight visitation with Respondent and by ordering supervised visitation or other appropriate conditions (including, inter alia, substance-use assessment and compliance, random testing, and parenting classes);
c. Grant temporary emergency relief as requested in Paragraph 6 above pending final hearing;
d. Schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint;
e. Award any other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child.

Plaintiff requests that service be made upon Respondent at his last known address and that all notices and pleadings be sent to Plaintiff at the contact information provided above.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Emily Johnson

Pro se Plaintiff

Authorities (statutes and cases commonly applied in Massachusetts custody-modification matters)
(For convenience, Plaintiff cites the following statutes and Massachusetts authorities commonly relied upon in modification proceedings concerning child custody and visitation and the best interests of the child. Plaintiff requests the Court consider these authorities and any additional controlling statutes, rules, or case law.)

Statutes and Rules
1. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (provisions governing divorce and related custody orders and modifications).
2. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (Abuse Prevention Act) — as relevant to protection orders and safety determinations when abuse or substance-related risk is alleged.
3. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209E (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act) — jurisdictional provisions regarding child custody.
4. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§ 51A and related sections (reporting and investigation of child abuse/neglect) — obligations and standards relevant to child safety concerns.
5. Mass. Prob. & Fam. Ct. Rules of Procedure (as applicable to modification petitions, temporary relief hearings, and evidentiary matters).

Massachusetts Cases (illustrative authorities on modification, material-change standard, and best interests)
6. Custody-modification standard authorities addressing material change and best interests (see e.g., SJC and Appeals Court decisions recognizing the material-change requirement for modification and the best-interests analysis).
7. Cases addressing parental substance abuse and custody adjustments (Massachusetts SJC/Appeals Court decisions recognizing that demonstrated substance misuse may warrant modification or restriction of visitation to protect children).
8. Cases addressing temporary emergency relief in custody disputes where child safety concerns are alleged.
9. Authorities addressing role of school reports, child statements, and third-party evidence in custody proceedings.
10. Cases clarifying that the Court may order supervised visitation, substance-use assessments, and treatment as conditions of visitation when necessary for child safety.

Plaintiff intends to rely on the specific statutes and Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court precedents cited at hearing in support of the above-stated propositions (including, but not limited to, decisions interpreting the material-change standard, best-interests factors, and the Court’s authority to impose conditions on visitation to protect a child).
