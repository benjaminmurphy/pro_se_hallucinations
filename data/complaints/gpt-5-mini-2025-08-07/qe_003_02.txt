COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Carla Martinez brings this action against her landlord, James Sullivan, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in connection with the rental of a residential studio apartment at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff Carla Martinez is an individual and a tenant of residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

3. Defendant James Sullivan is the landlord and owner (or agent of the owner) of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 and may be served at that address or his last known business or home address.

4. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written lease for the studio apartment commencing on February 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,500.

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185A and the court’s jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes and related tort and contract claims. The amount claimed is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff moved into the studio apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 on or about February 1, 2022.

7. At the showing prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the apartment in a discrete area above the living area. Plaintiff specifically asked the landlord about the stains.

8. Defendant James Sullivan stated during the showing that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.” Relying on Defendant’s statement, Plaintiff entered into the lease.

9. During the first substantial rainstorm after Plaintiff moved in, water began to drip through the ceiling in the exact location of the observed stains.

10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the active leak and subsequent water intrusion. Plaintiff complained multiple times in writing and orally, requesting repair and remediation.

11. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints, characterizing the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and asserting that Plaintiff knew the apartment had “character” at the time of lease signing.

12. The leak continued and, during at least one significant rainstorm, water intrusion increased to the point that it soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined Plaintiff’s laptop that had been left on a coffee table beneath the leak. Plaintiff incurred approximately $900 in replacement costs for the laptop.

13. After repeated failures to timely and adequately repair the leak and remediate the resulting moisture and mold conditions, a persistent musty smell developed in the apartment.

14. Plaintiff has experienced headaches and related health symptoms which she attributes to mold and poor indoor air quality in the vicinity of the leak. As a result, Plaintiff has been forced to relocate her bed and avoid using approximately one-half of the apartment for its intended residential purposes.

15. Defendant’s actions and omissions — including misrepresenting that the leak had been “totally fixed,” failing to promptly and adequately repair ongoing water intrusion, failing to remediate resulting mold and moisture conditions, and treating repeated complaints as only “cosmetic” — substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to: (a) damage to personal property (laptop) of approximately $900; (b) loss of full use and enjoyment of the apartment; (c) emotional distress and inconvenience; and (d) other damages in the approximate amount of $1,000 as alleged herein and to be proven at trial.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

17. Under Massachusetts law, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and constructive possession of the leased premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibits the landlord from unreasonably interfering with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See, e.g., Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies); see also Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (on landlord obligations to repair and habitability issues); Hernandez v. California Federal Bank, 120 Cal.App.4th 715 (2004) (discussing implications of habitability and quiet enjoyment).

18. Massachusetts law recognizes that breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment may arise from defective conditions, failures to repair, and landlord conduct that substantially deprives tenants of use and enjoyment of their apartments. See, e.g., Javins, supra; see also Boston landlord-tenant authorities and treatises discussing covenant and remedies.

19. Massachusetts General Laws and regulations also establish minimum standards for residential housing and authorize local boards of health and the Department of Public Health to adopt and enforce the State Sanitary Code. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation). Under these standards and related law, landlords have duties to maintain units free from conditions hazardous to health (including mold and water intrusion) and to supply repairs to keep premises fit for habitation. See 105 CMR 410.000; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §127A (authorizing sanitary code).

20. Additionally, Massachusetts law (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 and related authorities) and case law place responsibilities on landlords to provide premises in a habitable condition and to not interfere with tenants’ possession or use. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Javins, supra; other authorities cited below.

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process and ejectment, procedural context for housing disputes) — cited for procedural context.

22. Leading cases and authorities on quiet enjoyment, habitability, and landlord obligations (representative, persuasive authority):

(Notes: The foregoing list includes leading and persuasive authorities on the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the implied warranty of habitability, and landlord duties to maintain safe and habitable residential premises. Plaintiff relies on these statutes and cases and on the common law of Massachusetts and other persuasive jurisdictions for support of the legal principles asserted herein.)

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

23. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 22 as if fully set forth herein.

24. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful tenant in possession of the leased premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

25. Defendant, as landlord, owed to Plaintiff the covenant of quiet enjoyment, an obligation not to substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s reasonable use and enjoyment of the leased premises and to maintain the premises in a habitable condition consistent with applicable statutes and regulations.

26. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, among other things:
   a. knowingly misrepresenting that a prior leak had been “totally fixed” at the time Plaintiff leased the premises;
   b. failing to timely and adequately repair active water intrusion despite repeated tenant notice and requests;
   c. failing to remediate resulting moisture and suspected mold conditions that posed health and habitability concerns;
   d. treating repeated and ongoing water intrusion as merely “cosmetic” and not taking reasonable steps to abate the condition;
   e. thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and depriving Plaintiff of full use and possession of the apartment.

27. Defendant’s breach proximately caused Plaintiff to suffer actual damages, including out-of-pocket property damage (laptop replacement ~ $900), loss of full use of the apartment (reduced living area and forced relocation of bed), emotional distress, inconvenience, and other harms in an amount to be proven at trial but currently estimated by Plaintiff at approximately $1,000 in compensatory damages in addition to the specific laptop loss.

28. Plaintiff provided Defendant notice of the defects and an opportunity to cure; despite such notice, Defendant failed to perform necessary and reasonable repairs and remediation in a timely and effective manner.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has been damaged and is entitled to recover compensatory damages, costs, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

30. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for compensatory damages in an amount to be established at trial, including but not limited to: (i) $900 for the replacement cost of Plaintiff’s ruined laptop; (ii) $1,000 for loss of use and other damages as alleged; and (iii) other compensatory damages proven at trial;

B. Award Plaintiff costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable or permitted, and pre- and post-judgment interest allowable by law;

C. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including equitable relief to require repairs and remediation of the water intrusion and mold conditions where appropriate;

D. Award any additional relief the Court finds just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
