COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BRISTOL COUNTY – BROCKTON DISTRICT COURT

Ethan Johnson,
    Plaintiff

v.

Brockton Community Center,
    Defendant

Civil Action No.: ___________________

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Ethan Johnson ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Brockton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the parent and legal guardian of the injured child involved in the incident described below.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center ("Defendant") is a community center located and doing business at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Brockton District Court because the incident giving rise to this action occurred at or about 123 Community Center Way in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the Defendant regularly conducts business in Brockton. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

4. This action arises under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for negligence. Plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained by his child as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent supervision and failure to provide reasonably safe conditions and supervision as advertised and required.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

5. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, operated, managed, maintained, and controlled the community center and its after-school programs at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, MA.

6. Defendant advertised and represented that children attending after-school activities at its gym would be supervised at all times by staff.

7. On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old child attended Defendant’s after-school program at the Brockton Community Center gymnasium. The program that day included approximately twenty (20) children and was scheduled to be supervised by two staff members.

8. On March 15, 2023, one of the two staff members assigned to supervise the gym area left the gym area to perform paperwork in the office, leaving only one staff member physically present in the gym.

9. The sole staff member who remained in the gym that day was primarily occupied with her cellular telephone and was positioned near the bleachers rather than actively supervising the children on the gym floor.

10. Two older boys, each approximately twelve (12) years of age, began playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor. A number of the smaller children and other bystanders expressed concern to the staff member about the rough play and asked for intervention.

11. The staff member dismissed or ignored those concerns, stating, in substance, "boys will be boys," and failed to intervene, separate the children, or otherwise take reasonable steps to prevent dangerous conduct.

12. As a direct result of the lack of adequate supervision and Defendant’s failure to intervene, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s eight-year-old child forcefully. The child struck his head on the hardwood floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

13. Plaintiff’s child was transported to a local hospital emergency department, where he was diagnosed with a concussion and treated for confusion and head trauma. He missed several days of school and continues to experience effects from the concussion. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,800.00 and has suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00 as a result of time taken to attend to his child’s medical needs.

14. Defendant’s staff’s actions and omissions, as described above, constituted a breach of the duty of care Defendant owed to program participants, including Plaintiff’s child, to properly supervise children and to maintain reasonably safe conditions and practices in the gym.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 14 above as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff’s child and to other participants in its after-school program to exercise reasonable care in supervising children, to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm, and to maintain safe conditions consistent with its representations and with the standards applicable to providers of child supervision services.

17. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
   a. Failing to provide adequate supervision in the gym on March 15, 2023;
   b. Allowing only one staff member to supervise approximately twenty (20) children when two were scheduled and reasonably required;
   c. Allowing the sole remaining staff member to disengage from supervision by attending to a cell phone and remaining seated near the bleachers rather than actively supervising the children playing on the gym floor;
   d. Failing to intervene or separate older, larger children from younger, smaller children engaging in rough tackle play despite warnings and reports from children and observers that the play was dangerous; and
   e. Failing to take reasonable safety measures, warnings, or enforcement actions that would have prevented the unsafe and foreseeable conduct that caused the injury.

18. Defendant’s breaches were a direct and proximate cause of the injuries, losses, and damages sustained by Plaintiff’s child, and of the economic and non-economic losses sustained by Plaintiff.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:
   a. Past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proved at trial (approximately $5,800.00 to date);
   b. Lost wages in an amount to be proved at trial (approximately $1,200.00 to date);
   c. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages suffered by the injured child;
   d. Costs of suit and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

20. Plaintiff brings this negligence claim under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The elements of negligence under Massachusetts law are duty, breach, causation, and damages. See, e.g., Massachusetts precedent and authority applying these principles and applying the standards for premises liability and for negligent supervision. Plaintiff also relies on recognized tort authorities, including Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (dangerous conditions on land) and § 314A (duty regarding conduct of third persons on premises), as guidance for the duties of possessors of land and operators of programs with respect to supervision and protection of invitees and children on their premises.

(Representative authorities include, without limitation, Massachusetts common law principles recognizing the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect invitees and program participants from foreseeable harms, relevant provisions of the Restatement (Second) of Torts concerning dangerous conditions and the duty to control or protect against third-party conduct, and the procedural rules governing civil actions in Massachusetts. Plaintiff reserves the right to rely on additional statutes, rules, and case law as further developed in discovery and trial.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including past and future medical expenses, lost wages, and other economic losses, in an amount to be proven at trial (including approximately $5,800.00 in past medical expenses and $1,200.00 in lost wages to date);

B. Awarding compensatory damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other non-economic damages sustained by Plaintiff’s child in an amount to be proven at trial;

C. Awarding pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;

D. Awarding costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law;

E. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
