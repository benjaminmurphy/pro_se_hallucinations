  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a lease/tenancy (\u00b63), that Plaintiff pays rent and is a lawful tenant in possession (\u00b63, \u00b65), and that Defendant is the owner/landlord with responsibility for maintenance (\u00b62, \u00b65). These facts sufficiently plead a landlord-tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific landlord conduct: Defendant inspected and acknowledged the mold but refused to repair ventilation or take steps to prevent recurrence, offering only to clean existing mold (\u00b68\u20139, \u00b618). Those allegations state an omission/refusal to act and an affirmative response (cleaning only), adequately pleading landlord conduct. "
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint describes persistent and spreading mold in the bathroom (\u00b66), lack of adequate ventilation (\u00b67), physician-linked respiratory symptoms attributable to mold (\u00b610), loss of personal property (\u00b611), and allegations that conditions made living unhealthy and uncomfortable and substantially interfered with use and enjoyment (\u00b612\u201313, \u00b620). Those facts adequately plead a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. "
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges that Defendant knew or should have known of the mold and refused to remedy the ventilation defect (\u00b68\u20139, \u00b618), and that as a result the mold persisted causing health effects and property loss (\u00b610\u201312, \u00b618\u201320). These allegations sufficiently link the landlord\u2019s omission to the ongoing interference and harm. "
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint specifies out-of-pocket property loss (~$60) (\u00b611), alleges physical symptoms and distress tied to mold exposure (\u00b610, \u00b620), and seeks at least $150 in damages (\u00b612, \u00b620, Prayer B). These allegations adequately plead compensable damages."
