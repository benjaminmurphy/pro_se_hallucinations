Michael Collins
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff: Jessica Collins ("Plaintiff" or "Mother"), residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: Michael Collins ("Defendant" or "Father"), residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
1.3 Minor child: Samantha Collins, born [date of birth omitted here at parent's request], age 12.
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, M.G.L. c. 209C because the parties and child reside in Massachusetts and the prior custody order was entered by this Court.

2. Nature of the Action
2.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint to modify the existing custody order dated May 14, 2019, which currently provides for equal physical custody (alternating weeks) of the parties’ child, Samantha.
2.2 Plaintiff seeks modification of physical custody and parenting time due to a material change in circumstances affecting the child's safety and welfare.

3. Background and Prior Order
3.1 On May 14, 2019, the Probate and Family Court entered a custody order awarding the parties joint legal custody and equal physical custody on a one-week-on/one-week-off schedule (the "2019 Order"), which has been in effect since that date.
3.2 The arrangement worked for several years while both parents lived nearby and were able to provide stable and safe routines for Samantha.

4. Material Change of Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the 2019 Order, Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition.
4.2 As a consequence of that condition, Defendant has suffered multiple falls in his home.
4.3 Defendant’s treating physician has advised that Defendant should not be alone with Samantha in circumstances involving stairs or where quick physical response may be required.
4.4 Despite these medical restrictions, Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the identical 50/50 alternating-week schedule.
4.5 Defendant has on multiple occasions relied on Samantha, age 12, to assist him with physically demanding or safety-sensitive tasks, including helping him transfer from his wheelchair to bed and retrieving items for him that require climbing or navigating stairs.
4.6 Plaintiff has become increasingly concerned that Samantha is being placed in an inappropriate caregiving role and is exposed to safety risks during Defendant’s periods of physical custody.
4.7 The Defendant’s medical prognosis is progressive; thus, the condition is ongoing and is likely to continue to affect Defendant's capacity to provide unsupervised care in certain contexts.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the child. The best-interest standard considers, inter alia, the child's safety, health, and welfare and the ability of each parent to provide a stable environment.
5.2 Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant’s progressive neurological disease, the physician’s restrictions, the history of falls, and Defendant’s reliance on the child to assist him with physical tasks constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the 2019 Order.

6. Facts Supporting Best Interests and Requested Relief
6.1 Samantha is twelve (12) years old, in middle school, and benefits from stable routines, consistent supervision, and protection from being placed in the role of caregiver to an adult.
6.2 The Defendant’s condition compromises his ability to safely care for Samantha without supervision in certain settings (e.g., stairs, transfers, bathing or dressing assistance, emergency response).
6.3 The continuing application of the equal alternating-week schedule places Samantha at unnecessary risk and pressures her to act as an aide to Defendant, contrary to the child’s developmental needs and safety.
6.4 Plaintiff is able and willing to provide primary physical care and a stable home environment appropriate to Samantha’s needs.
6.5 Plaintiff proposes a parenting plan that gives primary physical custody to Plaintiff, with regular, safe, and structured parenting time for Defendant adjusted to times and settings consistent with Defendant’s health and the child’s safety (e.g., day visits, visits at Defendant’s residence only when a responsible adult is present or for supervised/assisted visits, or visits at neutral locations when appropriate). Plaintiff also requests that the Court require Defendant to obtain and present periodic medical clearance regarding his capacity to parent safely and that the Court order a custody evaluation and/or appointment of a guardian ad litem or parenting coordinator if the Court deems such evaluation helpful to resolve issues related to the proposed modification.

7. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:
7.1 Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 14, 2019 custody order.
7.2 Modify the 2019 Order to award primary physical custody of Samantha to Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, subject to reasonable and safe parenting time for Defendant, Michael Collins, structured as follows (or as otherwise ordered by the Court):
   a. Weekday and overnight schedule to be primarily with Plaintiff, with reasonable day, evening, or weekend parenting time for Defendant scheduled to avoid situations requiring rapid physical response or independent transfers (e.g., visits in Plaintiff’s home, neutral locations, or Defendant’s home only when a qualified adult is present);
   b. Defendant’s parenting time to be supervised or assisted if and to the extent the Court deems necessary for the child’s safety, or until Defendant produces medical documentation from his treating neurologist or primary care physician clearing him for unsupervised parenting in all settings;
   c. A requirement that Defendant provide medical releases and periodic medical updates to the Court as to his condition and capabilities with respect to child care.
7.3 Order that the Defendant refrain from relying on Samantha to perform adult caregiving tasks, including but not limited to transferring him between wheelchair and bed, providing physical assistance that could injure the child, or otherwise acting as a primary caregiver to an adult.
7.4 Order that a custody evaluation by a qualified mental health professional and/or appointment of a guardian ad litem be conducted to assist the Court in assessing parenting capacity, child safety, and the appropriate parenting plan.
7.5 Issue temporary emergency relief modifying the parties’ physical custody arrangement pending final hearing to ensure Samantha’s immediate safety (including temporary primary physical custody to Plaintiff and structured supervised or modified parenting time for Defendant).
7.6 Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper, including costs of suit, and any additional orders the Court finds necessary to protect the welfare of the child.

8. Verification
I, Jessica Collins, verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Representative)
Note: The following statutes and authorities are cited as commonly relied-upon Massachusetts statutes, rules, and caselaw principles concerning jurisdiction, modification, and the best interests standard. Plaintiff requests the Court consider these authorities as applicable. Counsel or the Court may cite additional controlling authorities.

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (matters of divorce, custody and related family matters)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A (child abuse/neglect reporting duties)

Selected Principles from Massachusetts Case Law (Representative)
Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts law recognizing (1) the Court’s authority to modify custody upon a showing of a material change in circumstances; (2) the best-interests-of-the-child standard; and (3) the Court’s ability to order evaluations, supervised parenting time, and other protective measures. Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court consider applicable Massachusetts appellate authority addressing these principles, including Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing custody modification, best-interests factors, and interim relief. Plaintiff will rely on such controlling precedent at hearing.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

A. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the 2019 Order;
B. Modify physical custody to award primary physical custody to Plaintiff, with parenting time to Defendant structured for the child’s safety;
C. Order temporary relief pending final hearing as set forth above;
