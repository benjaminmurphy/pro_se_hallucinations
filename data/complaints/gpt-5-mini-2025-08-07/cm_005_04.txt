__________________________________________)

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   - Plaintiff: Sara Mitchell, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Phone: (617) 555-0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.
   - Defendant: Kyle Thompson, residence unknown to Plaintiff for purposes of this filing (subject to court process).
   - The parties are the parents of the following minor children:
       a. Emma Thompson, born 2015 (10 years old);
       b. Liam Thompson, born 2017 (8 years old).
   - This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to the provisions of the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court and the applicable statutes governing custody and parental rights.

2. Existing Order
   - On March 15, 2022, this Court entered an order concerning custody and parenting time (the “Existing Order”) providing for joint legal custody, with the children primarily residing with Plaintiff and visiting Defendant on an alternating-weekend schedule. The Existing Order further provides that the parties shall support the children’s relationship with each parent and shall not disparage each other in the presence of the children.

3. Nature of the Action
   - This is a Complaint for Modification of the Existing Order of custody and parenting time. Plaintiff seeks modification of the physical custody arrangement to establish that the children shall continue to primarily reside with Plaintiff (affirming primary residential custody) with clarified and enforceable rules regarding decisions about extracurricular activities and scheduling, and to obtain other relief necessary to protect the children’s best interests. Plaintiff seeks a finding that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order that warrants modification of the custody and parenting-time provisions.

4. Statement of Facts (Allegations)
   A. Parenting arrangement and recent conduct
      1. Since entry of the Existing Order, Plaintiff has provided the primary residence for Emma and Liam and has exercised primary caregiving responsibilities.
      2. Over the past year, Defendant has unilaterally signed Emma and Liam up for extracurricular activities that occur during Plaintiff’s scheduled weekends and times when the children would be with Plaintiff, without discussing those activities or schedule conflicts with Plaintiff in advance.
      3. When the children are with Plaintiff and cannot attend those activities, Defendant has told the children that Plaintiff is “selfish” and that Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” for allegedly not allowing the children to attend — statements Defendant makes directly to the children and, at times, within the children’s hearing.
      4. The children have relayed these comments to Plaintiff and have expressed distress about the criticism and the scheduling conflicts.
      5. One child, Emma, has developed recurring stomach aches on transition days (i.e., days she moves between parents’ homes), which Plaintiff reasonably believes are stress-related and connected to the current parental conflict and Defendant’s disparaging conduct.
      6. Defendant’s repeated unilateral scheduling decisions and disparaging remarks, and the emotional reaction of the children, have increased parental conflict and have impaired the stability and emotional well‑being of the children.
   B. Attempts to resolve the issues
      7. Plaintiff has asked Defendant to consult and coordinate about extracurricular commitments that conflict with scheduled parenting time, and to refrain from disparaging Plaintiff in the children’s presence, in accordance with the Existing Order. Defendant has continued the behavior despite these requests.
   C. Material change in circumstances
      8. Since entry of the Existing Order on March 15, 2022, circumstances have materially changed: Defendant’s pattern of unilateral scheduling of extracurricular activities during Plaintiff’s parenting time, active disparagement of Plaintiff to the children, and the children’s demonstrable emotional distress (including physical symptoms) constitute a substantial change in circumstances materially affecting the children’s welfare and the practical functioning of the custody arrangement.
      9. These circumstances materially impair the children’s emotional stability and the ability of the parties to co-parent effectively under the Existing Order.

5. Legal Standard
   - Modification of custody or parenting-time orders is appropriate when there has been a material change in circumstances since the prior order and modification is in the best interests of the children. See applicable Massachusetts law and caselaw addressing custody modifications and the best-interests standard (collectively cited below), including authorities recognizing that interference with parenting time, parental disparagement, and actions that harm a child’s emotional health can establish a material change justifying modification and/or more detailed orders regarding decisionmaking and communication.
   - Plaintiff invokes the Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting-time pursuant to Massachusetts statutes and principles established in Massachusetts caselaw interpreting the “best interests of the child” standard, parental rights, and modification jurisprudence.

6. Claims for Relief (Causes of Action)
   COUNT I — MODIFICATION OF PHYSICAL CUSTODY BASED ON MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
   10. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 9 as if fully set forth herein.
   11. The foregoing facts constitute a material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order, materially affecting the health, safety, and welfare of the children.
   12. Modification of physical custody is necessary to protect the children’s best interests and to promote stability and consistent caregiving. Plaintiff therefore seeks an order establishing that the children shall primarily reside with Plaintiff, with parenting time to Defendant as set forth below (or as the Court deems appropriate).
   COUNT II — CLARIFICATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF DECISIONMAKING AND SCHEDULING AUTHORITY
   13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.
   14. In order to prevent further unilateral actions that interfere with parenting time and harm the children’s emotional well-being, Plaintiff seeks a clarified order governing extracurricular activities and scheduling decisions, requiring:
       a. that each parent provide advance written notice of any extracurricular commitments reasonably likely to conflict with the other parent’s scheduled time;
       b. that activities falling during the other parent’s scheduled time require written agreement (email or text is acceptable) at least 14 days in advance, except in emergencies or where the child has historically been permitted to attend the activity during that parent’s time;
       c. a prescribed mechanism for resolving disputes about scheduling and extracurriculars, including prompt conferencing and, if necessary, expedited Court intervention or neutral third-party resolution (e.g., parenting coordinator or family mediation).
   COUNT III — PROHIBITION OF DISPARAGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COURT ORDER
   15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.
   16. Plaintiff seeks a specific order prohibiting the Defendant from making disparaging, denigrating, or alienating statements about Plaintiff in the presence of the children, and requiring parental conduct consistent with the Existing Order’s requirement to support the children’s relationship with each parent.
   17. Plaintiff further requests that the Court order Defendant to attend parenting counseling or a parental education program as the Court deems appropriate, and to order child counseling for children as needed, to mitigate harm from prior disparaging conduct and to restore healthy co-parenting.

7. Request for Temporary Relief
   18. Plaintiff requests that the Court consider issuing temporary orders pending final hearing: (a) affirming the children’s primary residence with Plaintiff and (b) ordering Defendant to refrain from disparaging remarks to or about Plaintiff in the children’s presence, and (c) requiring both parties to provide 14 days’ notice of new extracurricular activities that fall on the other parent’s parenting time.
   19. Plaintiff believes that urgent temporary relief is warranted to prevent further emotional harm to the children and to reduce ongoing interference with parenting time.

8. Best Interests Factors
   20. In determining custody and parenting-time modifications, Plaintiff asks the Court to consider all statutory and case-established factors bearing on the children’s best interests, including but not limited to the children’s physical safety and emotional needs, continuity and stability of care, each parent’s ability to foster the children’s relationship with the other parent, the effect of parental conduct on the children’s well-being, and any evidence of alienation or disparagement. Plaintiff submits that the facts herein weigh in favor of the requested modification and the additional provisions proposed.

9. Legal Authorities (Representative Statutes and Caselaw)
   - Statutes (Massachusetts):
       1. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (Divorce and general family law provisions concerning custody orders and modification authority).
       2. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209 (par. — statutes addressing parental rights and obligations).
       3. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (Protection of children and welfare statutes relating to reports and child welfare).
       4. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 (relevant procedural and evidentiary provisions as applicable to Probate and Family Court practice).
       5. Mass. General Laws and rules governing the Probate and Family Court (including domestic-relations procedure and contempt remedies).
   - Selected Controlling and Persuasive Authorities (examples of relevant caselaw and principles):
       6. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing fundamental parental rights and the need to balance parental autonomy with children’s best interests).
       7. Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429 (1984) (addressing the best-interests standard and impermissible considerations).
       8. Massachusetts decisions and appellate authority addressing custody modification and best-interests analysis; courts have recognized that a material change in circumstances — including parental interference with parenting time, disparagement, and demonstrated harm to the child’s emotional or physical health — can warrant modification and specific remedial orders (see, e.g., leading Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court rulings construing custody modification standards and remedies).
       9. Authorities addressing parental alienation, interference with parenting time, and the Court’s power to fashion orders to protect the child’s best interests and the free exercise of visitation rights.
       10. Massachusetts case law recognizing the availability of temporary relief, contempt, and enforcement remedies where court orders are violated or where immediate intervention is required to protect the child’s welfare.
   - Plaintiff will rely on the full text of the foregoing statutes and cases and will cite additional controlling Massachusetts case law at hearing and in brief as necessary. (Plaintiff requests leave to supplement the record with specific citations to relevant Massachusetts appellate decisions identified during preparation for hearing.)

10. Relief Requested (Prayer for Relief)
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to enter an order providing the following relief:
   A. A finding that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order of March 15, 2022, warranting modification of custody and parenting-time arrangements;

   C. An express, enforceable order governing extracurricular activities and scheduling, including:
       1. Advance written notice requirement (e.g., email/text) to the other parent of extracurricular activities that may conflict with the other parent’s scheduled time;
       2. Activities falling during the other parent’s scheduled time require written consent of that parent at least 14 days in advance, absent emergency circumstances or pre-existing exceptions;
       3. A mechanism for prompt resolution of scheduling disputes (e.g., expedited hearing, parenting coordinator, or mediation).
   D. An express, enforceable order prohibiting either parent from making disparaging or denigrating comments about the other parent in the presence of the children and requiring both parents to support the children’s relationship with the other parent consistent with the Existing Order.
   E. An order requiring Defendant to attend a parental-education or parenting-counseling program and, if the Court deems appropriate, ordering counseling or therapeutic services for the children with qualified professionals (at the parties’ joint or proportionate expense as the Court orders).
   F. Temporary emergency orders as the Court deems appropriate pending final hearing (including immediate prohibition on disparagement and a temporary affirmation of the children’s primary residence with Plaintiff).
   G. Any other relief the Court finds necessary to protect the children’s best interests, including costs, fees, and such further relief as justice requires.

11. Request for Hearing; Request for Relief from Local Rules
