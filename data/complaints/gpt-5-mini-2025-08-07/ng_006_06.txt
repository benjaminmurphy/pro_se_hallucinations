COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jordan Thompson, and for his Complaint against Defendant Mark Williams alleges as follows.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Williams is an adult individual who at all times relevant to this action resided and/or conducted activities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. This action arises out of a motor-vehicle-related personal injury that occurred in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, and this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.

FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS

5. On August 12, 2023, at approximately [time not stated], Plaintiff was lawfully riding a bicycle to work in a marked bicycle lane on 17th Street in Boston, Massachusetts (zip 02116), proceeding in the direction of travel, obeying all traffic laws, and wearing a helmet.

6. At or about the same time and place, Defendant had stopped and parked a motor vehicle in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bicycle lane.

7. As Plaintiff was lawfully passing the parked vehicle within the bike lane, Defendant—without looking and without checking his mirrors—suddenly opened the driver’s side door into the bicycle lane. The door was opened wide and across the path of the bicyclist.

8. Plaintiff had no realistic opportunity to stop, slow, or swerve to avoid the open door; Plaintiff struck the edge of the open door, was thrown from his bicycle, and struck the pavement.

9. At the scene Defendant told Plaintiff he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone. Defendant’s later insurance claim asserted a different account (that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic”), which is not true.

10. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct as described above, Plaintiff sustained injuries including road rash to both arms and legs and a chipped front tooth. Plaintiff’s bicycle was damaged (the frame bent) and required replacement.

11. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses and related out-of-pocket costs of approximately $1,500. Plaintiff lost wages in the approximate amount of $800. Plaintiff also incurred property damage and replacement costs for his bicycle and incurred additional incidental and consequential damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

12. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable for negligence if the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, breaches that duty, and the breach is the proximate cause of damages to the plaintiff. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282; Mass. caselaw recognizing the same elements of negligence (duty, breach, causation, damages).

14. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to other users of the roadway, including bicyclists lawfully using the bicycle lane. That duty included exercising reasonable care before opening a vehicle door adjacent to moving traffic or a bicycle lane, and refraining from opening a door when it is unsafe to do so.

15. Defendant breached his duty by opening his vehicle door suddenly and without looking and without ensuring it was safe to do so, thereby placing an open door into the path of oncoming traffic and into the bicycle lane where Plaintiff was lawfully riding.

16. Defendant’s breach—opening his vehicle door into the bicycle lane without regard for oncoming bicyclists, and doing so while distracted by his phone—was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s collision with the door, Plaintiff’s fall, and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries including road rash and a chipped tooth, incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,500, suffered lost wages of approximately $800, sustained damage to his bicycle (necessitating replacement), and suffered other general and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages, including but not limited to: past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage (including the cost to repair or replace Plaintiff’s bicycle), and all other economic and non-economic damages permitted by law, in an amount in excess of $2,300 and to be further proven at trial (including amounts to be proven for the bicycle and other non-specified losses);

B. Awarding interest, costs, and disbursements as allowed by law;

C. Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
