It does not discuss premises liability, invitees, or the duty of a possessor of land. Therefore, it does not support the proposition that Lynch v.

It does not involve a store owner, transitory hazards, or constructive notice on premises, nor does it analyze foreseeability in the premises-liability sense.

Klug, a landlord-tenant/summary process case concerning G.L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A, amendment of counterclaims, and tenant status, not notice of a dangerous condition or time-on-floor issues in premises liability. Because the case excerpted does not address notice of dangerous conditions or the time factor relevant to slip-and-fall or similar claims, it cannot support the stated proposition about Kershaw v.

To effectuate the intent that summary process be expeditious and to deter dilatory manipulation of summary process procedure, we are of opinion that parties generally should be limited, upon appeal to the Superior Court under G.L.c. 239, \u00a7 5, to the defenses and counterclaims asserted in the District Court or Housing Court.\""
