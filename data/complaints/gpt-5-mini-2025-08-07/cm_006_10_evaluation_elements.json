      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Paragraph 2.2 identifies an Existing Order entered May 15, 2021 awarding Plaintiff primary physical custody and granting Defendant alternate weekends and one midweek visit, which sufficiently pleads a prior custody/parenting-time judgment."

      "satisfied": true,

    "best_interests_of_child": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Paragraphs 5.1\u20135.4 tie the alleged post-judgment facts to the statutory best-interests standard and expressly allege that restricting or supervising Defendant\u2019s parenting time is necessary to protect the children\u2019s physical safety and emotional wellbeing; the complaint therefore alleges that the requested modification is in the children\u2019s best interests."
