Superior Court is a California Supreme Court case that adopts an implied warranty of habitability under California law; it only mentions Massachusetts (Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway and Ingalls v. Hobbs) as persuasive authority from another jurisdiction. It does not analyze or establish Massachusetts doctrine, so it cannot be cited as authority for what Massachusetts courts have \u201clong treated\u201d these covenants to mean.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe Supreme Court of Wisconsin was the first to adopt this approach in 1961, and since 1969 the Supreme Courts of Hawaii, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Illinois, Iowa, and Massachusetts and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have followed this lead. [fn. 12] \u2026 In the seminal case of Ingalls v. Hobbs (1892) 156 Mass. 348, 350 [31 N.E. 286]) the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained why the traditional no warranty of habitability rule did not apply to such rentals\u2026 Our decision today may be seen as a logical development of the common law principles embodied in the Ingalls decision.\u201d}"

St. Peter is a Vermont Supreme Court case that adopts and explains the implied warranty of habitability under Vermont law; it does not interpret Massachusetts law or discuss Massachusetts courts\u2019 treatment of these doctrines. Although Hilder favorably quotes Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, that reference is persuasive authority and does not itself establish what Massachusetts courts have \u2018long\u2019 done, so this case does not support the proposition as stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe modern view favors a new approach which recognizes that a lease is essentially a contract between the landlord and the tenant wherein the landlord promises to deliver and maintain the demised premises in habitable condition and the tenant promises to pay rent for such habitable premises. These promises constitute interdependent and mutual considerations. Thus, the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent is predicated on the landlord\u2019s obligation to deliver and maintain the premises in habitable condition. Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 198, 293 N.E.2d 831, 842 (1973).\u201d"
