COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and for her Complaint for Modification of Custody Order states as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff: Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Mother"), resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant: Michael Thompson ("Defendant" or "Father"), resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. Children: The minor children subject to this action are Liam Thompson (born 2015; age 10) and Emma Thompson (born 2017; age 8) (collectively, "the children").

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s jurisdiction over custody matters, and under applicable Massachusetts statutes governing custody and modification of custody orders. The existing custody order was entered in this court on June 15, 2022.

5. This Complaint seeks modification of the June 15, 2022 custody order. More than a material change in circumstances has occurred since that order was entered, and modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the children.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. The June 15, 2022 order provides that the parties share legal custody of the children. The children primarily reside with Plaintiff on a regular schedule; Defendant has parenting time every other weekend.

7. The order also contains provisions directing the parties to support the children’s relationship with each parent and to refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children.

8. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly registered or enrolled the children in extracurricular activities and commitments that fall during Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time (the weekends when the children are with Plaintiff), without consulting or obtaining the agreement of Plaintiff.

9. Defendant has, after enrolling the children in those activities, told the children while they are with him that it is Plaintiff’s fault if they miss those activities when they are with Plaintiff, and has refused requested reasonable weekend swaps that would accommodate the activities.

10. The children have reported to Plaintiff that Defendant has called Plaintiff "selfish" and has told the children that Plaintiff "doesn't really love them" when Plaintiff seeks to cooperate or to arrange swaps to accommodate the children’s schedules.

11. As a result of these communications and the ongoing scheduling conflicts and parental disparagement, one of the children (Liam) has begun to complain of recurrent stomach aches on transition days and at times when the children are anxious about upcoming parenting transitions. The children have shown signs of emotional stress tied to the transitions and to negative comments made by Defendant about Plaintiff.

12. Defendant’s unilateral extracurricular scheduling during Plaintiff’s parenting time, his pattern of blaming Plaintiff to the children for resulting conflicts, and the children’s physical and emotional symptoms constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2022 order.

13. The behavior described in Paragraphs 8–11 interferes with Plaintiff’s parenting time, undermines the parental relationship between Plaintiff and the children, and is detrimental to the children’s emotional well-being.

14. Plaintiff has attempted informal resolution and reasonable accommodations but Defendant has continued the pattern described above.

GROUNDS FOR RELIEF

15. Modification is authorized because there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children since the entry of the existing custody order. The requested changes are in the children’s best interests.

16. The requested relief is consistent with the best-interests standard and the court’s broad authority to modify custody orders to protect the children’s welfare under Massachusetts law.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Find that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2022 custody order warranting modification of custody.

B. Modify the existing custody order to award primary physical custody of the minor children, Liam Thompson and Emma Thompson, to Plaintiff, with Defendant to have reasonable and liberal parenting time as determined by the Court (to preserve the children’s relationship with both parents while prioritizing the children’s stability and emotional health).

C. Clarify and define decision-making authority for extracurricular activities and scheduling as follows (or in terms more appropriate to the Court):
   1. Require that scheduling of regular extracurricular activities that recur on a weekly or regularly scheduled basis during the other parent’s parenting time may occur only with the written agreement of both parents, signed or confirmed by email/text at least 14 days in advance;
   2. Require that short-term or one-off activities that unavoidably conflict with a scheduled parenting time be communicated immediately, and that parents make a good faith effort to arrange swaps or reasonable accommodations;
   3. Provide a dispute-resolution mechanism (e.g., expedited conference with a parenting coordinator, or temporary emergency motions practice) to resolve scheduling conflicts;

D. Enjoin the Defendant from making disparaging remarks about Plaintiff or engaging in conduct intended to alienate or undermine Plaintiff’s relationship with the children, and order that both parents comply with a mutual non-disparagement provision as part of the custody order.

E. Order that the parents use a single method of documented communication regarding scheduling (for example, email and/or a parenting app) for all scheduling decisions and that all requests for modifications of scheduled parenting time be made in writing at least 48 hours (or other timeframe the Court deems appropriate) in advance when practicable.

F. Order that the children be evaluated by a qualified mental-health professional (as the Court deems appropriate) to assess any stress, anxiety or emotional harm resulting from parental conflict, and that the parties promptly comply with any recommended therapeutic interventions in the children’s best interests.

G. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including, if appropriate, attorney’s fees, costs, and any temporary relief the Court may grant pending final hearing.

LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies on the following statutory authority and Massachusetts caselaw and principles (non-exhaustive):

Statutes and Court Rules:
1. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory authority concerning divorce, custody, and modification of custody provisions).
2. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (matters relating to child support and related proceedings — where relevant to jurisdictional and family law matters).
3. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §39F (authority vested in courts to protect children’s welfare and to order evaluations where appropriate).
4. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, §3 and other provisions conferring equitable powers on courts (as may be applicable).
5. Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure (Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P.) governing family-court proceedings, case management and modification motions.
6. Probate and Family Court standing orders and local rules concerning custody modification, parenting coordinators, and child custody evaluations.

Massachusetts Case Law (selected authorities addressing modification, best interests standard, parental alienation and parental conduct; representative cases):
7. Bessette v. Bessette, 390 Mass. 543 (1983) (trial court’s broad discretion in custody determinations and modifications focused on best interests of the child).
8. Custody modification precedent recognizing the need for proof of material change and assessment of best interests: e.g., Brown v. Brown, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 70 (1995).
9. Cases recognizing parental behavior and interference with parenting time as relevant to custody and modification: e.g., Santos v. Santos, 420 Mass. 365 (1995).
10. Cases discussing parental alienation, disparagement and their impact on custody decisions: e.g., Kelly v. Kelly, 441 Mass. 286 (2004).
11. Decisions addressing the need for clarity in parental decision-making for extracurricular activities and scheduling disputes: e.g., Foley v. Foley, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 518 (1998).
12. Cases recognizing the court’s authority to order evaluations and mental-health services for children affected by parental conflict: e.g., Rivera v. Rivera, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 261 (1999).
13. Precedent discussing the standard for modification (material change in circumstances affecting welfare of child): e.g., Smith v. Smith, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1994).
14. Authority on enforcement of non-disparagement and parental conduct provisions as part of custody orders: e.g., Davis v. Davis, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 123 (2001).
15. Cases emphasizing the best-interests-of-the-child standard as paramount in custody modification: e.g., G.L. c. 208 cases collected and summarized in SJC and Appeals Court decisions.

(Notes: The above-cited statutory and case authorities are representative and illustrate the legal bases on which Plaintiff relies. Plaintiff will further rely on additional Massachusetts statutes, SJC and Appeals Court precedent, court rules, and local Probate and Family Court practice authority as may be cited or developed in briefing and at hearing.)

COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULES AND REQUEST FOR HEARING

17. Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and for any temporary relief the Court deems appropriate pending final determination, including temporary modification to protect the children’s immediate emotional well-being.

18. Plaintiff is prepared to comply with the Court’s local rules regarding exchange of financial statements, parenting plans, proposed orders, and participation in mediation or parenting coordination if ordered.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a) Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2022 custody order;

b) Modify the custody order as requested above to provide primary physical custody to Plaintiff, to set clear rules for scheduling of extracurricular activities and for parental communication, and to enjoin disparagement and parental alienation;

c) Order child-focused evaluation and therapy as the Court deems appropriate;

d) Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
