Sophia Reynolds
Plaintiff

v.

Michael Reynolds
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
1.1 Plaintiff: Sophia Reynolds ("Plaintiff"), a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, telephone (617) 555-0123, email psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: Michael Reynolds ("Defendant"), parent of the minor child identified below (last known address: [to be provided for service]).
1.3 Minor child: Ethan Reynolds, age 8 (born 2017). (Hereafter, "the Child".)

2. Court and Jurisdiction
2.1 This Court has continuing jurisdiction under Massachusetts law over custody of the minor child pursuant to the existing custody order entered in this Court on May 15, 2018 (the "Prior Order").
2.2 Venue in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court is proper because the Prior Order was entered in this Court and the Child resides in this county.

3. Procedural Background
3.1 On May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order awarding primary physical custody of the Child to Plaintiff and awarding Defendant short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit each week, with no overnights. The no-overnight limitation reflected circumstances at that time, including Defendant's lack of a separate residence and lack of appropriate sleeping accommodations for the Child.
3.2 The Prior Order remains in effect and is the order sought to be modified.

4. Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the Prior Order in 2018, circumstances material to the custody arrangement have changed.
4.2 Change in housing and sleeping accommodations: Defendant now occupies his own apartment and has a separate bedroom available for the Child. The living arrangements that previously justified no overnights no longer exist.
4.3 Child’s age and developmental needs: The Child is now eight years old and in full-time elementary school. His needs for stable study routines, consistent sleep schedules, and age-appropriate parenting time have evolved since the original order when he was three.
4.4 Child’s expressed preference: The Child has repeatedly expressed a desire to have overnight stays/sleepovers with his father. The Child’s consistent expression of a mature age-appropriate preference is a relevant consideration for custody and parenting time decisions.
4.5 Current schedule causes practical difficulties: Under the current short-visit arrangement the Child is transported back and forth for multiple short visits, including on school nights. These frequent transfers disrupt homework, bedtime routines, and the Child’s sleep and overall adjustment to school life. The current routing is exhausting for the Child and for both parents.
4.6 Parties’ agreement that change is appropriate: Plaintiff and Defendant both agree that the parenting schedule should be adjusted to reflect the Child’s age, the Child’s need for more substantial continuous time with each parent, and Defendant’s changed living circumstances.
4.7 These changes are material, non-speculative, and substantial and affect the Child’s best interests. They were not anticipated at the time the Prior Order was entered.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Under Massachusetts law, a court may modify a child custody or visitation order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order that affects the child’s best interests and warrants revision of the order. The child’s best interest is the paramount concern in any modification proceeding.
5.2 The Plaintiff alleges that the foregoing facts establish a material change in circumstances and that modification is in the Child’s best interests.

6. Request for Relief — Proposed Modification
6.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the Prior Order to reflect the changed circumstances described above and to enter an updated parenting plan that:
   a. Permits Defendant to have regular overnight parenting time (overnights/sleepovers) with the Child, beginning with implementation of a reasonable schedule that gives the Child continuous blocks of time with Defendant (for example, alternating weekends with an overnight from Friday evening through Sunday evening, or such other schedule ordered by the Court), and
   b. Eliminates or minimizes short school-night exchanges that interfere with the Child’s homework and bedtime routines by providing longer, consolidated parenting time periods (including weekend and other non-school-time overnights) to reduce frequent shuttling, and
   c. Allows for reasonable expansion of Defendant’s parenting time consistent with the Child’s age, school schedule, and best interests including additional holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time as appropriate, and
   d. Provides for any reasonable exchange, communication, and transition protocols (location and timing of exchanges, notification procedures, and contact during the Child’s school days) necessary to implement the revised parenting schedule, and
   e. Imposes whatever oversight, steps, or temporary conditions the Court deems necessary to ensure the Child’s safety and welfare during an initial period of overnight parenting time (if any are deemed necessary by the Court), such as gradual introduction to overnight stays, reasonable health and safety disclosures, and agreement to a parenting coordinator or brief monitoring period if the Court finds it appropriate.

6.2 Plaintiff further requests that the Court:
   a. Appoint a parenting coordinator or order mediation if appropriate;
   b. Enter temporary orders necessary to effectuate restructuring of parenting time pending final hearing;
   c. Schedule an early hearing date to resolve this modification petition; and
   d. Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

7. Basis in Law (Selected Authorities)
Plaintiff relies on the governing statutory scheme and case law that govern custody modification and best interests determinations in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to:
Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions concerning custody and support and the authority of the Probate and Family Court regarding family matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — jurisdictional rules for custody matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (provisions regarding the care and protection of children where relevant).
- Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure and Rules of the Probate and Family Court.

Selected Massachusetts and other authorities concerning modification and best interests (illustrative and relied upon):
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing parental rights and that parental decisionmaking is to be accorded weight in custody/visitation matters).
- Massachusetts cases recognizing material change/best interest standards and ongoing jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody/visitation orders (examples of controlling principles from Massachusetts caselaw and appellate decisions):
   - cases holding that modification requires a material change in circumstances since the prior order and that the child's best interests control;
   - cases recognizing that parental housing changes, the child’s age and development, the child's adjustment to school, and the child's stated preferences are relevant factors in modification determinations;
- The parties rely on and will cite relevant Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court precedents at hearing to support the foregoing principles (including precedents addressing material change, evaluation of best interests factors, implementation of overnight parenting time, and the Court’s discretion to fashion parenting plans and interim orders).

(At hearing, Plaintiff will cite and rely on specific Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court precedents and statutory provisions directly controlling the Court’s modification authority and the best-interests analysis. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court consider the well-established body of Massachusetts authority applying the material-change standard and the best-interests factors to determine that the requested modification is appropriate here.)

8. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:
8.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order;
8.2 Modify the Prior Order to permit appropriate overnight parenting time for Defendant and to restructure parenting time to reduce school-night shuttling and promote the Child’s stable routines and best interests, as described in Paragraph 6 above (or in such other manner as the Court deems just and proper);
8.3 Enter such interim/temporary orders as necessary to implement a schedule pending final hearing;
8.4 Order mediation and/or appoint a parenting coordinator if the Court deems such services appropriate to facilitate a parenting plan that serves the Child's best interests;
8.5 Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.

9. Verification
I, Sophia Reynolds, declare under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing factual allegations are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Dated: December 1, 2025
Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Sophia Reynolds
