COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NATURE OF ACTION
1. This is an action by a residential tenant, Plaintiff Emily Carter, pursuant to Massachusetts common law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases and for related equitable relief and damages. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the amount of $1,200, costs, and injunctive and declaratory relief requiring the abatement of the continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her leased premises.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
2. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual who resides at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02144. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1433@gmail.com.

3. Defendant Robert Thompson is the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA, and the landlord of Plaintiff’s apartment. Defendant may be served at his usual place of business or residence in Massachusetts.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the real property and the events giving rise to this action are located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Somerville District Court.

5. Venue in Somerville District Court is proper because the leased premises are located in Somerville and the acts complained of occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6. Plaintiff leases Apartment 2, on the second floor of a triple-decker located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA, pursuant to a written lease that commenced on January 1, 2022. The written lease expressly provides that the tenant is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the leased premises.

7. Plaintiff pays rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,800 per month.

8. Beginning approximately six months ago (spring/summer 2025), new tenants moved into the apartment directly above Plaintiff’s apartment. Since their move-in, those tenants have engaged in a persistent pattern of loud noise, including frequent and intense stomping, loud music late at night, and the repeated sound of furniture being moved at or around midnight.

9. The noise has been continuous and recurrent, occurring at all hours and most intensely at night. As a result of the noise, Plaintiff has been averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night.

10. Plaintiff has attempted to resolve the problem informally and in good faith. Plaintiff spoke directly to the upstairs tenants and asked them to moderate their noise levels. The upstairs tenants complied for about one week, but then resumed the disruptive conduct.

11. Plaintiff notified Defendant, the landlord, of the continuing excessive noise and requested that Defendant take steps to remedy the situation on approximately five or six separate occasions over the past six months.

12. On at least one occasion Defendant told the upstairs tenants about the complaint but afterward told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.” Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable steps to abate or prevent the ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the premises.

13. As a proximate result of Defendant’s failure to prevent or abate the excessive noise, Plaintiff has suffered substantial and continuing interference with use and enjoyment of her apartment, sleep deprivation, and resulting harms including: (a) loss of sleep; (b) diminution of quality of life in the leased premises; (c) disciplinary action at work (a written warning for falling asleep on the job); and (d) medical expenses related to treatment for sleep problems, including $40 per month for prescription sleep medication.

14. Plaintiff has expended out-of-pocket amounts in an attempt to mitigate the harm (earplugs, white-noise machine, rearrangement of the bedroom), none of which have reasonably abated the disturbance.

15. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease and actionable under Massachusetts law.

LAW AND AUTHORITIES
16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in residential leases in Massachusetts and imposes an obligation on landlords not to substantially interfere with a tenant’s beneficial and peaceful enjoyment of the leased premises. See, e.g., Massachusetts case law recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment; the general landlord-tenant statutory framework in Massachusetts (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186) and other authorities governing landlord duties and tenant remedies are applicable. (Authorities relevant to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations include, by way of example and not limitation: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process) and related provisions; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (for some contexts of landlord conduct); the State Sanitary Code and 105 CMR 410.000 (habitable housing standards); and Massachusetts caselaw addressing landlord obligations and the covenant of quiet enjoyment.)

17. Plaintiff relies on and invokes applicable Massachusetts common law principles regarding landlord liability for interference with quiet enjoyment, and on statutes and regulations that identify and define landlord obligations with respect to condition and use of residential premises, including the State Sanitary Code, and on all relevant Massachusetts authority that recognizes remedies for tenants injured by substantial and continuing interference. Plaintiff asserts these authorities for the proposition that a landlord who is aware of and fails to abate a substantial, unreasonable, and ongoing interference with a tenant’s peaceful use of the premises breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may be liable for resulting damages and equitable relief.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)
18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.

19. Plaintiff and Defendant are parties to a valid lease under which Plaintiff is entitled to quiet enjoyment of Apartment 2 at 123 Elm Street.

20. Defendant, as landlord, had actual knowledge of the persistent and unreasonable noise emanating from the unit directly above Plaintiff and of Plaintiff’s repeated complaints.

21. Defendant had the ability and duty under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and the lease to take reasonable steps to abate the nuisance or otherwise prevent a continuing and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, including, for example, repeated warnings, enforcement of lease provisions, mediation with the upstairs tenants, tenant reassignment, abatement of rent, or pursuing appropriate legal remedies against the upstairs tenants when they continued the disruptive conduct.

22. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable and effective action after having been put on notice of the continuing noise constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease.

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to physical and mental suffering, loss of sleep, diminution of the use and enjoyment of her apartment, a written work warning, increased medical expenses (including $40 per month for prescribed sleep medication), the cost of attempted mitigations (earplugs, white-noise machine), and other consequential damages.

24. Plaintiff’s damages to date reasonably total $1,200 (compensatory damages for diminished use, inconvenience, and out-of-pocket expenses), exclusive of costs, interest, and fees, and Plaintiff reserves the right to prove additional damages, including future medical and other consequential damages caused by the continuing disturbance.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,200, together with pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

B. Order injunctive and declaratory relief requiring Defendant to take reasonable, effective steps to abate the continuing unreasonable noise and otherwise to secure Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, including but not limited to requiring Defendant to enforce the lease against the upstairs tenants, to provide periodic follow-up to ensure compliance, and/or to relocate one or more tenants or offer reasonable accommodation to abate the nuisance if necessary;

C. Award Plaintiff costs and disbursements of this action and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable;

D. Grant any other relief the Court deems appropriate, including attorneys’ fees if applicable and justified under law.

JURY TRIAL DEMAND
Plaintiff requests trial by jury on all issues so triable.
