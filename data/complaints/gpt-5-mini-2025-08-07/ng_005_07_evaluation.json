It explains the heightened vigilance required when backing, the effect of the child\u2019s incapacity for care, and how negligence of a custodian interacts with the defendant\u2019s liability, thereby serving as authority on the cited tort concepts, particularly breach and causation.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The backing of any vehicle entails more or less limitation on the view by the driver of the area to be traversed and thus requires corresponding vigilance on his part to avoid causing injury to persons who are known to be, or likely to be, there, whether the vehicle is being backed on a public street or on private land. \u2026 Although the evidence did not warrant the finding that the plaintiff had sustained the burden of proving that his parents exercised due care and even if it had affirmatively appeared that they did not exercise such care and were negligent in leaving him to play in the yard, the plaintiff would not be barred from recovery if such negligence were not the proximate cause of his injury."
