PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Docket No.: ___________________

Lisa Thompson
Plaintiff

v.

Mark Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Residence
1.1 Plaintiff: Lisa Thompson, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.
1.2 Defendant: Mark Johnson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.
1.3 Child: Ethan Johnson, born in 2017 (age 8), subject of this complaint.

2. Jurisdiction and Original Order
2.1 This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the minor child pursuant to the existing custody order entered in this Court on April 15, 2018.
2.2 The parties seek modification of the 2018 order as it relates to physical custody/parenting time (visitation) of the minor child.

3. Current Custody Arrangement
3.1 The 2018 order provides that Plaintiff is the child's primary physical custodian.
3.2 The 2018 order grants Defendant three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit; the order specifically provides that Defendant shall have no overnight parenting time.

4. Material Change in Circumstances (Grounds for Modification)
Plaintiff alleges the following material and substantial changes in circumstances since entry of the 2018 order which warrant modification in the best interests of the child:
4.1 Change in parental housing: At the time of the original order (when Ethan was three years old), Defendant did not have appropriate housing for overnights and had only a room in a shared apartment with roommates. Defendant now has secured his own apartment in which the child has his own bedroom suitable for overnight stays.
4.2 Child's age, maturity, and needs: Ethan is now eight years old, in full-time school, and expresses an ongoing desire to have regular overnight stays with his father. Ethan's age and maturity make a transition to occasional overnights appropriate and consistent with his developmental needs.
4.3 Current schedule disrupts school routines: The existing short-visit schedule requires frequent shuttling of Ethan back and forth during school evenings and weekend travel, which has interfered with consistent bedtime and homework routines, causing fatigue and difficulty maintaining stable school routines.
4.4 Mutual recognition that schedule should be adjusted: Both parents agree that the current short-visit schedule is no longer appropriate and that a revised schedule that allows for reasonable overnight parenting time and reduces disruptive school-night travel is in the child's best interests.
4.5 Because of the foregoing, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 order that affects the welfare of the child and warrants modification of the order.

5. Best Interests of the Child
5.1 Modification of the current order to provide Defendant with reasonable overnight parenting time and an adjusted schedule that minimizes school-night travel is in Ethan’s best interests because it will:
- Promote stable routines for school, homework, and sleep;
- Allow meaningful parent-child bonding time with Defendant in a safe and appropriate home environment;
- Reduce the child's fatigue and school disruption caused by frequent short transfers; and
- Honor the child's expressed wishes appropriate to his age and maturity, while maintaining Plaintiff as primary physical custodian.

6. Proposed Modified Order (Relief Requested)
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:
6.1 Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the April 15, 2018 custody order and that modification is appropriate and in the best interests of the child;
6.2 Modify the custody/parenting-time provisions of the April 15, 2018 order as follows (proposed sample modification; Plaintiff requests the Court enter an order consistent with these or similar provisions that the Court finds appropriate in the child’s best interests):
   a. Primary physical custody of the minor child, Ethan Johnson, shall remain with Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson.
   b. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, shall be granted regular overnight parenting time as follows:
      i. Alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 6:00 p.m. if no school) through Sunday at 6:00 p.m.; and
      ii. One mid-week overnight each week, for example Wednesday evening after school (or 6:00 p.m.) through Thursday morning (or 8:00 a.m.), subject to reasonable adjustment by agreement of the parties to accommodate school or other obligations.
   c. The parties shall confer in good faith to work out an established holiday and school-break parenting-time schedule; absent agreement, the Court shall set a schedule on motion.
   d. The parties shall coordinate to minimize disruptions to the child’s school routine, including arranging exchanges at school or at a mutually agreeable location when feasible.
   e. Defendant shall maintain suitable housing for the child during overnights and shall notify Plaintiff of any change in residence or household composition.
6.3 Order that the parties attend mediation or parenting coordination if requested by either party or ordered by the Court to resolve scheduling or transition issues;
6.4 Set a hearing on this Complaint at the Court’s earliest convenience and provide such temporary orders as the Court deems appropriate pending final hearing;
6.5 Award such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

7. Verification and Certification
7.1 Plaintiff certifies, under the pains and penalties of perjury, that the allegations contained in this Complaint are true and accurate to the best of her knowledge.
