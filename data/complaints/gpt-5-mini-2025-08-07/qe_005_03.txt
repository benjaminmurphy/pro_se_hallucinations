COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff, Jessica Harmon, by and through undersigned counsel (or pro se), brings this Complaint against Defendant, Mark Sullivan, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harmon (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Harmon”) is an individual and resident of Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides at 45 Beacon Street, Apartment [Second Floor], Somerville, MA 02143.

2. Defendant Mark Sullivan (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the landlord and owner of the premises at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143 and may be served at that address or at any other location where he may be found.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant are parties to a written lease (the “Lease”) for Plaintiff’s occupation of the premises beginning January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,800.00.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court because the rental premises are located in Somerville and the events giving rise to this claim occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff is a lawful tenant occupying the second-floor apartment at 45 Beacon Street (the “Premises”).

6. Approximately six months prior to the filing of this Complaint (spring 2025), new occupants moved into the apartment directly above Plaintiff’s unit. Since moving in, the occupants of the unit above Plaintiff have engaged in repeated, ongoing, and disruptive conduct characterized by loud stomping, playing loud music late at night, dragging or moving furniture after midnight, and other excessive noise that is unreasonable and substantially interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment.

7. Plaintiff has personally spoken to the upstairs occupants and asked them to reduce the noise. They reduced their conduct only temporarily — for about a week — then resumed the same excessive noise.

8. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant on at least five or six occasions about the continuing excessive noise and the disruptive conduct by the upstairs occupants. On one occasion Defendant spoke to the upstairs occupants but took no effective remedial action. On subsequent complaints Defendant stated that he “can’t control how people live.”

9. Plaintiff’s written Lease contains an express covenant entitling Plaintiff to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises. In addition, Plaintiff has the common-law and statutory rights of a tenant to the quiet enjoyment of her apartment.

10. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to abate the noise or otherwise enforce the Lease against the occupants above Plaintiff’s apartment.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to prevent or abate the nuisance and Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered severe and continuing interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises, including an inability to sleep for reasonable periods (averaging approximately four to five hours per night).

12. The excessive noise has caused concrete damages to Plaintiff, including but not limited to: (a) a written warning at work for falling asleep on the job; (b) medical costs and prescriptions related to treatment for sleep disturbance — specifically, sleep medication costing $40 per month; (c) the purchase of earplugs and a white-noise machine; and (d) loss of the full benefit of the bargain of her lease. Plaintiff estimates non-economic and out-of-pocket damages in the amount of approximately $2,000.00 and reserves the right to amend this amount after discovery.

13. All conditions precedent to this action have been satisfied, waived, or otherwise performed.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law; Massachusetts)

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts common law, every tenancy includes an implied and/or express covenant of quiet enjoyment whereby the landlord is obligated to ensure that the tenant’s possession and enjoyment of the premises will not be substantially and unreasonably disturbed by the landlord or persons for whom the landlord is legally responsible. See generally M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord & Tenant statutes); see also cases recognizing and enforcing the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

16. By entering into the Lease and accepting rent, Defendant undertook the duty to provide Plaintiff with possession and the ordinary and peaceful use of the Premises. Defendant’s repeated failure to abate the excessive noise and his stated refusal or inability to control the tenants above Plaintiff’s unit constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, both express (under the Lease’s express promise) and implied (under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and the common law).

17. Defendant’s conduct was a direct and proximate cause of the substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and caused Plaintiff to incur economic damages and non-economic harms, as alleged above.

18. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including compensation for past and future lost use and enjoyment of the Premises, out-of-pocket expenses, any demonstrable medical expenses and related losses, and statutory costs and interest as allowed by law.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment and applicable Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and caselaw, including but not limited to:

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general statutory framework governing landlord and tenant rights and obligations)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process) (procedures for possession and other landlord-tenant remedies)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection) (relevant to landlord conduct in some contexts; applicable authority respecting landlord duties in certain circumstances)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140 (regulation of nuisances and noise in certain local contexts)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (health and sanitary regulations applicable to housing conditions)
- Mass. Rules of Civil Procedure (governing pleadings, discovery, and relief)

Selected Massachusetts Caselaw Recognizing or Discussing Quiet Enjoyment and Landlord Obligations (representative, non-exhaustive)
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (as persuasive authority for the scope of the covenant of quiet enjoyment)
- Cases and authorities establishing that a landlord may be responsible where a tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment is substantially interfered with by others for whom the landlord is responsible (see, e.g., Massachusetts caselaw recognizing landlord responsibility for nuisances and for enforcement of lease covenants)
- Decisions construing M.G.L. ch. 186 and the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment and awarding damages where landlord failed to abate persistent, unreasonable disturbances to a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises
- Massachusetts appellate decisions addressing tenant remedies for landlord breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, and setting forth measures of damages and injunctive relief

(Plaintiff will rely on the foregoing statutes, rules, and relevant Massachusetts decisions, and any other authorities developed through discovery and briefing, to establish liability and appropriate relief.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $2,000.00 (or in the amount proved at trial) for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses (medical expenses, sleep medication, earplugs, white-noise machine) and other damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach;

B. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

C. Award Plaintiff costs of suit, including filing fees and other taxable costs;

D. Grant such injunctive and/or equitable relief as the Court deems just and proper to abate the ongoing disturbance (including an order requiring Defendant to take reasonable steps to stop the unreasonable noise and enforce the lease against the upstairs occupants), if the Court deems injunctive relief appropriate; and

E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
