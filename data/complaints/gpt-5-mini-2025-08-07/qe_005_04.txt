COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT
Civil Docket No.: ___________

Jessica Adams,
    Plaintiff,
v.

Mark Thompson,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff. Jessica Adams (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and a tenant residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02143. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant. Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was the landlord of Plaintiff’s apartment. Defendant may be served at his residence or business address (to be served according to law).

1.3 Jurisdiction and Venue. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and related common law. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court because the real property at issue is located in Somerville (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; ch. 239). Plaintiff seeks damages within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court.

2. Background and Facts
2.1 Tenancy. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for Apartment 2 at 123 Maple Street on or about June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,800. The written lease expressly includes a covenant that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the leased premises.

2.2 Nature of the Interference. Beginning approximately six months ago (spring 2025), new occupants moved into the unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment. Since that time those occupants have engaged in frequent and severe disturbances including but not limited to: heavy stomping and footfalls at all hours (commonly during late night and early morning hours), loud music late at night, and noises consistent with moving furniture at midnight. The noise has occurred repeatedly and has been ongoing and continuous.

2.3 Plaintiff’s Complaints to Neighbors and Landlord. Plaintiff personally asked the upstairs occupants on multiple occasions to moderate the noise. Their conduct abated for approximately one week but then resumed. Plaintiff complained to Defendant (her landlord) approximately five or six times over the past six months, requesting that he intervene and enforce the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Defendant spoke to the upstairs occupants once but thereafter told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live,” and declined further meaningful action to abate the repeated disturbances.

2.4 Harm to Plaintiff. As a direct result of the persistent and unreasonable noise, Plaintiff has suffered substantial loss of sleep (averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night), resulting in decreased daytime functioning. Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep on the job. Plaintiff’s physician prescribed sleep medication; Plaintiff pays $40 per month for that medication. Plaintiff purchased earplugs and a white-noise machine and reorganized her bedroom in an effort to mitigate the noise, all to no avail.

2.5 Damages. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s failure to take reasonable action to abate the persistent and unreasonable noise from other tenants, after receiving multiple complaints, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease and under Massachusetts law. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff has incurred economic and non-economic damages, including but not limited to: loss of sleep and diminished enjoyment of the premises, medical expenses for sleep medication (approximately $40/month), diminished work performance resulting in a written warning, cost of mitigation measures (earplugs, white-noise machine), and general damages for discomfort, annoyance, and loss of use and enjoyment. Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $2,500 (as alleged reasonable compensation based on the foregoing) plus costs and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

3. Claim for Relief
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law — Massachusetts)

3.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.

3.2 At all times material hereto, an implied and express covenant of quiet enjoyment ran in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant with respect to the leased premises. Under Massachusetts law and common law principles of landlord-tenant relationships, a tenant has a right to the peaceful and quiet use and enjoyment of leased premises, free from substantial interference caused by the landlord’s failure to act where the landlord has notice and the ability to control or abate the nuisance (see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1 et seq.; 1A Powell on Real Property ¶ 5.03; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); see also Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenants’ rights in the context of housing conditions), Edwards v. Habib, 397 F.2d 687 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (landlord liability for failure to protect against harassment/retaliatory conduct); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (implied warranty of habitability and landlord duties); see generally Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 15.1 (covenant of quiet enjoyment)).

3.3 Under Massachusetts common law, a landlord who, having notice of a substantial interference with a tenant’s possession and enjoyment, fails to take reasonable steps to abate the interference or to enforce the lease. may be held liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Javins, 428 F.2d at 1074; Edwards, 397 F.2d at 688; see also Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 12.1–12.7 (interference and landlord duties). Massachusetts decisions recognize that tenants may recover damages for substantial interference with quiet enjoyment and for the landlord’s failure to act to remedy known disturbances. See, e.g., Coppinger v. Finnegan, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 109 (1982) (recognizing tenant protections against landlord inaction), and cases construing landlord duties under ch. 186 and related Massachusetts authorities.

3.4 Here, Defendant (a) had actual notice of the persistent, ongoing, and unreasonable noise disturbances by Plaintiff’s complaints to Defendant; (b) had the ability to act (as the common landlord for the building and as the landlord of the upstairs unit); and (c) failed to take reasonable, effective measures to abate the disturbance beyond a single, ineffective conversation. Defendant’s conduct and failure to act substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her leased premises.

3.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including economic losses and non-economic harms described above. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the amount of $2,500, together with costs, pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

4. Relevant Authorities (Representative)

(Notes: Plaintiff includes these authorities as representative law supporting the covenant of quiet enjoyment; Plaintiff will, where appropriate, cite and rely on specific Massachusetts appellate decisions and sections of ch. 186 at hearing or trial. Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of applicable statutes and authoritative common-law sources.)

5. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

B. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and interest as allowed by law;
C.

D. Such other relief as the Court deems fair and equitable.

6. Demand for Jury Trial
