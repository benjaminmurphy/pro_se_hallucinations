I can draft the complaint for you, but I need to be direct: I cannot invent or fabricate case citations or statutory references that I cannot verify. The developer instructions you provided asked for at least ten cases and statutes, but I must not provide inaccurate legal authorities. I will therefore prepare a complete, professionally formatted complaint containing the factual allegations, single cause of action (breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law), prayer for relief, signature block, and citations to key Massachusetts statutory provisions I can reliably identify (and to widely recognized secondary authority). If you want precise case citations to support the claim, I can add those later if you want me to look them up or provide the names of cases you prefer. Below is the drafted complaint based strictly on the facts you provided.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT

Jessica Howard
Plaintiff

v.                                              Civil Action No.: __________

Thomas Green
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Howard (“Plaintiff” or “Howard”) is an individual and a tenant residing at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Apartment [insert apt. no. if any], Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02138.

2. Defendant Thomas Green (“Defendant” or “Green”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138, and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written or verbal residential tenancy for the described premises, with Plaintiff taking possession and beginning the tenancy on January 15, 2022. The monthly rent for the premises is $2,500, which Plaintiff pays to Defendant.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action under Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Cambridge District Court because the premises are located in Cambridge and the events giving rise to this claim occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Beginning approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Defendant caused and permitted substantial renovation and construction activity at or in the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment (the “Renovation”).

6. The Renovation has produced continuous and significant daytime noise—drilling, hammering, loud conversations among workers, and other construction-related sounds—generally occurring on weekdays from about 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

7. Plaintiff works from home. The noise from the Renovation has materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and has repeatedly interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to concentrate and conduct work-related telephone and video calls.

8. The Renovation has also resulted in construction dust entering Plaintiff’s apartment through vents and other pathways, causing further interference with comfort and use of the premises.

9. Defendant did provide Plaintiff with prior notice of the Renovation and the work has generally been performed during daytime hours. On at least one occasion Defendant offered Plaintiff a temporary rent reduction of $100 off one month’s rent in an effort to compensate for the disruption. Plaintiff accepted notice and considered the offer, but the offered reduction is inadequate to compensate for the sustained and ongoing loss of the right to quiet enjoyment.

10. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the Renovation may continue for an additional one to two months beyond the already two-month period of construction.

11. The Renovation and associated noise and dust substantially and unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and are not the natural and foreseeable consequences of ordinary residential occupancy.

12. Plaintiff has not abandoned the premises. Plaintiff has at all times been ready, willing, and able to pay rent in full, and has continued to pay rent. Plaintiff asserts that the continuing interference constitutes a breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law, Massachusetts)

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is contained in every lease and tenancy: a tenant is entitled to possession and use of the leased premises without substantial and unreasonable interference by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s authority.

15. Defendant, by permitting, authorizing, and/or conducting the Renovation in a manner that has produced continuous, substantial noise and dust that unreasonably interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. The continued interference from the Renovation has caused Plaintiff actual damages, including but not limited to loss of the full benefit of quiet use of the premises, interference with ability to work at home and to earn income, diminished habitability and comfort, and emotional distress.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial but currently estimated by Plaintiff to be $3,000. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional damages should further assessment reveal greater harm.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. A judgment that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts law;

B. Compensatory damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $3,000, or such other amount as a jury or the Court finds just and proper, to compensate Plaintiff for interference with quiet enjoyment, lost use and comfort, and related harms;

C. A preliminary and permanent injunction, if appropriate and necessary, ordering Defendant to take all reasonable measures to abate excessive noise and dust from the Renovation so as to prevent continued substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, including reasonable mitigation measures (e.g., scheduling heavy noisy work outside of Plaintiff’s working hours when feasible, providing adequate dust containment and ventilation safeguards, and/or other reasonable accommodations);

D. An order awarding Plaintiff costs of suit and other relief as the Court deems just and equitable;

E. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

PLAINTIFF HEREBY DEMANDS TRIAL BY JURY ON ALL ISSUES SO TRIABLE.

NOTES ON AUTHORITIES AND FURTHER SUPPORT

- The Complaint is brought under the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment, as recognized in Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and applied in Massachusetts courts. Massachusetts statutory provisions that govern landlord-tenant relationships and summary process generally include Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186 (landlord and tenant) and chapter 239 (summary process/eviction). If you would like, I can supplement this Complaint with precise Massachusetts case law and additional statutory citations (including SJC and Appeals Court cases recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and awarding damages or injunctive relief for landlord-caused interference). I can also add tailored citations to cases on landlord renovations, constructive eviction, and remedies for interference with quiet enjoyment. Because I must not invent or speculate about specific case citations, I will add precise reported cases only if you instruct me to find and include verified authorities.

If you want me to proceed and add verified Massachusetts cases and pinpoint statutory subsections, tell me and I will follow up with accurately sourced authorities and, if you want, a cover memo explaining the legal framework and how the cited cases support the Complaint.
