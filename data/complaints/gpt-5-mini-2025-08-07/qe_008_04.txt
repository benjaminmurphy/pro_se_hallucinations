Michael Thompson,                              
    Defendant.                                  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Parties, Residence, and Jurisdiction
   1.1. Plaintiff Emily Santos (hereinafter “Plaintiff”) is an individual and a tenant residing at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.
   1.2. Defendant Michael Thompson (hereinafter “Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, Massachusetts and the landlord of Plaintiff’s tenancy.
   1.3. Plaintiff began her tenancy at 45 Broadway St on June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,600.
   1.4. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Chelsea District Court because the subject property is located in Chelsea, Massachusetts and the amount in controversy is within this Court’s jurisdictional limits.

2. Nature of Action
   2.1. This action is brought solely for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law based on Defendant’s failure to secure and maintain the common entry door (a material part of the premises) after notice, which materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her leased premises.

3. Facts Common to All Claims
   3.1. The main entry door to the building at 45 Broadway St (the “Door”) has a broken lock that does not latch properly; the Door can be pushed open by unauthorized persons.
   3.2. Plaintiff informed Defendant of the broken Door approximately two months before the filing of this Complaint (in or about October 2025). Defendant stated he would fix the Door but did not do so.
   3.3. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the Door problem on two subsequent occasions; Defendant did not effectuate a repair.
   3.4. In or about November 2025, an unknown person(s) entered the building through the unsecured Door and went through mail and packages left in the common hallway. Multiple tenants had packages stolen from the hallway.
   3.5. Plaintiff lost a package valued at approximately $120 as a result of the theft.
   3.6. Plaintiff has observed evidence that an unknown person(s) has been sleeping in the building basement, which is accessible from inside the building. The presence of an unauthorized occupant in the basement has caused Plaintiff to fear for her personal safety and to suffer an objectively reasonable disturbance of her enjoyment of the premises.
   3.7. Because Defendant failed to repair or secure the Door, Plaintiff purchased a security camera for her interior door and paid for a better deadbolt to secure her unit door at a personal cost of approximately $200.
   3.8. Plaintiff reported these concerns to Defendant and asked Defendant to secure/repair the Door; Defendant minimized the problem and said Plaintiff was “overreacting” and that the neighborhood is safe, but did not repair the Door or otherwise secure common areas.
   3.9. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair and secure the common entry door after notice, Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises have been substantially and unreasonably interfered with, causing actual loss and expense to Plaintiff totaling approximately $320 (comprising $120 in stolen property and approximately $200 in security-related expenses).

4. Legal Background (authorities cited relevant to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations)
   4.1. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s actions or failures that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied covenant in residential tenancies and is recognized at common law. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (general principles of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations); see also Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant protections where conditions render premises untenantable); accord Massachusetts cases recognizing landlord duties to maintain premises and tenant remedies under state law.
   4.2. Massachusetts statutes and regulations underscore landlord obligations to maintain safe and sanitary premises and to eliminate conditions that threaten health and safety, including the State Sanitary Code: 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), which is implemented under the public health statutes, see M.G.L. c. 111, §127A and related provisions enabling enforcement of housing standards.
   4.3. The Massachusetts landlord–tenant statutory framework governing landlord obligations and tenant protections is found in M.G.L. c. 186 (general provisions governing tenancies), including provisions addressing landlord duties and remedies, and M.G.L. c. 239 (summary process) where applicable to possession disputes.
   4.4. Consumers and tenants harmed by landlord misconduct are protected by statutory and common-law remedies recognized in Massachusetts; the broad consumer protection statute M.G.L. c. 93A and other statutory provisions provide context for landlord duties and tenant recourse where appropriate. See M.G.L. c. 93A §§2, 11; M.G.L. c. 186 §§14, 15B; M.G.L. c. 111 §127A; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §15.4; Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (for general principle that substantial interference may give rise to tenant remedies).

   4.6. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s conduct (failing to repair the Door after notice and refusing to secure common areas) constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and is actionable under Massachusetts law and applicable common-law principles and statutes referenced above.

5. Cause of Action
   Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts law)
   5.1. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 4.6 as if fully set forth herein.
   5.2. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in Plaintiff’s residential lease and requires that Plaintiff have the right to quiet and peaceful use and enjoyment of her leased premises without substantial and unreasonable interference by the landlord.
   5.3. Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to maintain the common entry door and common areas in a reasonably safe and secure condition and to take reasonable action to prevent foreseeable intrusions and criminal acts facilitated by an insecure Door, after notice of the condition.
   5.4. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to timely repair or secure the Door after being notified by Plaintiff that the Door’s lock did not latch; by failing to secure common areas; and by otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to protect tenants from foreseeable intrusions and thefts.
   5.5. Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of (a) theft of Plaintiff’s package valued at approximately $120; (b) Plaintiff’s reasonable expenditures for security measures and a new deadbolt of approximately $200; (c) emotional distress and loss of use and enjoyment of the premises caused by fear for personal safety and the presence of unauthorized persons in the building; and (d) other damages to be proven at trial.
   5.6. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in an amount of approximately $320, plus costs and any other allowable relief.

6. Prayer for Relief
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:
   6.1. Awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $320 (or such other amount as proved at trial) for the loss of stolen property and Plaintiff’s security-related expenditures caused by Defendant’s breach;
   6.2. Entering an order requiring Defendant to repair and secure the main entry door and to take reasonable measures to secure common areas of the building to prevent further unauthorized access and theft (injunctive and/or mandatory relief);
   6.3. Awarding Plaintiff costs of suit and filing fees;
   6.4. Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including, if applicable, interest and any statutory remedies available under Massachusetts law; and
   6.5. Granting Plaintiff leave to amend or supplement this Complaint as additional facts or remedies become known.

7. Demand for Jury Trial
   7.1. Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
