COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

Emily Carter
Plaintiff,
v.                                                    Docket No. ___________

Marcus Greenfield
Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter ("Plaintiff") is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who rents residential premises at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA (the "Premises"). Plaintiff began renting the Premises on June 1, 2022, and is the tenant of record for the unit.

2. Defendant Marcus Greenfield ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the Premises and conducts landlord business in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Defendant may be served at the Premises or at his business or residence address if known.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Cambridge District Court because the Premises are located in Cambridge, the acts and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in Cambridge, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff is a tenant of the Premises and has paid rent in the amount of $2,200 per month.

5. Beginning approximately on or about October 1, 2025 (about two months prior to the date of this filing), Defendant commenced substantial renovations and construction activity on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s unit.

6. The renovation activity has involved daily audible construction noise—drilling, hammering, and loud worker conversations—occurring generally between approximately 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays. The activity has continued for each weekday since about October 1, 2025, and Defendant has indicated the work may continue for an additional one to two months.

7. Plaintiff works from home and routinely participates in work calls and other remote work requiring concentration and a reasonably quiet environment. The sustained daytime construction noise has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises for the purposes for which they are rented, including work from home and normal residential use of the unit.

8. In addition to noise, dust and construction particulate matter from the renovation has entered Plaintiff’s unit through vents and other openings, contributing to indoor air quality problems and interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff in advance of the renovation and the hours of work and has maintained that workers keep "reasonable hours." Defendant offered a single, small rent reduction of approximately $100 for one month, which Plaintiff rejected as inadequate to compensate for the ongoing loss of quiet enjoyment and interference with habitability and use of the Premises.

10. The construction has continued without adequate mitigation (for example, additional dust control, sealing between units, sound-reduction measures, or a more meaningful rent abatement), and Defendant has not cured the substantial interference to Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment despite notice and complaints.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)

11. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth herein.

12. Under Massachusetts law, every tenancy carries with it an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment: landlords must not substantially interfere with a tenant’s possession and use of the leased premises. The covenant protects tenants against substantial and unreasonable interference with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or persons acting on the landlord’s behalf. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant law) and Massachusetts common law recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment (common-law sources and treatises such as the Restatement (Second) of Property describe the covenant and its elements).

13. Defendant, by permitting, directing, or failing to prevent or mitigate prolonged and substantial daytime construction activity and associated dust intrusion from the adjacent unit, has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and beneficial use of the Premises.

14. The interference is material and not de minimis: the sustained daily drilling, hammering, and loud worker activity during the hours Plaintiff must work, and the intrusion of dust into the living space, have deprived Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment of the dwelling for the purposes for which it was rented (including a reasonable environment for working from home and ingress/egress, safety, and healthful occupancy).

15. Defendant’s offer of a one-time $100 rent reduction is inadequate to compensate for the ongoing and continuing loss of use of the Premises, and Defendant has failed to take reasonable steps to abate the interference, such as meaningful rent abatement for the prolonged period of interference, improved dust control, sealing of vents and openings, installation of temporary sound barriers, or schedule adjustments to reduce disruption to Plaintiff.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered economic damages, including but not limited to diminution in value of the use of the Premises, loss of use, interference with work and employment, and other general and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial but reasonably estimated at $2,000.

17. Plaintiff has given Defendant notice of the interference (both before and during the renovation), and Defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to cure the interference and mitigate damages, but has failed to do so.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $2,000 (or such other amount proven at trial) as compensation for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. Order a rent abatement or credit for the period of substantial interference in an amount to be determined at trial;

C. Enjoin Defendant from continuing construction practices at the adjacent unit that unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, or order reasonable mitigation measures (for example, requiring dust-control measures, sealing vents between units, imposing noise abatement measures, or limiting work hours where necessary);

D. Award Plaintiff pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

E. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action and any allowable statutory costs; and

F. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Authorities)

Plaintiff intends to rely on the following authorities and related Massachusetts common law recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations to tenants (this list is representative and not exclusive):

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Massachusetts landlord–tenant statute generally governing landlord and tenant rights and obligations).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process statute; jurisdictional context for landlord-tenant disputes in Massachusetts courts).

- Massachusetts common-law principles recognizing an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and remedies for breach (Plaintiff will rely on applicable Massachusetts decisions and precedent; case law will be cited as appropriate in pleading amendments or at trial).
- Applicable provisions regarding nuisance and habitability recognized in Massachusetts law and regulations addressing landlord maintenance obligations and tenant habitability rights.
- Any other statutes, regulations, ordinances, case law, and secondary authorities raised or cited at hearing or trial relevant to landlord-tenant obligations, noise/dust control, and remedies for breach of quiet enjoyment.

(If the Court requires more specific case citations and/or statutory subsections in this initial filing, Plaintiff will amend or supplement this filing to provide those citations; Plaintiff has not included an exhaustive list of cases in this initial complaint but will provide the specific Massachusetts cases relied upon in support of the covenant in any further filings or at trial.)

Notes for the Plaintiff:
- This complaint asserts a single cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts common law and requests monetary damages, injunctive relief, and rent abatement. If you want, I can now:
  - (a) prepare a version that cites specific Massachusetts appellate decisions and statutory subsections with pinpoint citations (I will need to conduct legal citation research to ensure accuracy), or
  - (b) prepare a shortened/simplified version for small-claims or for submission in person at the Clerk’s office.

If you would like me to prepare a version with specific Massachusetts case law citations and statutory subsection references, say so and I will prepare and provide that researched version. I will not fabricate case names or citations; any additional cases/authorities I include will be accurate and verifiable.
