COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by self-representation, complains against Defendant Michael Anderson ("Defendant"), and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an adult resident of Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff's contact information is 123 Elm Street, Apartment [second-floor apartment], Somerville, MA 02143; telephone (617) 555-0123; email psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Anderson is the landlord and owner of the building located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, where Plaintiff rents the second-floor apartment.

3. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy/lease for the apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA on January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,500.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter and personal jurisdiction over Defendant because the rental property and the events giving rise to this action are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Somerville District Court.

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to the Massachusetts venue statutes and local rules because the dwelling is located in Somerville and the actions giving rise to this complaint occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff has occupied the second-floor apartment at 123 Elm Street since January 15, 2022 under a written lease that includes an express covenant of quiet enjoyment (the "Lease").

7. Beginning approximately six months prior to the filing of this complaint (approximately June 2025), new tenants moved into the third-floor unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment.

8. Since those tenants moved in, Plaintiff has been subjected to pervasive, recurring, and unreasonable noise caused by the upstairs tenants, including but not limited to loud stomping and heavy foot traffic at all hours, loud music late at night, and sounds consistent with moving heavy furniture at or around midnight.

9. The excessive noise has occurred most nights and at times when Plaintiff would normally sleep. Plaintiff estimates that, during the period of disturbance, she has been averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night.

10. Plaintiff personally spoke with the upstairs tenants about the noise on at least one occasion. They reduced the noise for approximately one week and then resumed loud conduct.

11. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant (her landlord) approximately five or six separate times over the past six months, requesting that Defendant take reasonable steps to stop or abate the noise. On one such occasion Defendant spoke with the upstairs tenants once and subsequently told Plaintiff that he "can't control how people live."

12. Despite Plaintiff's repeated complaints and Defendant's control and authority as landlord over common areas and tenancy relations, Defendant has failed to take reasonable steps to abate the disturbance or otherwise protect Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment.

13. As a direct and proximate result of the ongoing noise and Defendant's failure to take reasonable remedial action, Plaintiff has suffered substantial discomfort and deprivation of the use and enjoyment of her rented premises and has sustained actual damages, including but not limited to:
    a. lost sleep and diminished quality of life;
    b. a written warning at her workplace for falling asleep at her desk;
    c. ongoing medical treatment for sleep disturbance, including prescription sleep medication that costs approximately $40 per month;
    d. out-of-pocket expenses for mitigation efforts such as earplugs and a white-noise machine; and
    e. emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience.

14. Plaintiff estimates total damages arising from the breach and the consequential harms described above at approximately $2,000 to date, and reserves the right to amend this amount as additional damages are quantified.

LEGAL BASIS — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

15. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. The lease between Plaintiff and Defendant included an express covenant of quiet enjoyment. Independent of any express covenant, Massachusetts law recognizes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment inherent in residential tenancies: a tenant has the right to the beneficial and peaceful use and enjoyment of leased premises without substantial interference from landlords or those for whose conduct the landlord is responsible. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §16.1 (implied covenant) (authoritative treatise explaining the covenant); see also cases and authorities cited below.

17. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when, by commission or omission, the landlord substantially interferes with the tenant's use or enjoyment of the premises or fails to take reasonable steps within the landlord's control to abate a continuing and unreasonable disturbance caused by others occupying the building. See, e.g., Massachusetts cases and authorities construing the covenant (authorities listed below).

18. Defendant's repeated failure to take reasonable remedial action after repeated complaints by Plaintiff constituted a breach of the express and implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. Defendant's statement that he "can't control how people live," followed by no further effective remedial measures, was an abdication of the landlord's obligation to protect Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment where the landlord had the capacity to act and the disturbance was recurring and severe.

19. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant's breach, Plaintiff suffered the damages described above.

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts common law)

20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.

21. Defendant owed Plaintiff the covenant of quiet enjoyment under the Lease and under Massachusetts law.

22. Defendant breached that covenant by failing to prevent or abate ongoing and substantial noise disturbances by other tenants over whom Defendant had authority and responsibility to control or to compel compliance with the Lease.

23. As a proximate result of Defendant's breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including out-of-pocket expenses, diminished use and enjoyment of the premises, emotional distress, lost wages/opportunities (including a written warning at work due to falling asleep), and additional medical expenses of at least $40/month for prescription medication, and seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial but currently estimated at $2,000.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under the lease and under Massachusetts law;

B. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial and presently estimated at no less than $2,000, including actual out-of-pocket expenses, medical expenses, and other consequential damages;

C. An order directing Defendant to take reasonable steps to abate the excessive noise and prevent further substantial interference with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment, including, if necessary, ordering Defendant to enforce lease provisions against the upstairs tenants, to require remediation, or to undertake reasonable measures within Defendant's control to prevent future disturbance;

D. Costs of suit and reasonable filing fees;

E. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law; and

F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

GOVERNING AUTHORITIES (select statutory and case authorities relevant to quiet enjoyment)

Statutes and other authorities:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Massachusetts landlord and tenant law) (general statutory framework governing landlord-tenant relationships).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act) — recognized as relevant to landlord practices in certain contexts (authoritative for remedy and interpretation where applicable).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary process and dispossessories) — framework related to possession and occupancy.
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 16.1–16.5 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties).
- Somerville Municipal Code provisions governing noise and nuisance (local ordinance authority to abate unreasonable noise and disturbance).

Sample Massachusetts authorities addressing quiet enjoyment and landlord responsibilities (representative, not exhaustive):
- Cases recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations to abate substantial interference with tenancy rights under Massachusetts law, including SJC and Appeals Court decisions construing landlord liability when landlord fails to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with tenancy. See, e.g.:
    - cases interpreting the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in landlord-tenant context;
    - prior Massachusetts decisions recognizing landlord responsibility where the landlord's action or inaction produced substantial interference with tenant's use and enjoyment.

(Notes: Representative case law and statutory authority supporting the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations includes numerous SJC and Appeals Court decisions; Plaintiff is prepared to submit and rely on specific Massachusetts authorities and reported decisions at or before hearing or trial as required by the Court. Plaintiff cites the Restatement and the Massachusetts statutory framework as foundational legal authority governing landlord obligations and tenants' remedies.)
