COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA)

Plaintiff Jessica Moore ("Plaintiff" or "Moore") brings this Complaint against Defendant Linda Johnson ("Defendant" or "Johnson") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Defendant is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times acted as landlord of the basement apartment rented by Plaintiff.

3. The tenancy began on or about March 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Housing Court of the City of Boston pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185C and ch. 218, and the Court’s general housing and equity jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes and claims for damages related to breaches of landlord duties and covenants.

5. Venue is proper in this Court because the subject property is located in Roxbury, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Housing Court of the City of Boston.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1–5 above as if fully set forth herein.

7. Plaintiff rented a basement unit at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA beginning March 1, 2022, pursuant to a month-to-month lease/tenancy (the "Tenancy").

8. Plaintiff timely paid rent each month except for one late payment in October 2025, which was approximately two weeks late because Plaintiff incurred medical bills. Plaintiff paid the full rent plus any late fee that Defendant charged.

9. Beginning in November 2025, during heavy rains Plaintiff observed water seeping through the basement wall into the rental unit.

10. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the water intrusion by text message. Defendant replied that she would "look into it."

11. Several weeks passed without repair or remediation. The water intrusion continued whenever it rained heavily.

12. Concerned for health and safety and the habitability of the unit, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston to report the condition.

13. On inspection, a City inspector found the water intrusion and additional code and housing-standard violations. The inspector advised that repairs were necessary.

14. The water intrusion damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf located against the affected wall, causing approximately $400 in property damage.

15. As a result of persistent dampness and to avoid mold and protect belongings, Plaintiff has had to run a dehumidifier constantly. Continuous operation increased Plaintiff’s electric usage and costs.

16. Despite notice of the condition and the City inspection, Defendant has failed and refused to make permanent repairs to correct the water intrusion and related defects.

17. Following the City inspection, Defendant told Plaintiff that she was a "problem tenant" and that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when the tenancy terminates in March 2026. Defendant stated that the basis for nonrenewal was Plaintiff’s late rent in October, but the time and circumstances (close in time to the City inspection and report) make clear that the nonrenewal is at least in part connected to Plaintiff’s having reported the defects and sought enforcement of housing standards.

18. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the known water intrusion and related defects, the continued damp and uninhabitable conditions, the damage to Plaintiff’s property, the increased utility expenses, and Defendant’s threatened retaliatory refusal to renew the tenancy following Plaintiff’s complaint to the City have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

19. Plaintiff has suffered damages including the value of damaged personal property ($400), increased utility costs, emotional distress and inconvenience, and loss of the quiet enjoyment of the premises.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

20. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1–19 as if fully set forth herein.

21. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes tenants the covenant of quiet enjoyment, an implied covenant in residential tenancies that tenants shall have possession and enjoyment of the leased premises free from material interference by the landlord or those claiming under the landlord. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1; and Massachusetts authorities recognizing landlord duties to refrain from conduct that substantially interferes with tenancy.

22. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when a landlord's actions or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including where the landlord fails to remedy dangerous, unhealthy, or uninhabitable conditions of which the landlord is aware and which materially impair the tenant’s use of the premises. See, e.g., cases and authorities recognizing quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations to repair and abate conditions materially affecting habitability (see authorities cited below).

23. Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, among other things:
   a. Failing to repair and remediate the reported water intrusion despite actual notice and a City inspection documenting the condition;
   b. Allowing persistent dampness and water intrusion that damaged Plaintiff’s personal property and required continuous operation of a dehumidifier to avoid mold and further damage;
   c. Engaging in conduct reasonably understood by Plaintiff to be retaliatory — including labeling Plaintiff a "problem tenant" and announcing an intention not to renew the lease shortly after Plaintiff complained to the City — thereby interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to enforce health and safety standards and to enjoy the tenancy without fear of reprisal.

24. Defendant’s breach was knowing or at least willful in that Defendant received actual notice of the condition (by Plaintiff’s communications and by the City inspection) and chose not to remedy the condition.

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, including actual damages for personal property loss (approximately $400), increased utility expenses, emotional distress, and other consequential damages.

26. Plaintiff seeks an award of compensatory damages, costs, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper, including an order directing Defendant to repair the defect and to abate hazardous or uninhabitable conditions on the premises.
