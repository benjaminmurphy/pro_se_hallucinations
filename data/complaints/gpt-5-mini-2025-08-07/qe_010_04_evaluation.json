The discussion of quiet enjoyment appears only in a footnote explaining constructive eviction doctrine and expressly focuses the present case on failure to maintain habitability, not on quiet enjoyment claims. Thus, the case supports landlord liability for breach of an implied warranty of habitability and related rent and damage remedies, but it does not hold that such failures constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment itself.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe have concluded that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in this state and that the breach of such a warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. Under the implied warranty which we recognize, a residential landlord covenants that premises he leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. \u2026 If the trial court does find a breach of implied warranty, the court must then determine the extent of the damages flowing from this breach.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely concerns adoption and enforcement of an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, not the traditional covenant of quiet enjoyment. The court explains that constructive eviction (historically tied to quiet enjoyment) is no longer needed and that the tenant\u2019s remedies\u2014including reimbursement of rent and discomfort/annoyance damages\u2014flow from breach of the implied warranty of habitability and contract principles, not from a covenant of quiet enjoyment. Thus, the case supports landlord liability for habitability-based damages, but not under the rubric of quiet enjoyment as stated in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Therefore, we now hold expressly that in the rental of any residential dwelling unit an implied warranty exists in the lease, whether oral or written, that the landlord will deliver over and maintain, throughout the period of the tenancy, premises that are safe, clean and fit for human habitation. \u2026 Because of our holding in this case, the doctrine of constructive eviction, wherein the tenant must abandon in order to escape liability for rent, is no longer viable. \u2026 Under our holding, when a landlord breaches the implied warranty of habitability, the tenant may withhold future rent, and may also seek damages in the amount of rent previously paid."
