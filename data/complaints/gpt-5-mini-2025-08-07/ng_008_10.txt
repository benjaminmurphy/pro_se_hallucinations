COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1.     Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Thompson"), pro se, brings this action against Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC ("Defendant" or "Quincy Bistro") for personal injuries sustained as the result of Defendant’s negligence. Plaintiff seeks damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other relief as set forth below.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2.     Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at telephone number (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

3.     Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company that does business as a restaurant at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts, and was the owner/occupier/operator of the premises where the incident occurred. Defendant may be served at its place of business.

4.     This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under Massachusetts law because the claim arises from a tort committed in the Commonwealth. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in the County of Norfolk.

FACTS

5.     On August 15, 2023, at approximately dinnertime, Plaintiff was lawfully present as an invitee at Quincy Bistro located at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.

6.     At about that time in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, a restaurant server dropped a tray containing several water glasses. Some of the glasses broke. The server picked up the broken glass promptly but left water and ice on the tile floor.

7.     The server told others she would "be right back with a mop" but did not place any wet-floor sign or any other warning to alert customers or staff to the spilled water and ice.

8.     Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose to go to the restroom and, while walking through the narrow hallway, stepped onto the still-wet tile surface. The water on the tile was visible as a glistening puddle but was not marked or barricaded; Plaintiff reasonably did not appreciate the hazard until she was already stepping on it.

9.     As a direct and proximate result of the unmarked wet floor, Plaintiff slipped, twisted her knee, and fell. Plaintiff sustained a sprained knee and was treated at an urgent care facility. Plaintiff subsequently was placed in a knee brace and required multiple sessions of physical therapy.

10.    After the incident Plaintiff overheard restaurant staff comment that they had been "dodging that puddle" for some time, indicating the hazard had existed long enough and was known or should have been known to Defendant’s employees.

11.    Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500.00 in medical expenses relating to treatment for her knee injury and lost approximately $2,000.00 in wages due to inability to work while receiving treatment and undergoing physical therapy.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

12.    Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–11 above.

13.    At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff, as an invitee on Defendant’s premises, to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or make safe dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (duty to invitees); Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (foundational duty principles); see also Massachusetts authorities construing occupier liability and duties owed to invitees.

14.    Defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance and supervision of the premises, including but not limited to:
       a. permitting a hazardous accumulation of water and ice to remain on a tile walkway for a time sufficient to create a hazard to invitees;
       b. failing to warn patrons and staff of the dangerous condition by placing visible warnings, cones, or signs indicating a wet/slippery floor;
       c. failing to take timely corrective action, such as removing the water and ice or cordoning off the area, after broken glass and spilled water were created by the dropped tray;
       d. failing to institute or follow adequate policies, procedures, or training for prompt remediation of spills in the high-traffic hallway between the kitchen and dining room.

15.    Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition. Plaintiff’s observation that staff had been "dodging that puddle," and the server’s statement that she would "be right back with a mop," reasonably demonstrate that Defendant’s employees knew or should have known of the dangerous condition and had time to correct it but did not.

16.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining injury, pain, suffering, medical expenses, lost earnings, and other damages.

17.    Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused by Defendant’s negligence and not by any negligence or fault of Plaintiff.

GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES

18.    Plaintiff relies upon the general principles of negligence and premises liability under Massachusetts law. Occupiers of land owe invitees a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a safe condition and to warn of dangerous conditions known to the occupier that are not obvious to the invitee. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343; Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; see also generally Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause principles).

19.    Notice may be established by evidence of actual knowledge, or by proof that the dangerous condition existed for such time that the occupier, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it (constructive notice). See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343; Massachusetts caselaw and treatises addressing constructive notice and the standard of care owed to invitees.

20.    Plaintiff timely files this action within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions under Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (three-year limitation period for personal injury actions).

21.    Plaintiff also intends to rely on applicable Massachusetts procedural authorities including Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (short and plain statement of the claim), Mass. R. Civ. P. 10(a) (caption), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (signing of pleadings).

DAMAGES

22.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:
       a. medical and related expenses in an amount of approximately $1,500.00 to date (special damages);
       b. lost wages in an amount of approximately $2,000.00 to date (special damages);
       c. pain, suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages (general damages), the nature and extent of which will be established at trial;
       d. any future medical expenses, lost earnings, and other damages that may be proven at trial;
       e. costs of suit and interest as allowed by law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A.     Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount sufficient to fully compensate her for past and future medical expenses, lost wages, loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other recoverable damages according to proof at trial;

B.     Award Plaintiff her special damages of approximately $1,500.00 in medical expenses and approximately $2,000.00 in lost wages (subject to amendment as additional expenses and losses are established);

C.     Award costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems fair and just; and

D.     Award such further relief as the Court deems equitable and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
