COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE (Personal Injury)

INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), pro se, brings this action against Defendant Thomas Richards (“Defendant”) for negligence arising out of personal injuries Plaintiff sustained when a large, visibly cracked branch from a maple tree located in front of Defendant’s property at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts fell and struck Plaintiff on July 15, 2023.

PARTIES

2. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

3. Defendant Thomas Richards is the owner and occupant of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201, where the incident described below occurred. On information and belief, Defendant is a resident of Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts and the Defendant resides and/or conducts activity in Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire Superior Court because the cause of action arose in Berkshire County (the incident location: 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff frequently walks along Maple Street in Pittsfield for recreation and to run errands. On or before July 15, 2023, Plaintiff regularly used the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s property.

7. In front of Defendant’s house at 123 Maple Street there is a large, mature maple tree with a major branch extending over the public sidewalk.

8. For a long period prior to July 15, 2023, Plaintiff and neighbors observed that a major branch of that maple tree was cracked, droopy, and visibly compromised. Neighbors informed Defendant of the cracked branch and suggested that he have the tree inspected by an arborist or otherwise addressed the hazard.

9. Defendant acknowledged such concerns to neighbors and stated he would “deal with it in the spring,” but Defendant did not have the tree inspected, did not remove or secure the cracked branch, and did not otherwise repair or mitigate the hazard.

10. On July 15, 2023, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm (no extreme weather conditions or tornado warnings), the already-cracked branch suddenly and without warning separated from the tree and fell onto the public sidewalk.

11. As Plaintiff was walking on the sidewalk past 123 Maple Street carrying grocery bags, the branch struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and upper back, knocked Plaintiff to the ground, and caused immediate pain and injury.

12. As a proximate result of the falling branch, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises. Plaintiff sought and received medical treatment for her injuries and incurred medical expenses of approximately $3,500. Plaintiff also missed approximately one week of work from her retail job and lost approximately $600 in wages.

13. Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the falling branch which resulted from Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, or otherwise correct a known and obvious hazardous condition on or at the edge of his property overhanging the public sidewalk.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed a duty to others using the public sidewalk adjacent to his property, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of trees and branches on his property that posed a foreseeable risk of harm to passersby. This duty encompassed inspecting, removing, trimming, securing, or otherwise reasonably addressing hazardous branches that could fall and injure persons on the sidewalk.

16. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and inspecting the maple tree and its major branch overhanging the sidewalk. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that a large major branch was cracked, droopy, and at risk of falling. Defendant further breached his duty by failing to take available remedial measures, such as having an arborist inspect the tree, trimming or removing the dangerous branch, or otherwise warning pedestrians or closing off the sidewalk.

17. Defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. The fall of the cracked branch was a foreseeable consequence of failing to inspect and remedy a visibly cracked major branch hanging over a public walkway.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injury including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises; incurred medical expenses of approximately $3,500; lost wages of approximately $600; endured pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses in an amount sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for all medical care reasonably related to the incident (approximately $3,500 to date and continuing);

B. Compensatory damages for past and future lost wages in an amount sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for income lost as a result of her injuries (approximately $600 to date and continuing);

C. Damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic losses in an amount to be determined at trial;

D. Costs of suit, prejudgment and post-judgment interest to the extent allowed by law; and

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

- Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) — foreseeability and proximate cause principles.
- Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decisions addressing duty and premises liability (Plaintiff will rely on relevant SJC and Appeals Court authority at trial to the extent applicable to maintenance of trees, foreseeability of harm from hazardous branches, and the obligation of landowners to take reasonable precautions).
