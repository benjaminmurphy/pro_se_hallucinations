COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
HAMPDEN COUNTY
SUPERIOR COURT

Jennifer Lee,
    Plaintiff

v.                                                   C.A. No. _________________

Mark Thompson,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jennifer Lee is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual residing in Springfield, Massachusetts, who at all times relevant to this Complaint lived next door to Plaintiff and shared a driveway with Plaintiff at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on March 15, 2023 at or near the shared driveway at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because it is a civil action for personal property damage and economic loss arising from negligence and is properly brought in the Hampden County Superior Court. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1 and related venue statutes because the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Hampden County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 4 as if fully set forth herein.

6. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who reside in a duplex at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway and area where vehicles are parked.

7. Defendant owned a tall aluminum extension ladder. From time to time prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant left that ladder stored outdoors, leaning vertically against the wooden fence that runs along the side of the shared driveway, immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s normal parking area.

8. On at least two occasions before March 15, 2023, Plaintiff informed Defendant that she was concerned the ladder might fall onto her parked car, particularly on windy days. Plaintiff specifically requested that Defendant secure, tie down, or otherwise move the ladder away from the parking area. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would tie the ladder down or move it, but he failed to do so.

9. On or about March 15, 2023, during a period of gusty wind, Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the shared driveway at 123 Elm Street when a gust of wind caused Defendant’s unsecured aluminum extension ladder to tip and fall from its position against the wooden fence.

10. The ladder fell onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking the hood and the windshield. The hood was dented and the windshield cracked. Plaintiff’s vehicle remained operable, but sustained property damage requiring bodywork and a new windshield.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions (as alleged below), Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses including her auto insurance deductible and the cost of renting a replacement vehicle while her car was repaired for more than one week. Plaintiff has no significant medical expenses and did not suffer lost wages as a result of the incident.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise ordinary care to prevent foreseeable harm to Plaintiff and her property. Under Massachusetts law, a person who undertakes to store or place potentially hazardous items in a shared residential area owes a duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent those items from causing foreseeable harm to others (including taking steps such as moving, securing, or otherwise making safe potentially dangerous items).

14. Defendant breached his duty of care by, among other things, negligently leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder unsecured and leaning adjacent to the Plaintiff’s parking area; failing to take reasonable measures to secure, tie down, or otherwise make the ladder safe after Plaintiff warned him of the hazard; and failing to remove the ladder from a location where it could reasonably be expected to fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle.

15. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate and foreseeable cause of the ladder falling onto Plaintiff’s automobile during gusty wind conditions. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position would have foreseen the risk of damage to Plaintiff’s property from an unsecured ladder stored adjacent to the driveway, particularly after express notice from the Plaintiff.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: (a) cost of repairing and restoring her vehicle’s hood and windshield; (b) payment of insurance deductible; (c) cost of renting a replacement vehicle while her automobile was in the shop for repair for more than one week; (d) other out-of-pocket expenses and costs; and (e) interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to the cost of vehicle repairs, insurance deductible, rental car expenses, and other out-of-pocket losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence;

B. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. For costs of suit and attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts common law principles of negligence and related authorities, including but not limited to:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for actions of tort) and related provisions governing the commencement of actions in Massachusetts;
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 and ch. 223 (jurisdictional and venue provisions for civil actions);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282 (duty), § 287 (breach), § 281 (reasonable care), § 320 (risk created), and related Restatement provisions governing negligence and foreseeability;
- Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability and proximate cause principles);
- MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382 (1916) (duty principles);
- Cases from Massachusetts courts recognizing duty, breach, foreseeability, and proximate causation principles in negligence actions (see, e.g., decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court applying the foregoing standards in analogous premises and property-damage contexts);
- Authorities addressing the owner/possessor duty to secure or reasonably store potentially hazardous objects so as not to create an unreasonable risk to neighbors or others lawfully using adjacent property.

(For purposes of trial and pre-trial proceedings, Plaintiff intends to rely upon controlling Massachusetts statutes, SJC and Appeals Court jurisprudence, and secondary authorities such as the Restatement (Second) of Torts to establish Defendant’s duty, breach, causation, and Plaintiff’s damages.)

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays for judgment against Defendant as set forth above.

Respectfully submitted,
