COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Michael Thompson ("Plaintiff"), and for his Complaint against Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Michael Thompson is an adult resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff can be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store is a retail business that does business in Lowell, Massachusetts and at all times relevant was the owner, lessee, operator and/or occupier of the retail premises located at 123 Main St, Lowell, MA 01851 (the "Premises").

3. The events giving rise to this Complaint occurred on September 15, 2023 at the Premises in Lowell, Massachusetts.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Middlesex Superior Court, Lowell Division, because the claims arose in Lowell, Massachusetts and the Defendant conducts business and maintains the Premises in Middlesex County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on the Premises, shopping for household/kitchen goods.

6. Defendant maintained merchandise—large, heavy boxes of appliances—stacked on shelving in the store aisles. The stacks on certain shelving units were five to six boxes high. There were no visible straps, barriers, guardrails, restraining devices or other safety measures in place to secure the stacked boxes.

7. While Plaintiff was standing in the aisle looking at kitchen items, another customer pushed a shopping cart down the aisle and made ordinary contact with a lower shelf (a normal, everyday bump). In response to that contact, a large appliance box (a toaster-oven box) dislodged from near the top of the stack and fell from the shelving.

8. The falling box struck Plaintiff, landing on his shoulder and the side of his head. Plaintiff immediately felt dizziness and a severe headache.

9. The store manager responded to the incident. The manager completed an incident report and offered Plaintiff a store coupon. Plaintiff accepted medical attention later that night.

10. That evening, Plaintiff sought care at a local emergency department. He was diagnosed with a mild concussion (closed head injury) and a shoulder strain. Plaintiff was advised to avoid activities that might exacerbate his injury and to follow up with outpatient care as needed.

11. As a result of his injuries, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses to date (including ER visit, diagnostic evaluation and treatment). Plaintiff also lost approximately $800 in earnings as a delivery driver due to missed work arising from the injuries and related recovery.

12. Plaintiff also suffered physical pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of activities (including being unable to play in his weekly soccer league for about one month), emotional distress, inconvenience, and other economic and non-economic damages.

13. Defendant knew or should have known that stacking large, heavy boxes at unsafe heights without adequate restraining measures created an unreasonable risk of harm to invitees. Defendant failed to exercise ordinary care in storing and securing heavy merchandise, and failed to warn invitees of the hazard or to implement reasonable preventative measures (e.g., lower stacking height, straps, barriers, shelf lips, employee monitoring, signage, or safer storage practices).

14. The manager’s completion of an incident report and offer of a coupon after injury does not absolve Defendant of liability for the negligence that caused Plaintiff’s injuries.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(NEGLIGENCE — Duty, Breach, Causation, and Damages)

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a safe condition for business invitees, including a duty to store merchandise in a safe manner, to warn of dangerous conditions that Defendant knew or should have known about, and to take reasonable steps to inspect for and correct hazardous conditions.

17. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things:
    a. negligently stacking heavy appliance boxes unsafely high without straps, guards, or other means to restrain the boxes;
    b. failing to adopt, follow, or enforce reasonable store policies and procedures for safe stacking and storage of heavy merchandise; and
    c. failing to warn invitees and patrons, including Plaintiff, of the hazardous condition or to take other steps to eliminate or mitigate the risk.

18. Defendant's breach of its duties was the direct and proximate cause of the falling box striking Plaintiff and causing his injuries, including the mild concussion and shoulder strain, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other damages.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the injuries and damages described above, including but not limited to:
    a. past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (approximately $1,200 incurred to date);
    b. past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity (approximately $800 lost wages to date);
    c. past and future physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;
    d. costs of suit; and
    e. such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW (Representative Authorities)

20. The elements of a negligence claim under Massachusetts law are duty, breach, causation, and damages. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 281; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (liability for dangerous conditions on land); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (liability for negligent conduct). Massachusetts courts routinely apply these principles to premises liability claims brought by business invitees against store proprietors.

21. Massachusetts statutory and case law recognize the duty of landowners and occupiers to exercise reasonable care for invitees. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 (general provisions governing civil actions) and the body of Massachusetts common law on premises liability and negligence. (Plaintiff will rely on applicable Massachusetts authorities, including SJC and Appeals Court decisions interpreting landlord and occupier duties in premises cases, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts, in support of this claim at trial and in pretrial motions.)

[Note: The foregoing paragraph states the applicable legal standards under Massachusetts tort law and the Restatement; Plaintiff intends to rely on pertinent Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions applying these principles in the presentation of his case.]

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses (approximately $1,200 incurred to date), past and future lost earnings (approximately $800 lost to date), pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. For prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. For the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Michael Thompson

- Verify and cite precise Massachusetts statutes and controlling Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court authorities relevant to premises liability and invitee duty in any memorandum of law or motions; the Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343 and 343A provide core doctrinal support and are frequently cited by Massachusetts courts on these issues.
- Attach relevant medical records, incident report (if available), wage documentation, and any photos or witness statements to support damages and causation at the appropriate stage of litigation.
