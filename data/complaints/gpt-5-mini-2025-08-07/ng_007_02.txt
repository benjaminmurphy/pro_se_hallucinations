    Defendant.                                )

1. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1.1 Plaintiff Kyle Johnson ("Plaintiff" or "Mr. Johnson") is an adult resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s mailing address for purposes of this complaint is c/o 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, MA 02302. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 or by e-mail at psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant Brockton Community Center ("Defendant" or "Community Center") is a municipal/non-profit community center (as represented to the public) that operates premises and programs located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302. Defendant conducted an after‑school program at that location at all relevant times.

1.3 This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction because this is a civil action for personal injury occurring in Brockton, Massachusetts and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

1.4 Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, MA 02302 and the Defendant’s operations and the injury complained of are located in Brockton.

2. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

2.1 On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son was attending an after‑school program sponsored and supervised by Defendant at the Community Center’s gymnasium located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, MA (the “Premises”).

2.2 Defendant advertised and represented to program participants and their parents that children in the after‑school program would be supervised at all times while on the Premises—specifically in the gymnasium area.

2.3 On the date in question, the after‑school program was scheduled to be staffed by two (2) adult staff members to supervise approximately twenty (20) children. One staff member left the gym to do paperwork in the office, leaving only one staff member present in the gym.

2.4 The sole staff member who remained in the gym was primarily looking at her cell phone near the bleachers and was not actively supervising the children’s activities on the hardwood floor as required by the supervision policy and common standards of care for after‑school youth programs.

2.5 Two older boys, approximately twelve (12) years of age, began playing a rough tackle game on the gym floor. Several younger children, including Plaintiff’s son, were present on the floor with the older boys.

2.6 A few children informed the lone staff member that the older boys were playing roughly and engaging in tackling. The staff member dismissed the report and said, “boys will be boys,” and did not take steps to separate the larger older boys from smaller children, did not stop the rough activity, and did not resume active supervision.

2.7 As a result of Defendant’s inadequate supervision and failure to enforce safety rules, one of the older boys forcibly tackled Plaintiff’s eight‑year‑old son, who is small for his age. The tackle caused the child to strike his head on the hardwood floor and lose consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

2.8 Following the incident, Plaintiff’s son was transported to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,500.00 in medical expenses to date. Plaintiff’s son missed several days of school and continues to suffer effects related to the concussion.

2.9 At all relevant times, Defendant owed the children in its care, including Plaintiff’s son, a duty to exercise reasonable care, to properly staff and supervise the children in its after‑school program, to enforce safety rules, and to maintain reasonably safe premises and activities.

2.10 Defendant breached its duties by, among other things: (a) failing to provide the advertised and necessary number of competent adult supervisors; (b) permitting a staff member to be inattentive and primarily using a cell phone; (c) failing to intervene to stop dangerous rough play among children; (d) failing to separate older, larger children from younger, smaller children during rough play; and (e) failing to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable injury to children under its care.

2.11 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s son suffered physical injury (concussion), conscious pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical and related out-of-pocket expenses (approximately $5,500.00 to date), and other damages.

3. CAUSE OF ACTION
COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

3.1 Plaintiff incorporates the allegations in Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.11 as if fully set forth herein.

3.2 At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to protect program participants, including the children in its after‑school program, from unreasonable risks of harm arising from the activities Defendant sponsored and supervised. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§283–285 (duty to protect against physical harm from affirmative conduct); see also Massachusetts law recognizing the duty of reasonable care generally, and to supervise where one has custody of children.

3.3 The specific duties of reasonable care owed by Defendant included: (a) providing sufficient, competent supervision of children in its after‑school program; (b) actively supervising children during physical activity in the gym; (c) enforcing rules that prohibit dangerous rough play; (d) intervening to stop foreseeable dangerous conduct; and (e) ensuring the safety of the Premises and activities offered.

3.4 Defendant breached these duties by failing to provide adequate supervision; by permitting an employee to be inattentive and using a cell phone while responsible for supervising children; by dismissing children’s reports of dangerous conduct; by failing to stop foreseeable rough play; and by otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care.

3.5 Defendant’s breaches were a proximate and foreseeable cause of the injuries to Plaintiff’s son. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position should have foreseen that leaving one inattentive staff member responsible for twenty children engaged in active play could result in serious injury, particularly given the mix of younger and older children and the known potential for rough play to escalate into dangerous contact.

3.6 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s son sustained physical injury (concussion), incurred medical expenses (approximately $5,500.00), experienced pain and suffering and emotional distress, lost time from school, and suffered other damages for which Plaintiff seeks recovery.

4. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

4.1 This action is timely filed within the applicable statutory limitations period. Under Massachusetts law, the statute of limitations for personal injury actions is set by Massachusetts General Laws. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (describing limitation period for certain tort actions). The injury occurred on September 15, 2023, and this complaint is filed well within the applicable limitations period.

5. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

a) For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other consequential damages;

b) For interest, costs, and expenses of suit, including costs permitted under statute or court rule;

c) For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

6. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
