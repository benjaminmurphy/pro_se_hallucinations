COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Contract/Common Law — Massachusetts)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Thompson”) is an individual residing at 123 Ashmont Street, Apartment [Two‑Bedroom], Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02124. Plaintiff may be contacted by telephone at (617) 555‑0123 and by e‑mail at psm1433@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant Mark Reynolds (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the residential rental property located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124, where Plaintiff rents a two‑bedroom apartment.

1.3 Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy agreement under which Plaintiff took possession of the apartment beginning June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,800.00.

1.4 Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186 and the rules governing summary civil matters and landlord/tenant matters in the Boston Municipal Court, because the subject property is located in Dorchester and the cause of action arises from Defendant’s acts and omissions affecting Plaintiff’s tenancy in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The amount in controversy (damages claimed) is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court (Plaintiff seeks $600.00 in compensatory damages).

2. Nature of Action
2.1 This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law arising from Defendant’s repeated failures to provide consistently adequate heat during the 2024–2025 heating season, despite notice and limited attempted repairs, which substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, increased Plaintiff’s expenses, and caused personal injury and lost wages.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1 Plaintiff leased the two‑bedroom apartment at 123 Ashmont Street beginning June 1, 2022. Rent is $1,800 per month, paid to Defendant.

3.2 During the winter of 2024–2025 (including the months of December 2024 through March 2025), Plaintiff experienced repeated and substantial heat deficiencies in the apartment. The temperature in the apartment would periodically drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for periods of hours at a time, typically in the evenings, making the apartment uncomfortably cold and impairing Plaintiff’s normal use and enjoyment of the premises.

3.3 Plaintiff notified Defendant of the inadequate heat. Defendant arranged for repairs on two separate occasions. On the first occasion a repairperson attended and represented that the problem had been fixed; heat improved for approximately one week but the problem recurred. On the second occasion a repairperson inspected the heating system and described the boiler as “old but functional,” advising that there was not much more to do.

3.4 Despite these two repair visits, the problem repeatedly recurred and was not effectively remedied. The intermittent and recurrent nature of the heat failures meant that Plaintiff could not rely on the premises to be comfortably habitable and could not fully use her apartment in the normal manner.

3.5 Because the central heat was intermittently inadequate, Plaintiff purchased and used two electric space heaters to keep her apartment tolerably warm. The additional heating costs increased Plaintiff’s electric bills by approximately $150.00 per month for multiple months.

3.6 As a direct result of the persistent cold in the apartment, Plaintiff developed bronchitis in January 2025. Plaintiff’s treating physician advised that the cold indoor air likely exacerbated or contributed to Plaintiff’s respiratory condition. Plaintiff missed three days of work due to the illness and incurred costs for medical treatment and prescription antibiotics.

3.7 Defendant has taken the position that the heat is “working” on the basis that the heat never completely failed (i.e., the system never shut down entirely) and that the building was not frozen. Defendant nevertheless failed to provide functioning heat in a manner sufficient to allow Plaintiff the reasonable and expected use and enjoyment of the premises during the winter months.

3.8 The ongoing inadequate heating and Defendant’s failure to effect timely and adequate repairs, or otherwise provide habitable premises, substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the leased premises, forced Plaintiff to incur additional living expenses and medical costs, and caused lost wages.

4. Legal Basis — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
4.1 The lease between Plaintiff and Defendant (whether expressed or implied) includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s actions or omissions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the rented premises may constitute breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See generally M.G.L. c. 186; see also Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 12.1–12.3 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment); and relevant Massachusetts authorities addressing landlord obligations and tenant remedy.

4.2 The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and other applicable standards recognize heating as an essential service for safe and habitable housing. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation and Housing Code); M.G.L. c. 111 (public health) (authorizing sanitary code regulations and standards regarding heat and premises habitability). A landlord’s failure to provide adequate heat consistent with sanitary and housing standards can form the basis for a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the result is a substantial interference with tenancy.

4.3 Where, as here, a landlord has notice of inadequate heating and the condition continues despite attempted repairs and persists in a manner that substantially interferes with the tenant’s use of the premises, the landlord is liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s conduct — inadequate repair efforts, failure to replace or adequately repair the aging boiler, and refusal to recognize and rectify the recurrent deprivation of adequate heat — constitutes a breach of the covenant.

4.4 Plaintiff asserts that the relevant facts and law permit recovery of damages for out‑of‑pocket expenses (including increased utility bills and medical expenses), lost wages, and other consequential damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for the actual harm suffered.

5. Damages
5.1 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:
- Additional electric bills incurred for use of two space heaters, approximately $150 per month for the months reasonably attributable to the heating deficiency (Plaintiff estimates total extra electricity of $450 for three months of the worst heating deficiency period);
- Medical expenses and prescription costs related to bronchitis exacerbated by cold indoor air (amounts paid by Plaintiff: approximately $100);
- Lost wages for three days of missed work (approximate lost wages: $50);
- General discomfort, inconvenience, and loss of the full benefit of the tenancy.

5.2 Plaintiff believes that the appropriate compensatory damages for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment are approximately $600.00 (exclusive of any court costs, service fees, pre‑ and post‑judgment interest, and fees awarded by statute or court rule).

6. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:
a) Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for compensatory damages in the amount of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), or such other amount as the Court finds just and proper;
b) Costs of suit and filing fees;
c) Pre‑ and post‑judgment interest as permitted by law;
d) Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

7. Applicable Authorities (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Authorities)
Plaintiff relies upon and cites the following Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and authorities in support of the legal claim set forth above (representative, non‑exhaustive list):

Statutes and Regulations
- M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statute; general landlord/tenant law and contract law principles applicable to residential tenancies).
- M.G.L. c. 111 (Public Health), including authority to adopt sanitary regulations affecting habitability.
- M.G.L. c. 239 (Summary Process and action jurisdiction generally).
- M.G.L. c. 93A (Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act) — cited as a background source recognizing landlord obligations to tenants in some contexts (though Plaintiff brings only a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment claim here).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code / Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) — including provisions addressing heating/temperature standards for residential dwellings and landlord responsibilities to provide adequate heat.
- 105 CMR 410.100–410.200 (provisions addressing environmental standards, heating requirements, and tenant safety and habitability standards).
- Local housing regulations and codes applicable in the City of Boston (housing and building codes) — as relevant to landlord obligations and habitability.

Representive Massachusetts Authorities and Treatises (recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment, implied warranty of habitability and landlord obligations; Plaintiff cites these authorities for legal principles applicable to the claim):
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 12.1–12.3 (Implied covenant of quiet enjoyment).
- Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions recognizing or applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations in residential tenancies (see, e.g., decisions discussing implied covenants, substantially interfering landlord conduct, and remedies available to tenants: see authorities generally collected in Massachusetts landlord/tenant practice and the Massachusetts Appeals Court and SJC jurisprudence; Plaintiff will rely on controlling decisions of the SJC and Appeals Court addressing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties in residential settings).
- Massachusetts housing and landlord–tenant practice treatises and appellate decisions interpreting M.G.L. c. 186 and 105 CMR 410.000 (including decisions addressing repairs, essential services like heat, and tenant remedies).

(Notes: Plaintiff intends to rely upon and will identify specific controlling Massachusetts cases and excerpts from the state’s appellate jurisprudence and local housing code regulations at or before trial or in briefing as may be required by the Court. Plaintiff respectfully requests leave to cite additional specific cases and to supplement authorities in accordance with the Court’s rules.)

8. Demand for Jury Trial
8.1 Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment against Defendant in the amount of $600.00, together with costs, interest, and such further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
