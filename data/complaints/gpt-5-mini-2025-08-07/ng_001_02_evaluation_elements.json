    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant is owner/occupier of the store and that Plaintiff was an invitee on the Premises (\u00b6\u00b61.2, 2.1). It expressly pleads the possessor-of-land duty to invitees and cites Restatement \u00a7343 and Massachusetts law (\u00b6\u00b63.2\u20133.3). Those factual and legal allegations adequately establish a duty of care."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a large puddle of milk in the dairy aisle with no warnings or barriers (\u00b6\u00b62.2\u20132.3) and that an employee saw the spill a few minutes earlier but delayed cleanup (\u00b62.4). Paragraph 3.4 lists specific failures (no cleanup, no inspections, no warnings, inadequate policies). These facts adequately plead a breach of the asserted duty."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Plaintiff alleges she stepped into the puddle and fell, resulting in a hip injury (\u00b6\u00b62.2, 2.5\u20132.6). Those allegations sufficiently plead that but for the spilled milk and Defendant\u2019s failure to remediate/warn, the fall and resulting injury would not have occurred."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges the hazardous condition (spilled milk) foreseeably creates a slip hazard for invitees and that Defendant\u2019s breaches foreseeably caused Plaintiff\u2019s fall and injuries (\u00b6\u00b63.5\u20133.6). The employee\u2019s awareness of the spill strengthens foreseeability/notice allegations (\u00b62.4)."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific medical diagnosis and treatment (hip sprain, physical therapy) and quantifies medical expenses (~$2,000) and lost wages (~$1,500), along with pain and suffering and other damages (\u00b6\u00b62.6\u20132.7, 3.6). These allegations sufficiently plead actual damages."
