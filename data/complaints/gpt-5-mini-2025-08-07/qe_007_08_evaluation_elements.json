  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Allegations identify Plaintiff as the tenant of record who rents the Premises and pays rent ($2,200/mo) and identify Defendant as the owner/landlord (\u00b6\u00b61\u20132, 4). These factual allegations sufficiently establish a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges affirmative conduct and omissions by Defendant: commencement/permitting of renovations in the adjacent unit, ongoing construction activity, and failure to mitigate (\u00b6\u00b65\u20136, 9\u201310, 13, 15). Those allegations adequately plead an act or omission by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges sustained daily audible construction noise (drilling, hammering, loud worker conversations) during weekday work hours, and intrusion of dust/particulate into the unit, which have substantially interfered with Plaintiff\u2019s ability to use the Premises for working from home and normal residential use (\u00b6\u00b66\u20138, 13\u201314). These factual allegations sufficiently plead a non-de minimis, substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint ties the interference directly to Defendant\u2019s renovations and related failures to mitigate\u2014asserting that the construction and dust from the adjacent unit permitted/caused the noise and air-quality problems (\u00b6\u00b65\u20136, 8, 13, 15, 17). Those factual allegations adequately plead causation between the landlord\u2019s conduct and the interference."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Plaintiff alleges economic and other damages resulting from the interference, including diminution in value of use, loss of use, interference with work and employment, and seeks an amount to be proven (estimated $2,000) (\u00b616). Those allegations sufficiently plead damages."
