Docket No. ___________

JESSICA THOMPSON,
    Plaintiff

v.

MARK RIVERA,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Mother") is an individual and resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is phone (617) 555-0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Mark Rivera ("Defendant" or "Father") is the other parent of the minor child and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Massachusetts General Laws governing domestic relations and child custody and the authority of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and parenting time orders.

2. Caption/Case History
2.1 On or about May 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order providing that Plaintiff have primary physical custody of the parties’ son, Ethan Thompson (born 2017? The parties agree Ethan is currently eight years old), and awarding Defendant three brief visits during the week and Sunday afternoons, with no overnights.
2.2 The current order remains in effect and is the order sought to be modified.

3. Child(ren)
3.1 The minor child subject to this action is:
    - Ethan Thompson, age 8.

4. Nature of Action / Requested Relief
4.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint for Modification seeking a modification of the current custody/parenting time schedule to reflect a material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the Court (1) permit regular overnight parenting time at the Father’s home and (2) adopt a revised parenting time schedule that reduces frequent short school-night exchanges, provides predictable overnight time consistent with Ethan’s age, and otherwise serves Ethan’s best interests as he advances in school.

5. Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 Since entry of the May 15, 2019 order, a material change in circumstances has occurred that warrants modification:
    a. Housing: At the time of the 2019 order, Defendant only had a room in a shared apartment and lacked adequate private sleeping space for a child, which the Court relied upon in denying overnights. Defendant now resides in his own apartment and has a separate bedroom available for Ethan. That housing change was not contemplated at the time of the prior order.
    b. Age and Development of the Child: Ethan is now eight years old and in full-time elementary school. His developmental needs and requests have changed since age three, and he has repeatedly expressed a desire to have overnight stays at his Father’s home.
    c. Practical Parenting Time Concerns: The existing schedule involves multiple brief visits on school nights and a Sunday afternoon visit. These frequent short exchanges disrupt Ethan’s homework, bedtime routine, and overall stability and are no longer suited to his age and school schedule.
    d. Mutual Agreement on Change: Both parents agree that the present schedule is not appropriate to Ethan’s age and schooling and that a schedule allowing overnight parenting time and reducing short school-night visits would be better for Ethan’s stability and well-being.
5.2 These changes (housing, age, schooling, and the negative practical effects of short-weekday visits) constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2019 order.

6. Best Interests of the Child
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, the best interests of the child is the guiding principle for custody and parenting time decisions. Plaintiff submits that a modification to permit regular overnights at Father’s home, together with a schedule that reduces frequent short school-night transfers, is in Ethan’s best interests because:
    a. It will provide more predictable, age-appropriate time with Father, responding to Ethan’s wishes and promoting parental bonding;
    b. It will reduce child fatigue and improve compliance with homework and bedtime routines by minimizing short nighttime transfers during the school week;
    c. Defendant’s present housing conditions provide adequate space, privacy, and safety for overnight parenting time; and
    d. Both parents are willing to cooperate to implement a plan that serves Ethan’s stability, schooling needs, and emotional development.

7. Proposed Modified Order (Requested Relief)
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the May 15, 2019 custody/parenting time order as follows:
7.1 Findings: Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order and that modification is in the best interests of the minor child.
7.2 Parenting Time/Overnights: Permit Defendant reasonable overnight parenting time as follows (or in the alternative, grant such other schedule as the Court deems appropriate in the child’s best interests):
    a. Regular schedule: Every other weekend from Friday after school or 5:00 p.m. until Sunday at 6:00 p.m. (with return to Plaintiff in time for Sunday evening routine and preparation for school);
    b. Midweek overnight: One weekday overnight per week (e.g., Wednesday after school until Thursday morning) during the academic term to reduce short school-night transfers;
    c. Holidays, school vacations, and summer schedule: Parenting time and overnight allocation to be determined according to a standard holiday/summer rotation consistent with the child’s schooling and best interests (or by reference to the Court’s usual holiday schedule practices);
7.3 Transportation: Modify the transportation provisions to minimize unnecessary school-night transfers and to allocate pick-up/drop-off responsibilities equitably between the parents, or as the Court deems appropriate to reduce disruption to Ethan’s school and bedtime routines.
7.4 Any other relief the Court deems just and proper to protect the child’s best interests and to effectuate an orderly transition to a schedule that includes overnights.

8. Legal Basis
8.1 This action is brought pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting time orders where there has been a material change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.
8.2 Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts statutes and applicable caselaw addressing modification of custody and parenting time, including but not limited to:
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory authority for custody determinations and modifications);
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act) (jurisdictional matters, if relevant);
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 and other statutes as applicable regarding child welfare and best interests considerations;
    - Cases addressing the material-change standard and best-interests analysis, including (by way of example and guidance) Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions interpreting custody-modification standards and the importance of child stability, parental fitness, and changed circumstances (see, e.g., cases discussing the material-change standard and the analytical framework applied by Massachusetts courts).
8.3 Plaintiff intends to rely at hearing on the foregoing provisions and case law governing modification of custody and parenting time, including on matters of housing, the child’s developmental needs, school functioning, and the welfare of the child.

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Court:
9.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the prior order of May 15, 2019;
9.2 Modify the custody/parenting time order to permit regular overnight parenting time for Defendant and adopt the revised schedule described above (or such other schedule as the Court finds in the child’s best interests);
9.3 Modify transportation and logistical provisions to minimize school-night transfers and protect the child’s school and bedtime routine;
9.4 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

10. Certification of Good Faith
10.1 Plaintiff certifies that this Complaint is filed in good faith and that she will seek to confer with Defendant in good faith and to attempt to minimize litigation by proposing reasonable accommodations for parenting time consistent with the child’s best interests.

Date: December 1, 2025

Notes and suggested next steps (for filing and hearing preparation)
- Complete the docket number and any missing contact/address for Defendant before filing.
- Prepare an affidavit in support of the Complaint describing in detail the changed housing circumstances, the child’s age and schooling, examples of how the present schedule disrupts homework/bedtime, and the parents’ agreement that the schedule should change.
- Bring any documentation of Defendant’s housing (e.g., lease showing separate bedroom), school records, or other relevant evidence to the hearing.
- Consider proposing a specific parenting plan attachment to the Complaint setting out week-by-week, holiday, and vacation schedules, transportation arrangements, and a dispute-resolution mechanism to minimize future litigation.

Legal authorities commonly relied upon in Massachusetts custody modification proceedings (examples for counsel/court reference)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory authority for divorce, custody, and related orders)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children and youth provisions as applicable)
- Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure (applicable local practice and procedure)
- SJC/Appeals Court jurisprudence interpreting the material change standard and best-interests analysis (see, e.g., leading Massachusetts decisions addressing modification standards and the “material change in circumstances” requirement and the focus on the best interests of the child). Counsel and the Court routinely consult these authorities when examining changes in housing, parental fitness, child maturity, schooling impacts, and the reasonableness of visitation/overnight adjustments.

(If you would like, I can draft a detailed affidavit in support of this Complaint, a specific parenting plan attachment with holiday/summer schedules, and a proposed order for the Court to sign.)
