JESSICA LANGFORD,

v.

MARK SILVERMAN,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — Dorchester, MA)

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

1. Plaintiff Jessica Langford (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Ms. Langford”) brings this action against her landlord Mark Silverman (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Landlord”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the leased premises located at 55 E. Wareham St., Apt. __, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”), under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks actual damages, costs, interest and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff is an individual residing at 55 E. Wareham St., Dorchester, MA 02124 and may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

3. Defendant Mark Silverman is the owner and landlord of the Premises and at all relevant times was responsible for maintenance, repair, and habitability of the Premises.

4. Plaintiff began renting the Premises on or about July 1, 2022 under a periodic/monthly tenancy for which she pays rent in the amount of $2,200.00 per month.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because this is an action arising out of a landlord-tenant relationship concerning residential premises located in Boston (Dorchester). Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Dorchester and the cause of action arose there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. During the winter of 2024–2025 (and continuing intermittently thereafter), the heating system serving the Premises repeatedly failed to maintain a reasonably habitable indoor temperature. While the heat did not go completely out, it would drop to approximately 60°F for several hours—usually in the evenings—creating cold, uncomfortable, and potentially unsafe living conditions.

7. Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant of the recurring inadequate heating. Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on at least two occasions to address the heating problem.

8. After the first repair visit the heating improved for about one week, but the problem soon recurred.

9. At the second repair visit the repair person characterized the boiler as “old but functional” and indicated that there was not much else to do. The intermittent significant drops in temperature, however, continued after that visit.

10. In response to the inadequate heating, and to keep the Premises reasonably habitable, Plaintiff purchased two electric space heaters. The use of those space heaters materially increased Plaintiff’s electricity usage and electric bills by approximately $150.00 per month during the affected months.

11. In January 2025 Plaintiff developed bronchitis. Her treating physician concluded that the cold indoor air likely contributed to or exacerbated her respiratory condition. Plaintiff missed three days of work due to the illness and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics and related medical co-payments.

12. Defendant has taken the position that the heat is “working” because it never goes completely off and because the building is not freezing; he has therefore declined to provide a permanent repair or to make meaningful remedial efforts to ensure consistent, adequate heat.

13. The Premises’ intermittent but prolonged drops in heating and the Landlord’s failure to provide adequate heating, despite knowledge and repeated requests for repair, substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and rendered the dwelling uncomfortable and unsafe at times during the winter months.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. At all times relevant hereto, the Defendant, as landlord, owed Plaintiff the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and a duty to provide and maintain premises in a habitable condition consistent with residential use, and to refrain from actions or omissions that substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied covenant in residential tenancies recognized and enforced under Massachusetts law and common law principles. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment as protecting tenants from conditions substantially interfering with residential use); see also Massachusetts statutory and regulatory standards for housing habitability and heating set forth in M.G.L. c. 111, the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.), and other landlord-tenant authorities.

17. Defendant’s repeated failures to ensure consistent, adequate heating despite notice (including two repair visits that did not cure the problem) and continued interruptions of heat that caused indoor temperatures to fall to approximately 60°F for hours at a time unreasonably and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

18. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment because the frequent, prolonged cold conditions and failure to fully and durably remediate the heating problem deprived Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises for ordinary residential purposes during the affected periods.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:
    a. Increased electricity expenses of approximately $150.00 per month for space heaters (for the affected months) — damages claimed in the total amount included in paragraph 21 below;
    b. Out-of-pocket medical expenses and lost wages related to the bronchitis and related care (including missed work for three days and antibiotic costs);
    c. General inconvenience, discomfort, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; and
    d. Other economic losses and expenses reasonably related to the recurring heating failure.

20. Plaintiff exhausted any informal remedies required for the claim (by notifying Defendant and allowing reasonable opportunity for repair), and gave Defendant notice and opportunity to cure the heating problem; notwithstanding this, Defendant failed to provide consistent satisfactory heating.

21. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff seeks actual damages in the total amount of $1,200.00, which represents the presently claimed compensatory damages for increased electric bills, medical costs, lost wages and other measurable expenses attributable to the breaches alleged herein. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend and/or supplement the amount of damages sought should further evidence of damages become available prior to trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of at least $1,200.00 (or such greater amount as proven at trial) for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. Awarding Plaintiff costs, pre- and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law, and any other relief the Court deems appropriate;

C. Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

TRIAL BY JURY

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
