It articulates a general negligence standard and burden of proof, not a specific duty concerning storage, securing, or maintenance of property so as not to create risks to neighbors. Thus it is too contextually different to be proper authority for the specific duty described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn using this term, ordinary care, it may be proper to state, that what constitutes ordinary care will vary with the circumstances of cases. In general, it means that kind and degree of care, which prudent and cautious men would use, such as is required by the exigency of the case, and such as is necessary to guard against probable danger. \u2026 If\u2026 the defendant was doing a lawful act, and unintentionally hit and hurt the plaintiff, then unless it also appears\u2026 that the defendant is chargeable with some fault, negligence, carelessness, or want of prudence, the plaintiff\u2026 is not entitled to recover.\u201d"

Instead, Cardozo\u2019s opinion holds that there was no actionable negligence toward the plaintiff because she was outside the range of reasonably foreseeable risk, and expressly states that questions of proximate cause are \u201cforeign to the case\u201d once no duty is found. The case is frequently cited to limit liability based on duty and foreseeability, not to establish that negligence was the direct and proximate cause of particular property damage.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort\u2026 Here, by concession, there was nothing in the situation to suggest to the most cautious mind that the parcel wrapped in newspaper would spread wreckage through the station.\u201d"
