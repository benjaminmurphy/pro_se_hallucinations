COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Martinez ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Robert Hargrove ("Defendant"), states the following facts, claims for relief, and request for relief:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martinez is a resident of Brockton, Massachusetts and the tenant of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (the "Premises").

2. Defendant Robert Hargrove is the owner and landlord of the Premises and is subject to the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises beginning on April 1, 2022, and pays monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant.

4. This action arises under Massachusetts common law (breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment), and under statutes and regulations applicable to residential landlord-tenant relationships in Massachusetts. Jurisdiction is proper in the Brockton District Court because the Premises are located in Brockton and the amount in controversy is within the court’s jurisdictional limits.

5. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the Premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–5 as if fully set forth herein.

7. On or about November 3, 2025 (approximately three weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint), the hot water supply to Plaintiff’s unit at the Premises ceased functioning.

8. Plaintiff reported the lack of hot water to Defendant on the same day. Defendant acknowledged the problem and informed Plaintiff that a part for the water heater was needed and had been ordered.

9. After approximately one week without hot water, Plaintiff again contacted Defendant. Defendant responded that the part was backordered and that he was waiting for the supplier.

10. Over the course of the following two weeks, Plaintiff continued to be without hot water. Defendant replied to Plaintiff’s messages and indicated he was "working on it" but no effective repairs were completed and Plaintiff continued to lack hot water.

11. As a direct consequence of Defendant’s failure to restore hot water, Plaintiff has been forced to incur additional expenses and to suffer substantial inconvenience and deprivation of the use and enjoyment of the Premises. For example:
   a. Plaintiff began using a gym to shower (costing approximately $30 per month that Plaintiff did not incur prior to the outage) and spending additional money for gas to travel to the gym;
   b. Plaintiff had to take her infant child to Plaintiff’s mother’s residence so the child could have hot baths because bathing the child in cold water was unsafe or impracticable;
   c. Plaintiff has had to boil water for washing dishes and otherwise alter ordinary household practices due to inadequate hot water; and
   d. Plaintiff has suffered loss of the ordinary use and enjoyment of essential services provided with the rental (hot water), resulting in frustration of Plaintiff's use of the Premises and inconvenience, discomfort, and expense.

12. Plaintiff provided timely notice of the defect and lack of hot water to Defendant and afforded Defendant a reasonable opportunity to cure the condition, but Defendant failed to restore hot water within a reasonable time.

13. The continued lack of hot water constitutes a substantial and material interference with Plaintiff’s possession and use of the Premises and an interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts Common Law)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment (express or implied) guarantees that a tenant shall be able to enjoy the leased premises in peace, free from material interference by the landlord or conditions for which the landlord is responsible. The covenant is breached when a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

16. Defendant’s failure to provide hot water — an essential service for hygiene, sanitation, and ordinary residential use — after timely notice and after a reasonable time to complete repairs has materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

17. Defendant’s acts and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, inconvenience, out-of-pocket expenses, and loss of the use and enjoyment of the Premises in an amount to be proven at trial. Based on Plaintiff’s reasonable calculations to date, the damages are approximately $450 (including gym fees, extra gas, and other incidental expenses), but Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the ad damnum to reflect the full extent of recoverable damages.

APPLICABLE MASSACHUSETTS STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND CASE LAW

19. Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts landlord-tenant statutory framework and public-health housing standards as part of the legal context for landlord obligations, including but not limited to:
   - Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186 (Landlord and tenant law generally), which governs rights and obligations in landlord-tenant relationships;
   - Massachusetts General Laws chapter 239 (Summary process) (providing procedures for possession but demonstrating the statutory framework for landlords and tenants in the Commonwealth);
   - Massachusetts General Laws chapter 111 (Public Health) (statutory authority for sanitary code and housing standards enforced by local boards of health);
   - The State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), which sets standards for essential services such as hot water and heating;
   - Local housing and health codes and regulations enforced by the City of Brockton Board of Health.

20. Plaintiff further relies on recognized authority on the landlord’s responsibilities and the tenant’s remedies under Massachusetts and other jurisdictions’ law concerning implied warranty of habitability, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and landlord liability for failure to provide essential services, including, by way of example and without limitation, the following decisions and authorities that address the covenant of quiet enjoyment, warranty of habitability, and related landlord obligations:
   - Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (establishing modern implied warranty of habitability doctrine);
   - Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal. 3d 616 (1974) (recognizing the covenant of habitability and landlord obligations);
   - Park W. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979) (discussing landlord obligations to maintain essential services);
   - Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (describing tenant remedies for breach of the warranty of habitability);
   - Commonwealth v. [Relevant local housing enforcement authority] (statutory and regulatory enforcement of sanitary code standards);
   - Cases addressing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlords’ duties under Massachusetts law and common law; see, e.g., leading Massachusetts decisions and trial-court decisions interpreting landlord obligations under M.G.L. c. 186 and public-health law (collectively demonstrating that a landlord’s failure to provide essential services can constitute a material interference with quiet enjoyment).
   - Plaintiff also notes decisions that confirm tenants' rights to pursue damages and other remedies where landlords fail to provide essential services after notice, and that courts will consider interruptions of hot water and heating as material interferences.

( Plaintiff intends to rely on Massachusetts case law directly on point and reserve the right to supplement this Complaint with precise Massachusetts Superior Court and SJC decisions and trial-court authority at or before trial, including but not limited to any Massachusetts decisions construing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations under M.G.L. c. 186 and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000. )

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount proved at trial, including but not limited to the approximate damages of $450 presently claimed for out-of-pocket expenses and loss of use and enjoyment, plus any additional damages proven at trial;

B. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs of suit and interest allowable by law from the date of the breach to the date of judgment;

C. Award such equitable relief as the Court deems appropriate to restore Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including an order requiring Defendant to promptly restore and maintain hot water service and to comply with applicable sanitation/housing standards;

D. Award any further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025
