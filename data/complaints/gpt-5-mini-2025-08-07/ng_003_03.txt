    Plaintiff

v.                                                    Civil Action No. ___________

Home Goods Emporium, Inc.,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

The Plaintiff, Marcus Johnson, by way of Complaint against the Defendant, Home Goods Emporium, Inc., alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Marcus Johnson ("Plaintiff" or "Mr. Johnson") is a resident of Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Home Goods Emporium, Inc. ("Defendant" or "Home Goods Emporium") is a corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and operating a retail discount home-goods store at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, leased and/or maintained the premises located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (the "Premises").

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court, Lowell Division, because the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Middlesex County, at the Lowell store location.

4. This action is commenced within all applicable statutes of limitation, including without limitation M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (governing actions for personal injury).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at approximately [time not known to Plaintiff], Plaintiff was a lawful invitee on the Premises of Defendant located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff was lawfully in the aisle examining kitchen goods for sale.

6. At the time and place described above, Defendant stored heavy boxed appliances on shelving units in the aisle. The boxes were stacked high (approximately five to six boxes high) and were not secured by straps, guards, barriers, netting, shelf lips, or other reasonable restraints to prevent boxes from falling from upper shelves onto customers below.

7. Another customer was proceeding down the same aisle in a shopping cart. That customer bumped a lower shelf, a normal incidental contact in a retail store aisle. The bump was not forceful or extraordinary.

8. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's failure to properly secure heavy boxed merchandise on high shelving, a large boxed toaster-oven fell from near the top of the shelving and struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of his head.

9. Plaintiff felt immediate dizziness and a severe headache. The manager at the store came to the scene, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon. Plaintiff accepted neither admission of fault nor full remediation at that time.

10. Later that night, Plaintiff's symptoms worsened. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment and was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain. Plaintiff received medical care and treatment for these injuries and incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,500.

11. As a result of the injuries sustained in the incident, Plaintiff missed several days of work as a delivery driver and lost approximately $800 in wages. Plaintiff was also unable to play in his weekly community soccer league for approximately one month, and he suffered physical pain, mental anguish, inconvenience, disability, and impairment of his ability to enjoy life.

12. All of the foregoing injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of Defendant in the operation, maintenance, control, stocking, supervision, and safety of the Premises, as further alleged below.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(NEGLIGENCE)

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed Plaintiff, and all other lawful invitees, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, stocking, supervision, control, and operation of its premises so as to keep the premises free from hazards and to warn of dangerous conditions which were known or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have been known.

15. Defendant breached its duty of care to Plaintiff by, among other acts and omissions:
    a. Failing to secure heavy boxed merchandise stacked on high shelving with appropriate restraints, barriers, guards, lips, netting, or other reasonably necessary measures to prevent boxes from falling onto customers below;
    b. Failing to design, maintain, inspect, and supervise the shelving and stacking practices in a reasonably safe manner for invitees;
    c. Allowing heavy boxed appliances to be stacked at unsafe heights without appropriate restraints or warnings;
    d. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable stocking, display, and safety procedures to protect customers from foreseeable harm; and
    e. Otherwise failing to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent retailer would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.

16. Defendant's negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, damages and losses, including but not limited to physical injury (mild concussion and shoulder strain), medical expenses (approx. $1,500), lost wages (approx. $800), pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other economic and non-economic damages to be established at trial.

17. The harm to Plaintiff was foreseeable to Defendant. Retail businesses that stack heavy merchandise at unsafe heights without securing the merchandise create a foreseeable risk that boxes will fall and strike customers below. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable precautions against that foreseeable risk constitutes negligence and a breach of the duty owed to invitees.

APPLICABLE LAW

18. Plaintiff pleads and relies upon Massachusetts negligence law and principles established by the Massachusetts courts and recognized authorities, including but not limited to the duty of a possessor of land to exercise reasonable care for the safety of invitees (see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 and § 343A), and Massachusetts authorities recognizing the general negligence standard of ordinary care (see Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (5 Cush.) 292 (1850)). See also established tort principles as articulated in Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability as an element of proximate cause), MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382 (1916) (duty of care to avoid foreseeable risk), and other controlling authorities cited by Massachusetts courts.

19. Plaintiff further pleads and relies upon the Massachusetts statute of limitations applicable to personal injury actions, M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A, and principles of apportionment and comparative fault recognized in Massachusetts (see M.G.L. c. 231, § 85). Plaintiff also relies upon Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, including Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (general statement of claim), and controlling Massachusetts caselaw on premises liability and negligence.

20. By way of non-exhaustive illustration of relevant authority, Plaintiff cites and will rely on the following authorities in support of the legal theories and elements of negligence pleaded herein:
    - Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (5 Cush.) 292 (1850) (ordinary care standard);
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land to invitees) and § 343A;
    - Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability and proximate cause principles);
    - MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382 (1916) (duty to prevent foreseeable injury);
    - M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury);
    - M.G.L. c. 231, § 85 (apportionment/comparative fault principles);
    - Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (pleading standard);
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (liability for physical harm caused by condition on land);
    - Authorities and Massachusetts precedent addressing merchant and occupier liability to invitees for hazardous conditions and negligent maintenance or display of merchandise (including, without limitation, premises-liability decisions and negligence decisions cited in Massachusetts case law);
    - Any other Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing standard of care, foreseeability, proximate cause, and damages for personal injury in premises-liability contexts.

( Plaintiff will rely on the foregoing authorities and additional relevant Massachusetts case law at trial and in support of motions and other proceedings. )

    c. Pain and suffering, mental anguish, physical impairment, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial; and
