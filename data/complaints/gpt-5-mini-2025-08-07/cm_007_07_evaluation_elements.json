      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete factual changes since the 2018 Order: the Defendant\u2019s progressive neurological diagnosis, declining mobility and balance, multiple falls, physician advice against being left alone with a child in certain situations, and instances where the child was required to assist the Defendant\u2014facts that, if proven, constitute a material and substantial change affecting the child\u2019s welfare."

    "best_interests_of_child": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint ties the requested modification to the child\u2019s safety and welfare, alleging that unrestricted alternating-week custody now places the child at risk and imposes inappropriate caregiving duties; it seeks remedies tailored to protect the child (primary residence with Plaintiff, supervised/supportive parenting time, medical evaluations), which are pleaded as necessary for the child\u2019s best interests."
