Hilder clearly recognizes and adopts an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases and discusses widespread modern acceptance of that doctrine, but it does not contain a clear statement that \"jurisdictions uniformly recognize obligations\" in any broad, generic sense. Because the claimed proposition is not a well-defined legal principle traceable to a specific holding or passage, the opinion cannot be said to support it as stated.",

This warranty of habitability is implied in tenancies for a specific period or at will."
