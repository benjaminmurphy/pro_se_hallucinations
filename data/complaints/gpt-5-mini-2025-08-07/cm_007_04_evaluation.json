The plurality, concurrence, and Thomas\u2019s opinion all root the decision in substantive due process protection for parental rights, making the case a leading authority on constitutional parental rights and limits on state interference with parental decisions.",

The Court then uses that parental liberty interest to hold that heightened procedural protections (a clear and convincing evidence standard) are required before the State may permanently terminate parental rights. That directly supports citing Santosky for \u201cparental liberty interest principles.\u201d",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe absence of dispute reflected this Court\u2019s historical recognition that freedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \u2026 The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. \u2026 When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d"
