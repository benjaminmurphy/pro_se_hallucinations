COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, MA)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez ("Plaintiff" or "Tenant") is an individual and a tenant residing at 45 Washington Ave, Unit ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant John Smith ("Defendant" or "Landlord") is the owner/landlord of the premises at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, Massachusetts and may be served at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, MA (or at such other address as appears on Defendant’s rental records).

3. Plaintiff began renting the subject apartment on or about January 15, 2022, under a month-to-month tenancy for which Plaintiff pays $1,450.00 per month in rent.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court because the rental premises are located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this claim occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 4 above as if fully set forth herein.

6. During the last several months, the main entry door to the building at 45 Washington Ave has had a broken lock that does not latch properly, allowing the door to be pushed open without a key.

7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the broken lock approximately two months ago (on or about October 1, 2025). Defendant acknowledged the problem and told Plaintiff he would fix the lock. No meaningful repairs were made thereafter.

8. Plaintiff reminded Defendant about the broken lock on two subsequent occasions (on or about October 20, 2025 and November 5, 2025). Defendant did not timely repair or adequately secure the main entry.

9. In late November 2025, an unknown person entered the building and went through tenants’ mail and packages in the hallway. Several tenants, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the common hallway.

10. Plaintiff lost a package valued at approximately $120.00 as a direct result of the unauthorized entry into the building and the unsecured main entry door.

11. Plaintiff has observed evidence that someone has been sleeping in the building basement, including personal items and bedding, which indicates unauthorized access to common areas and creates an on-going safety and security risk for tenants.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair the building entry door and otherwise secure the premises, Plaintiff reasonably feared for her personal safety and the safety of her property.

13. To mitigate the immediate risk to her safety and property, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera directed toward her apartment door and purchased and installed a higher-quality deadbolt for her own apartment door. These reasonable security measures cost Plaintiff approximately $200.00 in out-of-pocket expenses.

14. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns as “overreacting” and stated that the neighborhood was safe, despite the building’s unsecured entry and the known incidents of unauthorized entry and theft.

15. Defendant’s conduct — his failure to repair or secure the common entry door after notice and his failure to take reasonable steps to protect tenants from foreseeable intrusions — substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rented premises and the common areas, and materially impaired Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of $320.00 (comprised of $120.00 for the stolen package and $200.00 in security-related expenditures), plus any other damages to be proved at trial, together with costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts common law)

17. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 above as if fully set forth herein.

18. Under Massachusetts common law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is part of every residential lease and tenancy. The covenant of quiet enjoyment obligates the landlord to ensure that the tenant may possess and enjoy the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or third parties when such interference is caused or facilitated by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See authorities cited below.

19. Defendant, by failing to repair the building’s main entry lock and by failing to take reasonable steps to secure common areas after actual notice of the defective lock and after repeated tenant complaints, materially breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

20. Defendant’s omission was willful or negligent and created foreseeable risks of intrusion, theft, and danger to tenants. The unauthorized entrants’ access to the building and theft of Plaintiff’s package directly flowed from Defendant’s failure to repair and secure the common entry.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered actual, compensable damages in the amount of $320.00 and continues to suffer diminished use and enjoyment, fear for personal safety, and emotional distress. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in the amount of $320.00 (for the stolen package and reasonable security-related expenditures), together with any additional damages proved at trial;

B. For costs of suit and reasonable statutory interest from the date of loss;

C. For such equitable and declaratory relief as the Court deems appropriate to secure the building and to enforce Landlord’s obligations to provide secure access to the premises (including an order requiring Defendant to repair or replace the main entry lock, to secure common areas, and to take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access); and

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

ATTORNEY’S FEES
22. Plaintiff requests an award of reasonable attorney’s fees only to the extent they are available under applicable law and statute. (Plaintiff is proceeding pro se for purposes of this filing; Plaintiff reserves the right to seek attorneys’ fees if counsel is retained and if authorized by statute or court rule.)

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
23. Plaintiff demands a jury trial on all issues so triable.
