Robert Smith,

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint against Defendant Robert Smith alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Johnson”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Robert Smith (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605, and is the landlord from whom Plaintiff rented the apartment beginning June 1, 2020.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction because the subject premises is located in Worcester County and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185A and the court’s venue rules because the rented premises and Defendant are located in Worcester.

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limit of this Court. Plaintiff seeks $280 in compensatory damages plus costs, pre-judgment interest, and other relief as set forth below.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff has rented the residential apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA from Defendant since June 1, 2020, pursuant to a month-to-month written or oral tenancy. Plaintiff pays Defendant $1,200.00 per month in rent.

6. Beginning approximately three months prior to the date of this complaint Plaintiff began to notice mouse droppings in the kitchen of her apartment on a recurring basis.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation and requested adequate measures to eliminate the rodents and restore a habitable and peaceful use of the premises.

8. In response, Defendant placed a few snap traps in the kitchen. Two mice were reportedly caught. Defendant thereafter told Plaintiff that mice and droppings are “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff should keep the kitchen cleaner.

9. Plaintiff keeps the kitchen clean and reasonably sanitary; she had cleaned and secured food but continued to find mouse droppings weekly despite her efforts.

10. Defendant arranged for a single visit by an exterminator. The exterminator told Plaintiff that the building required a more comprehensive (repeat and building-wide) extermination program to address the infestation effectively.

11. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for follow-up or comprehensive extermination, stating such treatment was “overkill” and too expensive, and declined to take further action to abate the infestation.

12. Because of the infestation and repeated droppings Plaintiff has been compelled to discard approximately $200.00 worth of food (opened or packaged items that could not be safely consumed) and to purchase plastic food storage containers at a cost of approximately $80.00.

13. The recurrent presence of mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s comfortable, safe, and quiet use and enjoyment of the leased premises. Plaintiff is anxious about cooking and eating in her own kitchen and has suffered inconvenience, loss of use of parts of the premises, and monetary loss as described above.

14. Defendant’s inadequate and insufficient response to the known rodent infestation, despite notice from Plaintiff and confirmation by an exterminator that comprehensive treatment was required, constitutes a continuing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (MASSACHUSETTS)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord implicitly warrants the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and must take reasonable steps to maintain the premises in a condition fit for habitation and to abate conditions that materially interfere with tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); Marini v. Ireland, 373 Mass. 1 (1977) (recognizing landlord duties regarding habitability and tenants’ remedies); Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (establishing the modern doctrine linking habitability and tenants’ remedies); see also Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (discussing habitability and remedies).

17. The presence of rodents and repeated rodent droppings in a tenant’s kitchen constitutes a substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises and with habitability and sanitary living conditions. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000; see also Javins, supra; Marini, supra.

18. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation and Plaintiff’s complaints, including the exterminator’s professional advice that a more comprehensive treatment was required to abate the infestation.

19. Despite notice and the opportunity to correct the condition, Defendant failed and refused to take reasonable or adequate remedial action (such as repeat or building-wide professional extermination), thereby materially interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and safe use of the premises.

20. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy and a violation of applicable habitability standards and the landlord’s statutory and common-law duties to maintain the premises in a reasonably fit and habitable condition.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to the cost of spoiled food ($200.00), the cost of necessary food storage containers ($80.00), loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, inconvenience, and other consequential damages. Plaintiff’s reasonable and provable economic damages total approximately $280.00, and she seeks recovery of these sums together with court costs and other relief below.

Notes and Helpful Practical Points (for Plaintiff’s use only):
- The complaint above pleads breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as the sole claim, and requests modest compensatory damages ($280.00) for out-of-pocket losses. You should bring to court supporting documentation (receipts for food and containers, photos of droppings if available, any written communications with the landlord, the exterminator’s report or summary, and a log of dates you observed droppings and reported them).
- If you later decide to pursue additional statutory or common-law claims (e.g., violations of 105 CMR 410.000 or M.G.L. ch. 111 public health regulations, or statutory remedies), you may need to amend the complaint or file additional counts; the present document contains the single requested claim only.
