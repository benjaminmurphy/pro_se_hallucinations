COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Only claim: Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts law)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maria Gonzales (“Plaintiff” or “Tenant”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

2. Defendant Steven Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603, where Plaintiff resides pursuant to a written lease beginning June 1, 2022.

3. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law because the premises are located in Worcester and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Worcester. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to the Massachusetts venue rules for actions arising in that judicial district.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a lease for the residential apartment at 123 Maple Street on or about June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant.

5. Beginning approximately three months prior to the date of this Complaint (i.e., beginning approximately September 2025), Plaintiff began discovering mouse droppings in her kitchen on a recurring basis.

6. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the presence of mice and mouse droppings and requested that the infestation be addressed.

7. Defendant responded by placing a few snap traps in the unit. Two mice were captured, but the droppings continued to appear on a weekly basis after Defendant’s limited measures.

8. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that rodent activity is “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff needed to keep the kitchen cleaner. Plaintiff maintains the kitchen in a clean and sanitary condition and has taken reasonable precautions to keep food and trash secured. Defendant’s statements and response were insulting and did not address the infestation.

9. Defendant engaged a licensed exterminator for a single visit only. The exterminator informed Plaintiff (and reported to Defendant) that the building required more comprehensive and repeated treatment to abate the infestation and eliminate conditions that were attracting rodents.

10. Defendant declined to authorize or pay for the comprehensive (repeat and building-wide) treatment recommended by the exterminator, stating that such treatment was “overkill” and too expensive.

11. As a result of the ongoing rodent infestation, Plaintiff has been forced to discard food in boxes and bags that was exposed to contamination by rodent droppings, causing out-of-pocket food losses of approximately $200.00. Plaintiff also purchased plastic, rodent-proof food storage containers at a cost of approximately $80.00 to prevent further contamination.

12. Plaintiff has suffered ongoing stress, anxiety, and loss of use and enjoyment of her kitchen and home because she reasonably fears that cooking or eating food prepared in or stored in the kitchen will expose her or her household to contamination by rodents.

13. Despite repeated requests by Plaintiff that Defendant take reasonable and effective measures to abate the rodent infestation, Defendant has failed and refused to do so. Defendant’s refusal to take appropriate remedial action has caused and continues to cause a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her leased premises.

14. Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to resolve the matter with Defendant, but Defendant refuses to take the necessary actions recommended by the exterminator or to otherwise eliminate the ongoing infestation.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

15. Massachusetts law recognizes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential leases, which requires the landlord to refrain from actions or omissions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See generally Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the relationship between habitability and covenant of quiet enjoyment and widely cited in Massachusetts courts); see also Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (recognizing the landlord’s implied warranty of habitability and remedy for substantial interference).

16. The Commonwealth’s sanitary and housing standards—set forth in the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.)—require that dwelling units be maintained free of vermin and rodent infestations and that landlords take reasonable steps to abate infestations when they affect habitability. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.; see also M.G.L. c. 111 (Public Health) (statutory public health responsibilities and authority to address conditions detrimental to health); M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (statutory framework governing landlord and tenant obligations).

17. Massachusetts courts and other authorities have held that persistent infestations of vermin or rodents that substantially interfere with a tenant’s reasonable use of the premises may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or the implied warranty of habitability, entitling the tenant to damages and/or equitable relief. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (housing code violations and habitability linked to landlord obligations); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (implied warranty of habitability and remedies); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (remedies for habitability violations); Park West Management Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979) (landlord duties and tenant remedies); see also cases recognizing tenant remedies where landlords fail to remedy infestations or other habitability issues that substantially interfere with quiet enjoyment.

18. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s persistent failure to remedy conditions that result in a substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may entitle the tenant to damages for actual losses, diminution in rental value, and other relief. See Javins, supra; see generally M.G.L. c. 186; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

19. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.

20. The lease between Plaintiff and Defendant contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

21. Defendant has committed a substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises by failing to take reasonable and effective steps to abate the ongoing rodent infestation despite knowledge of the condition and repeated requests for remediation.

22. Defendant’s conduct—specifically, limiting remedial measures to a few traps, a single exterminator visit, refusing to follow the exterminator’s recommendation for comprehensive treatment of the building, and blaming Plaintiff’s housekeeping rather than addressing the infestation—constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual economic loss in the form of food discarded due to contamination (approx. $200.00) and purchases of protective food storage containers (approx. $80.00), and has suffered emotional distress, loss of use and enjoyment of her home, anxiety, and inconvenience.

24. Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to resolve the infestation through notice and requests for remedial action but Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable steps to abate the infestation, thereby necessitating this action.

25. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages caused by Defendant’s breach, together with costs, pre-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including an order compelling Defendant to take necessary and reasonable measures to abate the infestation and make the premises fit for their intended residential use.
