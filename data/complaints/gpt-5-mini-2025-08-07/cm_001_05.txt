Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Smith, and hereby files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody/parenting schedule entered on April 15, 2021, and in support thereof alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Rachel Smith is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant James Smith is an individual believed to reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of two minor children: Emily Smith, born in 2017 (age 8), and Noah Smith, born in 2019 (age 6) (collectively, “the children”).

4. This Court entered the existing custody and parenting-time order on April 15, 2021 (the “Existing Order”), awarding primary physical custody to Plaintiff with Parenting Time to Defendant consisting of alternate weekends and one overnight during the week.

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s general jurisdiction over custody, modification and related relief.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At the time the Existing Order was entered, both parents worked regular daytime schedules and the existing parenting time arrangement was reasonably suited to the parties’ respective work schedules and the children’s needs.

7. Since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant accepted a new work schedule that regularly requires him to work overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. on several nights per week, including frequently on nights when the Existing Order provides Defendant with overnight parenting time.

8. On numerous occasions in the past months and continuing to the present, Defendant has failed to be awake, attentive, or otherwise reasonably available to provide care to the children during the overnight parenting time awarded by the Existing Order because of his overnight work and sleep schedule. The children have reported that Defendant naps upon returning from work and that they often fall asleep on the couch while he naps.

9. Defendant has frequently left the children in the care of his roommate or has dropped the children at Plaintiff’s residence with little or no advance notice, stating he is “too tired” following his overnight shifts to care for them. Plaintiff has limited familiarity with and has not vetted the roommate as a child caregiver.

10. Defendant’s recent conduct and work schedule have resulted in: (a) unexpected and repeated disruptions to the children’s routines and to Plaintiff’s caregiving responsibilities; (b) increased stress and anxiety for the children; (c) occasions in which the children were left in the care of an unknown adult (the roommate) without Plaintiff’s consent; and (d) uncertainty regarding the children’s evening and overnight supervision and safety.

11. Plaintiff has attempted informally to address these concerns with Defendant and has requested that overnight parenting time occur only on nights when Defendant is actually off work and reasonably able to supervise the children, and that Defendant provide reasonable advance notice of any change in his availability and identify any alternate caregiver in advance. Defendant has not agreed to make such changes.

12. The changes in Defendant’s work schedule and the resultant inability and/or unwillingness of Defendant to reliably supervise and care for the children during court-ordered overnights constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order and affect the children’s welfare and best interests.

CLAIM FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME

13. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, modification of custody or parenting time requires a showing that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and that modification is in the best interests of the child. The changes alleged above satisfy that standard and the requested modifications are necessary to protect the children’s safety, welfare, stability, and best interests.

15. The facts here—Defendant’s regular overnight work schedule, Defendant’s repeated inability to remain awake and available during court-ordered overnights, Defendant’s repeated last-minute drop-offs, and placement of children with an unfamiliar roommate—demonstrate that the children’s care and supervision during legally ordered overnight parenting time is not occurring as intended by the Existing Order and that, unless the schedule is modified, the children will continue to experience instability and potential safety and welfare risks.

REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order of April 15, 2021 warranting modification of parenting time and custody provisions;

B. Modify the Existing Order to provide that Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when Defendant is not scheduled to work an overnight shift (i.e., on nights when Defendant is actually off work and reasonably available to care for the children without impairment from recent work); and that overnight parenting time scheduled for a night when Defendant is working or will be working an overnight shift shall be converted to either (i) an alternative daytime parenting time arrangement mutually agreed upon in advance, or (ii) makeup parenting time at a mutually agreeable time, subject to the Court’s final determination;

C. Order that Defendant must provide Plaintiff, at least 72 hours in advance (or, in emergency or unforeseeable circumstances, as soon as practicable), written or electronic notice of any change to his work schedule that will affect parenting time and identify any alternative caregiver in advance of leaving the children in such person’s care, including name, contact information, and relationship to the parties; Plaintiff reserves the right to object to any proposed alternate caregiver and seek Court review if necessary;

D. Enter temporary interim orders, if necessary, staying all unplanned overnights by Defendant unless Defendant provides proof (pay stubs, employer schedule, or other reliable documentation) that he is not scheduled to work and will be available to properly supervise the children for the entirety of overnight parenting time;

E. Require that Defendant maintain and provide to Plaintiff contact information for any person with whom the children will be staying and that Defendant produce evidence of the suitability of any alternate caregiver prior to leaving the children with such person, and that Defendant provide a reliable telephone contact while exercising parenting time;

F. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the children, including but not limited to allocation of counsel fees and costs, or appointment of a parenting coordinator or guardian ad litem if the Court deems such appointment appropriate.
