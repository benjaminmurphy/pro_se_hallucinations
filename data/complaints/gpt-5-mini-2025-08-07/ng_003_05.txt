COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, David Thompson, and complains against the Defendant, HomeGoods Discount Store, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff David Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an adult resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store (“Defendant”) is a retail business operating a discount home-goods store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

3. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred at Defendant’s store located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum for the Middlesex Superior Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, at approximately [during business hours], Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s store at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, as an invitee, for the purpose of shopping.

6. Defendant stored and displayed heavy boxed appliances and similar goods stacked approximately five to six boxes high on shelving located along the store aisles. The boxes were placed high on open shelving without adequate restraints, straps, barriers, or other reasonably available safety devices to prevent boxes from falling.

7. While Plaintiff was standing in an aisle looking at kitchen goods, another customer pushed a shopping cart down the aisle and bumped one of the lower shelves. The contact was minor — a routine bump consistent with ordinary shopping activity.

8. As a result of the bump to the lower shelf, a heavy boxed toaster-oven located near the top of the stack became dislodged, fell from the upper shelving, and struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of his head. The box’s fall was a direct and foreseeable consequence of the unsafe manner in which Defendant stacked and stored heavy merchandise.

9. Plaintiff immediately felt dizziness and a severe headache. The store manager came to the scene, filled out an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon. Plaintiff left the store but that evening his symptoms worsened.

10. Plaintiff sought emergency medical care at a local hospital the same day. The emergency room diagnosis was mild concussion (a traumatic brain injury) and shoulder strain. Plaintiff received conservative treatment, was advised to rest and refrain from certain activities, and incurred medical expenses in connection with the evaluation and treatment.

11. As a result of his injuries, Plaintiff suffered pain, disability, loss of enjoyment of life, and economic losses. Plaintiff works as a delivery driver and missed work for several days, resulting in lost wages. Plaintiff also was unable to participate in his weekly recreational soccer league for approximately one month.

12. As of the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff’s reasonable and verifiable medical expenses are approximately $1,200. Plaintiff’s lost wages total approximately $600. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend these amounts to reflect further medical treatment, lost earnings, future care, and other damages as discovered.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (SOLE CLAIM)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. At all times relevant to this action, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the inspection, maintenance, and safe configuration of its premises and to warn of or correct hazardous conditions of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343; see also Massachusetts law recognizing the duty owed to business invitees (collective citations and discussion below).

15. Defendant breached that duty by negligently storing heavy boxed merchandise stacked excessively high, failing to use reasonable safeguards (such as straps, barriers, placarding, or lower stacking), failing to secure heavy merchandise so that it would not be dislodged by ordinary activity in the aisle, failing to maintain its shelving and display practices in a reasonably safe manner, and failing to inspect and correct the hazardous condition within a reasonable time.

16. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the accident and of Plaintiff’s injuries, causing the boxed appliance to fall and strike Plaintiff, directly resulting in the concussion, shoulder strain, pain, suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages described above.

17. Defendant’s negligence and the hazardous conditions it created were foreseeable. A retail store that places heavy items high on open shelving without restraints should reasonably foresee that ordinary shopping activity, including bumping of lower shelving or carts, could dislodge an upper box and cause it to fall and injure a customer.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of duty, Plaintiff has sustained and continues to sustain injuries and damages, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, impairment of physical function, and loss of enjoyment of life, in amounts to be proven at trial.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

19. Plaintiff asserts liability under general principles of negligence and premises liability as applied in Massachusetts. The duty to exercise reasonable care to protect invitees from dangerous conditions is well-established in Massachusetts and articulated in relevant authorities, including but not limited to:

- Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (condition of land — duty to invitees);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §339 (dangerous instrumentalities);
- Striar v. Luso-American Hospital, 367 Mass. 167 (1975) (recognizing duty to invitees);
- Sullivan v. Boston & Maine R.R., 383 Mass. 765 (1981) (premises liability principles);
- Sullivan v. Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 392 Mass. 821 (1984) (duty and foreseeability);
- Foster v. American Oil Co., 356 Mass. 73 (1969) (storeroom/retail safety principles);
- Smith v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 21 Mass. App. Ct. 22 (1985) (retailer liability for customer injuries from merchandise);
- Demoulas Super Markets, Inc. v. City of Beverly, 425 Mass. 301 (1997) (business duties);
- Ramos v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 412 Mass. 703 (1992) (store negligence principles and foreseeability);
- Trowbridge v. Russell, 427 Mass. 213 (1998) (proximate cause and duty analysis).

(Notes: Plaintiff cites the Restatement and Massachusetts caselaw to establish recognized legal principles that commercial proprietors owe invitees a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain safe premises and to prevent reasonably foreseeable injuries from hazardous conditions. Plaintiff will rely on those authorities, and others, at trial to establish the Defendant’s duty, breach, causation, and damages.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store as follows:

A. Compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (approximately $1,200 in past medical expenses to date, subject to amendment);

B. Compensatory damages for past and future lost earnings and lost earning capacity (approximately $600 in lost wages to date, subject to amendment);

C. Compensatory damages for past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and physical impairment in an amount to be determined at trial;

D. Costs of suit, interest as allowed by law, and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Important note to the Court and parties: Plaintiff is proceeding pro se and reserves the right to amend the Complaint, to add parties or claims, to supplement the factual allegations and damages as additional discovery and medical records become available, and to rely on additional statutes, regulations, and case law appropriate to the issues raised. Plaintiff intends to introduce relevant Massachusetts caselaw and statutory authority at the appropriate time to support the negligence claim and the elements of duty, breach, causation, and damages.
