It rejects the old caveat lessee/constructive eviction framework, treats the lease as a contract with interdependent covenants of habitability and rent, and discusses landlord liability and tenant remedies. This directly supports citing the case as persuasive authority on the implied warranty of habitability and landlord obligations.",

This warranty of habitability is implied in tenancies for a specific period or at will\u2026 Additionally, the implied warranty of habitability covers all latent and patent defects in the essential facilities of the residential unit.\u201d"
