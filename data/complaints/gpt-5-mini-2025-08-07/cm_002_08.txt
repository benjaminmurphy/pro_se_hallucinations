Michael Johnson
(Respondent / Defendant)

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner. Sarah Thompson ("Petitioner"), mother of the minor child named below, is an adult resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Petitioner can be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Respondent. Michael Johnson ("Respondent"), father of the minor child, is an adult (last known residence in the Cambridge area; Respondent has announced an intended move to New Hampshire). Respondent is the other parent and party to the custody order referenced below.

1.3 Minor child. The subject of this action is the parties’ minor child:
- Emma Johnson, born [approx. 2017] (age 8) (the "Child").

1.4 Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA), and the general subject-matter jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and visitation orders entered by this Court in family matters.

2. Background / Existing Order
2.1 On May 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody/visitation order (the "Existing Order") awarding primary physical custody of Emma to Petitioner, with Respondent having parenting time consisting of midweek overnights on Wednesdays and alternating weekend parenting time ("Wednesdays and every other weekend").

2.2 The Existing Order was entered on the assumption that both parents resided in the Cambridge area, that the Child attended the local school, and that travel time between parents’ residences and the Child’s school and activities would be short.

3. Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, Respondent has informed Petitioner that he intends to relocate to New Hampshire for a new job opportunity and will seek to preserve the exact same visitation schedule (midweek overnight Wednesdays and every other weekend).

3.2 The anticipated relocation will substantially increase round-trip travel time for midweek visits to approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in traffic, which will require the Child to be driven midweek evenings to Respondent’s New Hampshire residence and then returned early the next morning to Cambridge to attend school.

3.3 The increased travel time and schedule would:
a) materially and adversely affect the Child’s ability to attend school on time, interfering with educational continuity;
b) cause the Child to miss after-school activities and extracurriculars, which are important to the Child’s social, developmental, and emotional well-being;
c) produce ongoing anxiety and stress for the Child related to long drives, early wake-ups, and interruptions to her routine; and
d) materially alter the logistics and burdens on the custodial parent (Petitioner), including health, safety, and daily care arrangements.

3.4 The foregoing constitutes a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order such that modification is warranted to protect the Child’s best interests and welfare.

4. Best Interests of the Child / Legal Standard
4.1 Petitioner alleges that modification of the Existing Order is necessary and appropriate under Massachusetts law governing custody modifications and the UCCJEA because (a) there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the Child; and (b) the proposed modifications requested below are in the Child’s best interests.

4.2 Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court consider all factors relevant to the Child’s best interests, including but not limited to: the Child’s health, safety and welfare; educational stability; the Child’s relationship with each parent; the Child’s developmental and psychological needs; the likely impact of transit time and schedule disruption; continuity of routine and extracurricular participation; and each parent’s ability to facilitate meaningful parent-child contact consistent with the Child’s best interests.

5. Facts Supporting Modification
5.1 The Child has begun to express anxiety and reluctance about the long drives required under Respondent’s proposed relocation-based schedule. The Child has missed or had to alter participation in after-school activities due to the travel and schedule imposed by the midweek parenting time.

5.2 The midweek overnight arrangement that previously worked when both parents lived locally will, if preserved after Respondent’s move to New Hampshire, force the Child into frequent long car rides, early-morning returns, chronic disruption to educational routine, and loss of participation in important social and school activities.

5.3 The burdens described above are likely to continue and increase if Respondent changes residence to New Hampshire while insisting on preserving the existing schedule. The cumulative effect will be detrimental to the Child’s physical and emotional well-being and educational progress.

6. Requested Relief / Proposed Modified Schedule
6.1 Petitioner requests that the Court enter a modified custody and parenting-time order replacing the midweek Wednesday overnight visitation with a different arrangement that reasonably accommodates the distance and the Child’s needs, while preserving meaningful access to Respondent. Specifically, Petitioner requests:

a) Immediate temporary relief (pending final hearing): suspend midweek overnight parenting time (Wednesdays) and prohibit any midweek overnight exchanges that require more than 45 minutes one-way travel; require exchanges to occur at a mutually convenient public location in the Cambridge area or at the Child’s school, at times that do not interfere with the Child’s school attendance or regular activities; and direct the parties to maintain communication regarding school activities and transportation needs;

b) Permanent modification: eliminate midweek overnights to Respondent’s New Hampshire residence and convert midweek contact to either (i) supervised or unsupervised early-evening drop-ins in the Cambridge area on a schedule to be determined by the Court, or (ii) virtual/phone contact on weeknights and/or two weeknight visits per month in the Cambridge area if logistics permit, and adjust weekend parenting time to a schedule that reduces frequency of very early morning returns and long single-day travel while providing additional longer weekend blocks for Respondent on alternating weekends that are workable considering the distance (for example, 1.5 weekends out of 2, or extended alternating weekends from Friday afternoon through Sunday evening, subject to school schedule constraints);

c) Require that any exchanges that will require the Child to miss school or to be returned after school start times be prohibited, except by Court order or jointly agreed written consent of both parties and the Child’s school; and

d) Award such other and further relief as the Court deems in the Child’s best interests, including but not limited to mediation, appointment of a parenting coordinator, or professional evaluation of the Child’s educational and psychological needs if the Court deems necessary.

6.2 Petitioner further requests that the Court retain jurisdiction to modify the parenting schedule as necessary to accommodate the Child’s best interests in light of any changed circumstances and order such other and further relief as justice requires.

7. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order dated May 15, 2021;
2. Modify the Existing Order to eliminate midweek overnight visitation in Respondent’s New Hampshire residence and otherwise adopt the modified parenting-time schedule and terms requested above, or such alternative schedule as the Court finds in the Child’s best interests;
3. Enter a temporary order suspending midweek overnights and prescribing interim exchange locations, times, and conditions pending a final hearing;
4. Order mediation, parenting coordination, or professional evaluations if the Court finds them appropriate;
5. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper; and
6. Award costs and fees to Petitioner as the Court may find appropriate.

Verification
I declare under the penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
