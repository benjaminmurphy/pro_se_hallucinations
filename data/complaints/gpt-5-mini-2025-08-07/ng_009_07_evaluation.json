Stevenson. In the quoted portion, Cardozo explicitly brackets off questions of proximate cause and focuses instead on the relational nature of duty and negligence\u2014concluding there was no duty to the plaintiff because she was outside the zone of foreseeable risk. The opinion actually says the law of proximate causation is \u2018foreign to the case,\u2019 so citing it specifically as a proximate causation analysis is also inaccurate in context.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort. We may assume, without deciding, that negligence, not at large or in the abstract, but in relation to the plaintiff, would entail liability for any and all consequences, however novel or extraordinary.\u201d"
