Since the proposition only repeats the case name followed by \u201c(duty of care)\u201d without any substantive statement, and no duty-of-care discussion appears in this excerpt, the case as presented does not support that labeled proposition.

Moran (sexual assault case), not a tort case involving the MBTA or a discussion of foreseeability. Nothing in this opinion addresses duty, breach, or foreseeability principles in negligence, so it cannot support a foreseeability proposition attributed to Hurley v. MBTA. The mismatch of case name, citation, and subject matter indicates the proposition is not supported by this text.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Because credibility was pivotal to the case, and because it can be inferred from the jury\u2019s acquittal of the defendant on the aggravated rape and rape charges, and their acquittal of the codefendant on all charges, that the jury did not fully credit the complainant\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the erroneous exclusion of the record requires a new trial."
