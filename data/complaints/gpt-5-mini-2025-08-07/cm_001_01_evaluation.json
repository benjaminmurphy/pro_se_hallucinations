The case deals with misrepresentation in a real estate transaction, expert testimony on environmental remediation costs, rescission, and payment of a money judgment into court. It therefore does not establish or discuss the material-change-plus-best-interests standard for custody modification under Massachusetts law, so citing it for that proposition is incorrect.",

However, since neither party has raised the issue, indeed they agreed to the process, we leave further discussion of this issue for another day."

General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 33A, provides that the sentencing judge must credit prisoners with time served in confinement prior to sentence, while awaiting trial. See also G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B. It has been frequently stated that these statutes are \u201cnot to be examined in an overly technical manner but [are] rather to be read \u2018against the backdrop of fair treatment of the prisoner.\u2019\u201d Commonwealth v.
