COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue

1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Wang ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Newton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant Michael Davidson ("Defendant") is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in or near Newton, Massachusetts, and may be served at his usual place of residence or wherever he may be found.

1.3 The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred at or near 30 Cole Ave, Newton, Massachusetts on or about June 15, 2023.

1.4 The amount in controversy in this action is within the jurisdictional limits of the Newton District Court. Venue is proper in this Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.

2. General Allegations / Facts

2.1 On June 15, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a public path in a park located at 30 Cole Ave, Newton, Massachusetts.

2.2 The park in which Plaintiff was jogging has posted signage requiring dogs to be kept on leashes.

2.3 Defendant is the owner and/or person in control of a large dog that Defendant regularly permits to run loose in that park despite the posted leash requirement.

2.4 On June 15, 2023, Defendant allowed his dog to be off-leash. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from the running path, talking with friends, and holding the dog’s leash over his shoulder but not attached to the dog.

2.5 As Plaintiff ran along the path, Defendant’s dog suddenly charged at her, barking loudly and aggressively, causing Plaintiff to fear an imminent dog attack.

2.6 In order to avoid being bitten or harmed by the dog, Plaintiff swerved off the park path. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped and fell over a tree root located along the edge of the path and fell down a small embankment.

2.7 As a proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a broken wrist. The dog did not actually make physical contact with Plaintiff; the injuries resulted from Plaintiff’s attempt to avoid the dog and from the fall caused by the uneven surface/tree root.

2.8 Defendant finally called the dog back after Plaintiff had already fallen.

2.9 Several other joggers and park users observed the incident and witnessed the dog charging and Plaintiff’s fall.

2.10 As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment at a local hospital emergency room, required a wrist brace for weeks, incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500, lost wages of approximately $1,200, and missed a piano recital for which she had been practicing.

3. Negligence: Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages

3.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 2.10 as if fully set forth herein.

3.2 At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully using the park, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, control, handling, and supervision of his dog, to keep the dog under control, and to comply with applicable leash laws and park rules.

3.3 Defendant breached his duty of care by, among other things:

- permitting and allowing his dog to be off-leash in a park that required leashes;
- failing to restrain, control, or supervise his dog;
- allowing his dog to run free where it a) could reasonably be expected to cause alarm to park users and b) could foreseeably create a risk of injury to those lawfully using the path; and
- failing to take reasonable steps to call or secure the dog when it charged at Plaintiff.

3.4 Defendant’s breach of duty was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Reasonable persons in Defendant’s position should have foreseen that permitting a large dog to run loose and charge park users would create a substantial risk that a jogger would take evasive action and thereby suffer injury.

3.5 As a direct and proximate result of defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injury and resulting pain and suffering, incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500, has suffered lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200, endured loss of enjoyment of life, and sustained other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial but believed to be in excess of the jurisdictional minimum of this Court.

4. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

4.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 3.5 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2 Defendant’s negligent, careless, and reckless conduct as set forth above constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law.

4.3 Defendant’s negligence proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages as set forth above.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff JESSICA WANG respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant MICHAEL DAVIDSON as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, past and future lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses;

B. Awarding prejudgment interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper;

C. Granting such further relief as this Court deems fair and equitable.

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Jessica Wang

AUTHORITIES (Select statutes, treatises, and cases commonly relied upon for negligence and owner liability for animals — for counsel or court citation; Plaintiff is proceeding pro se and provides these authorities as foundational legal support; Plaintiff requests parties and Court to consult current law and cite additional controlling authority as appropriate.)

Statutes and Rules (Massachusetts)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, §§ 155–157 (statutes regulating dogs and control; leash requirements and owner responsibilities).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 (general civil actions statutes; see applicable provisions governing tort actions and damages).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 60 (statute of limitations and related procedural provisions — verify applicable period for personal injury).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260 (statutes of limitation generally — Plaintiff asserts timely filing within applicable period).
- Mass. Rules of Civil Procedure (Mass. R. Civ. P.) — governing service, pleadings, and procedure in Massachusetts courts.

Treatises / Restatement
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518 (liability of one who keeps or harbors a wild animal — relevant for keeper liability); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 509 (one who supplies a dangerous instrumentality).
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302A–323 (duty to third persons, attractive nuisance and foreseeability principles) and §§ 286–314 (causation and proximate cause principles).

Representative Massachusetts and applicable common-law authorities on negligence and owner liability (illustrative; Plaintiff requests the Court and counsel cite controlling authorities and updates):
- Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause and foreseeability principles) (widely cited for proximate cause analysis).
- Prosser, Keeton on Torts (general tort principles on duty and breach).
- Relevant Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) opinions on negligence and proximate cause addressing duty, foreseeability, and liability for dangerous conditions and animal behavior — courts frequently analyze duty, breach, causation, and foreseeability in negligence claims (Plaintiff cites such SJC precedent generally and requests the Court and opposing counsel to identify controlling SJC decisions such as those addressing duty in premises and animal cases).

(Notes: Plaintiff is proceeding pro se. The above authorities are presented to inform the Court and opposing party of legal principles relevant to the claim of negligence. Plaintiff requests the Court and counsel to rely on controlling Massachusetts statutory and case law and to supply additional controlling citations as necessary. Plaintiff is not a lawyer and respectfully requests that the Court construe this pleading liberally in accordance with Mass. R. Civ. P. and applicable precedents governing pro se litigants.)
