COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Under Massachusetts law)

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Torres, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Torres ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment [Unit No. if any], Brockton, Massachusetts 02301. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the "Premises"), and at all times relevant was Plaintiff’s landlord.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a rental arrangement under which Plaintiff has occupied the Premises since January 1, 2022, and pays Defendant monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00.

4. The amount in controversy falls within the jurisdictional limits of the Brockton District Court. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the Premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Beginning on or about November 9, 2025 (approximately three weeks prior to December 1, 2025), the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment ceased functioning. Plaintiff immediately reported the lack of hot water to Defendant on the same day.

6. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part and that he had ordered the part from a supplier. Plaintiff was told that Defendant was arranging the repair.

7. Over the ensuing weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly communicated with Defendant regarding the lack of hot water. Defendant responded and stated that the necessary part was backordered and that he was "working on it" but that he could not make the supplier ship faster.

8. Despite Defendant’s communications and assurances, at all times relevant the Premises continued to lack hot water for approximately three weeks (and through the date of this Complaint), which has prevented Plaintiff and her household from using the apartment’s plumbing for normal bathing and dishwashing functions with hot water.

9. As a direct result of the prolonged lack of hot water, Plaintiff has sustained actual, provable damages including, but not limited to:
   a. Out-of-pocket expenses for using gym facilities to shower, $30.00 per month (for the period without hot water);
   b. Additional gasoline costs to travel to the gym and to transport her infant to her mother’s house for baths;
   c. Necessity of transporting and relying on family to bathe Plaintiff’s infant because the Premises were unfit for bathing a child due to lack of hot water;
   d. General inconvenience, discomfort, and loss of use and enjoyment of the leased Premises.

10. Plaintiff believes and avers that her total damages to date resulting from Defendant’s failure to provide hot water and to repair the same in a reasonable time are approximately $450.00. Plaintiff reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial, including any additional expenses, consequential damages, and reasonable costs.

11. Plaintiff provided Defendant with timely notice of the condition and an opportunity to cure by reporting the defect and following up as described above. Defendant had actual knowledge of the defect and failed to repair the essential service (hot water) within a reasonable time despite the notice and repeated communications.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts common law)

12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. Under Massachusetts common law, every lease carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under which the landlord must provide tenants with possession and use of the leased premises without substantial interference. The covenant protects tenants from landlord acts or omissions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

14. The continued lack of hot water at the Premises, together with Defendant’s failure to effect repair in a reasonable time after notice, constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

15. Defendant’s failure to promptly repair or restore hot water—an essential service for bathing, sanitation, and ordinary residential use—was unreasonable in the circumstances given the essential nature of hot water and the repeated notices and communications from Plaintiff.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss of the benefit of the bargain, out-of-pocket expenses (including gym fees, gas, and other costs), inconvenience, humiliation, emotional distress, and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial, and presently believed to be approximately $450.00 plus any additional recoverable damages, interest, and costs.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, presently believed to be at least $450.00, for Plaintiff’s actual expenses, consequential damages, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;

B. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;

C. Costs of suit and other recoverable litigation expenses;

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
