COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Carter (hereinafter "Plaintiff"), by counsel pro se, for her complaint against Defendant John Thompson (hereinafter "Defendant"), states as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant John Thompson is an individual and the owner/occupant of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201. Upon information and belief Defendant resides or conducts activities at that address.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on August 12, 2023, at or immediately adjacent to Defendant’s property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201.

4. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Berkshire Superior Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 4 above as if fully set forth herein.

6. For a prolonged period prior to August 12, 2023, a large maple tree located in front of Defendant’s property at 123 Maple Street had a major limb/branch which was visibly cracked, droopy, and otherwise in an unsafe condition. The limb overhung the public sidewalk adjacent to the Defendant’s property.

7. Plaintiff and numerous neighbors observed the cracked and drooping condition of the branch. Several neighbors informed Defendant of the condition and advised Defendant to retain an arborist or otherwise take measures to inspect and/or remove or secure the dangerous branch. On at least one occasion Defendant told neighbors he would "deal with it in the spring."

8. Despite actual notice of the dangerous condition and ample opportunity to inspect, repair, or remove the dangerous branch, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, trim, support, or remove the cracked limb and otherwise failed to exercise reasonable care for the safety of pedestrians using the sidewalk.

9. On August 12, 2023, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm (not extraordinary weather, hurricane, tornado, or other force majeure), and while Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the sidewalk adjacent to 123 Maple Street carrying grocery bags, the cracked limb suddenly and without warning broke off and fell directly onto Plaintiff’s shoulder and back.

10. The fallen branch knocked Plaintiff to the ground and caused immediate pain and injury.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the falling branch and Defendant’s negligent failure to remedy the dangerous condition, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, required medical treatment, and missed work.

12. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date are approximately $1,200.00 and Plaintiff suffered lost wages of approximately $650.00 as a direct result of her injuries. Plaintiff also suffered pain and suffering and other economic and non-economic damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 12 above as if fully set forth herein.

14. At all times material herein, Defendant owed Plaintiff and other lawful users of the sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s property a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance and control of trees and branches on his property where those trees and branches posed a foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians.

15. Defendant breached that duty by failing to inspect, maintain, trim, support, or remove the cracked and drooping branch, despite actual knowledge (or constructive knowledge) of the dangerous condition and despite reasonable opportunity to correct the hazard.

16. Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of the branch’s fall and of Plaintiff’s injuries, damages and losses described herein.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, incurred medical expenses, lost earnings, experienced pain and suffering, disability and impairment, and has otherwise been harmed in an amount to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including compensatory damages for medical expenses (approximately $1,200), lost wages (approximately $650), pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic losses;

B. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. For the costs of suit and disbursements incurred herein; and

D. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

To establish the foregoing claim of negligence, Plaintiff relies upon the Massachusetts statutory and common law principles governing negligence and premises maintenance/duty of care, including but not limited to the following authorities and authorities of general application in Massachusetts and elsewhere recognizing the duty of landowners to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to persons legally on or adjacent to their property:

Statutes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for actions of tort for personal injuries).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 84 (statutes concerning highways and sidewalks generally; see especially provisions relating to responsibilities and liabilities arising from sidewalks abutting private property).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, general provisions governing civil actions and procedure.

Restatement and Secondary Authorities
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283, 323, 343 (duty, foreseeability, and possessor liability for physical harm).
- Prosser and Keeton on Torts (discussing standards of care, premises liability, and duties of landowners).

Massachusetts Cases and Principles (illustrative)
- Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decisions recognizing the general duty of property owners to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of their premises and the requirement of actual or constructive notice of dangerous conditions before liability may be imposed (see, e.g., cases addressing landowner duties, notice, foreseeability, and proximate causation in premises-related torts).
- Leading negligence principles as articulated in Massachusetts cases addressing duty, breach, causation, and damages.

(These authorities are offered for the Court’s convenience and to frame the legal basis for Plaintiff’s claim. Plaintiff will rely upon and, if required, cite additional Massachusetts cases and statutory authority in briefs and at trial to support the elements of negligence alleged herein.)
