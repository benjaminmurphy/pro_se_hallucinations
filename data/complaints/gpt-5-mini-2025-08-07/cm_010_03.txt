Michael Smith
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/PRIMARY RESIDENCE

1. Parties
   - Petitioner: Jennifer Smith, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com, resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
   - Respondent: Michael Smith, address unknown to Petitioner (resides in Middlesex County), father of the child named below.

2. Child(ren)
   - Emma Smith, born [date withheld per privacy], age 10.

3. Jurisdiction and Venue
   - This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law governing child custody and parental responsibility, including the Massachusetts enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C. Venue in Middlesex Probate and Family Court is proper because the child is a resident of Middlesex County and the existing custody order was entered in this Court.

4. Existing Order
   - On or about May 15, 2017, this Court entered a custody/parenting order establishing the child’s primary residence with Respondent (father) and awarding Petitioner (mother) limited parenting time: Fridays after school through Sundays at 5:00 p.m., plus one weeknight dinner visit each week (the “2017 Order”). A certified copy of the 2017 Order will be filed with or attached to this Complaint.

5. Basis for Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
   - Petitioner seeks modification of the 2017 Order based on a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of that order that affects the child’s welfare and makes modification in the child’s best interests appropriate.
   - At the time of the 2017 Order, Petitioner was a graduate student, living in a small studio apartment, and had an inflexible schedule that limited her ability to parent. The parenting plan entered in 2017 reflected those circumstances.
   - Since entry of the 2017 Order, Petitioner’s circumstances have changed materially and substantially:
     a) Education and Employment: Petitioner completed graduate school (degree awarded prior to December 1, 2025), obtained stable employment with regular daytime hours (full-time, standard weekday schedule) and predictable work leave and flexibility for parenting time.
     b) Residence: Petitioner now resides in a secure two‑bedroom apartment in Middlesex County where the child has a permanent, private bedroom and adequate space for schoolwork and personal belongings.
     c) Parent-Child Relationship and Child’s Preference: The child is now ten years old and has developed a significantly closer relationship with Petitioner during expanded visits. The child’s therapist has advised that the child experiences guilt and distress when visits with Petitioner end early and has recommended increased overnight time with Petitioner. The child has written a letter expressing a clear preference for increased overnights and more regular residence time with Petitioner; a copy of the therapist’s statement and the child’s letter will be filed with or attached to this Complaint (subject to any rules regarding children’s statements).
     d) Respondent’s Position: Respondent has refused to negotiate or meaningfully discuss reasonable modification of the parenting schedule, and has reacted angrily when the child raises the subject, which has caused emotional stress to the child.
   - These changes are material, substantial, and unanticipated at the time of the 2017 Order and bear directly on the welfare, stability, and best interests of the child.

6. Legal Standard
   - Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification of custody/primary residence must show that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior order that affects the child’s welfare and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. The Court’s inquiry focuses on the child’s health, safety, welfare, and best interests; the Court may consider the child’s expressed preferences consistent with the child’s age and maturity, the stability of each parent’s present living situation, the child’s relationship with each parent, and any professional recommendations affecting the child’s well‑being.

7. Facts Demonstrating Child’s Best Interests Will Be Served by Modification
   - Petitioner’s stable employment and predictable daytime schedule will allow her to provide consistent routine, homework supervision, medical appointments, and extracurricular transportation.
   - Petitioner’s two‑bedroom apartment provides the child with her own bedroom and a stable home environment appropriate for a ten‑year-old.
   - The child has told her therapist and Petitioner that she feels guilty and upset when visits with Petitioner end after short periods and has asked for more overnights. The therapist’s professional observation is that increasing the child’s time with Petitioner would promote the child’s emotional well‑being.
   - The child’s expressed preference for increased overnights is credible and should be given appropriate weight by the Court.
   - Given Respondent’s unwillingness to negotiate and the child’s demonstrated distress under the current schedule, judicial intervention is necessary to protect the child’s welfare.

8. Relief Requested
   Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   a) Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2017 Order warranting modification of the parenting schedule.
   b) Modify the 2017 Order to provide for increased parenting time with Petitioner, including (but not limited to):
      - Regular overnight parenting time sufficient to allow meaningful parent‑child attachment (for example: two weeknights per week overnight and alternating extended weekends, or such other schedule the Court deems in the child’s best interests); and
      - Adjustment of school‑day and school‑year schedules as necessary to reflect the child’s current educational needs, including transportation arrangements and holiday schedules.
   c) Order any evaluations, parenting coordination, or mediation the Court deems appropriate to facilitate transition to the new schedule and to address co‑parenting communication issues.
   d) Order Respondent to cooperate in reasonable exchange of medical, school, and therapeutic information and to participate in court‑ordered mediation or co‑parenting counseling if directed by the Court.
   e) Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper for the health, safety, and welfare of the child.

9. Notice and Service
   - Petitioner will serve Respondent with this Complaint and all supporting documents in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and the Probate and Family Court rules.

10. Attachments and Exhibits
   - Petitioner will file or attach the following documents in support of this Complaint:
     a) A certified copy of the 2017 custody/parenting order entered May 15, 2017.
     b) Proof of Petitioner’s current residence (lease or utility bill).
     c) Verification of Petitioner’s employment and work schedule.
     d) A letter from the child’s therapist summarizing the therapist’s recommendations regarding parenting time (subject to any protective or confidentiality rules).
     e) A copy of the child’s letter to the Court expressing preference.
     f) Any other records demonstrating the material change in circumstances and the child’s current best interests.

Notes for the Court and Parties (informational)
- Petitioner specifically requests the Court to consider the child’s therapist’s professional recommendation and the child’s expressed preference, and to schedule an early hearing so the child’s emotional needs are promptly addressed.
- Petitioner is prepared to propose a detailed parenting schedule (with proposed weekdays, overnights, holiday allocation, and transportation plan) to the Court or to submit a parenting plan following any mediation or assessment the Court orders.

Legal Basis (summary)
- Petitioner relies on Massachusetts law recognizing that custody and parenting time determinations must be made in light of the child’s best interests and that prior orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare. Petitioner also invokes the Massachusetts enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, and the general Massachusetts principles that courts should consider stability of each parent’s present residence and caregiving capacity, the child’s preference (as appropriate), the emotional bonds between child and parent, and recommendations from treating professionals in deciding custody/parenting time modifications.
