COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jacob Miller is an adult resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Emily Johnson is the owner of a three-unit residential building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, and, upon information and belief, resides or does business in Worcester County.
1.3 Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Worcester District Court because the incident described below occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the amounts sought are within this Court’s jurisdiction.
1.4 This action is brought under Massachusetts law for negligence arising out of personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff on February 10, 2023.

2. Factual Allegations
2.1 On or about February 10, 2023, at or near the sidewalk and entrance serving the residential building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises while delivering groceries to a tenant of that building.
2.2 At all times relevant, Defendant owned, occupied, controlled, and/or had responsibility for maintenance of the sidewalk and walkway areas adjacent to and in front of the building at 123 Maple Street, including the sidewalk where Plaintiff was injured.
2.3 Following a snowstorm preceding February 10, 2023, Defendant cleared a narrow footpath down the middle of the sidewalk but did not apply any deicing material (such as salt or sand) to the cleared path or to the adjacent sidewalk surfaces.
2.4 Over the next several days, the narrow cleared path repeatedly melted during the day and refroze at night such that the cleared path became an expanse of slick, hard ice, creating a hazardous condition on the sidewalk.
2.5 Prior to Plaintiff’s fall, tenants of the building observed the hazardous icy condition and, upon information and belief, texted and sent photographs to Defendant to notify her of the condition and to request remedial action.
2.6 Defendant, via text message or other communication, responded to tenants that “the sun will take care of it,” and she failed to take any reasonable remedial action (such as applying salt, sand, or otherwise treating or barricading the hazardous area) prior to February 10, 2023.
2.7 On February 10, 2023, while walking on the sidewalk at 123 Maple Street in the ordinary course of delivering groceries, Plaintiff stepped onto the icy patch and his feet slipped out from under him, causing him to fall backward and land hard on his lower back.
2.8 As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained injury to his lower back, required medical treatment, incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses, and lost approximately $1,000 in earnings due to missed work. Plaintiff also suffered pain, disability, inconvenience, emotional distress, and medical care and attention.
2.9 The hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
2.10 Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk and failed to remedy, warn of, or otherwise protect lawful entrants like Plaintiff from the danger.

3. Cause of Action — Negligence (Count I)
3.1 Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.10 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or possessor of land who has control over an area used by invitees or licensees owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of hazardous conditions known to the owner or that should have been discovered by reasonable inspection. See, generally, Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A, 344.
3.3 Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a person lawfully on the premises delivering groceries to a tenant, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk and in warning of or remedying known hazardous ice conditions.
3.4 Defendant breached that duty by failing to take reasonable steps to eliminate, treat, barricade, or warn of the hazardous ice on the sidewalk, despite notice or constructive notice of the condition (including messages and photographs from tenants) and despite the reasonable foreseeability that the untreated cleared path would refreeze and create a dangerous condition.
3.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining injury and damages as described above, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other losses.
3.6 Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct and not by any superseding or intervening cause for which Defendant is not responsible.

4. Damages
4.1 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered:
   (a) Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500;
   (b) Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000;
   (c) Past and future physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other general damages in an amount to be proven at trial but within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.
4.2 Plaintiff reserves the right to amend and supplement the above amounts as additional medical and other bills and wage loss information becomes available.

5. Applicable Law and Authorities (Representative)
Note: The following list provides commonly cited authorities setting out the governing principles of negligence and premises liability generally relied upon in Massachusetts practice. Plaintiff relies upon Massachusetts common law principles of negligence and premises liability and applicable Massachusetts statutes and rules, including but not limited to:
   - Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 10(a), 11 (pleading and signature requirements).
   - Massachusetts General Laws, ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for tort actions).
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A, 344, 352 (duty of landowner to entrants; duty to warn and to make safe).
   - Massachusetts decisional law recognizing the duty of property owners to use reasonable care to maintain premises in a safe condition and to warn of known dangers (see, e.g., cases and authorities addressing premises liability generally).
   - Relevant local ordinances and housing codes may also impose duties concerning sidewalk maintenance and safe conditions (to the extent applicable).
Plaintiff intends to rely upon such authorities, including relevant Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court precedent recognizing landowner duties and the elements of negligence, in support of the claims at trial and in briefing.

6. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:
   A. Award compensatory damages for Plaintiff’s economic losses, including medical expenses (approximately $2,500) and lost wages (approximately $1,000);
   B. Award compensatory damages for Plaintiff’s non-economic losses, including pain and suffering, emotional distress, disability, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined at trial and within the jurisdictional limits of this Court;
   C. Award Plaintiff costs, interest, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff hereby demands a jury trial on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT AUTHORITIES: I have drafted the foregoing complaint using the facts you provided and relying on well-established negligence principles (including the Restatement (Second) of Torts and Massachusetts pleading rules and statutes such as Mass. G. L. ch. 260 § 2A). I have not included a comprehensive annotated list of Massachusetts cases and detailed case citations in this draft. If you would like, I can supplement this complaint with specific Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions (with full citations) that plaintiffs commonly rely on in Massachusetts premises-liability cases; however, compiling and verifying an authoritative list of specific Massachusetts precedents requires careful legal research to avoid incorrect or inapplicable citations. If you want that supplemental legal research added, I can prepare it for you.
