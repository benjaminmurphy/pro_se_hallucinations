v.

MARK JOHNSON,
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff") resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant Mark Johnson ("Defendant") is the other parent of the minor child named below and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the Massachusetts statutes governing custody, visitation and child-related orders, and under the UCCJEA as codified in Massachusetts. Venue is properly laid in Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the parties and the minor child reside in this county and because the existing custody order was entered by this Court.

2. Minor Child
2.1. The minor child who is the subject of this complaint is:
- Ethan Johnson, born in 2017 (currently age 8).

3. Existing Order
3.1. On May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order concerning Ethan Johnson. Under that order, Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody and Defendant was awarded three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit. No overnight parenting time was granted to Defendant at that time because Defendant was living in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have adequate space for the child.

4. Statement of Material Change in Circumstances
4.1. Since entry of the May 15, 2018 order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare, routine, and best interests of the child.
4.2. Defendant now resides in his own apartment and has stable, appropriate housing that includes a bedroom available for the child. The housing condition that was a basis for denying overnights in 2018 has materially changed.
4.3. The child is now eight years old and attends school full time. Ethan requests regular sleepovers at Defendant’s home and is seeking a schedule appropriate to his age and developmental needs.
4.4. Under the existing short-visit schedule, Ethan is frequently transported back and forth on school nights for brief visits. These frequent school-night transitions interfere with consistent homework routines, bedtime, sufficient sleep, and the child’s overall school-day routine and functioning. The current schedule has become impracticable and is causing fatigue and disruption for the child and the parties.
4.5. Both parents recognize that the existing schedule is no longer appropriate and agree that a new parenting time arrangement that permits overnight visits and reduces school-night transfers would better serve the child’s best interests. (While the parties agree on the need for change, the Plaintiff brings this Complaint to obtain an enforceable, court-ordered modification that protects the child’s established routine and stability.)

5. Legal Standard
5.1. Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting time orders may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the last order was entered and upon a finding that modification is in the best interests of the child. The best-interests inquiry focuses on the health, safety, welfare, and developmental needs of the child, including needs for stability, routine, schooling, and adequate parenting time with each parent.
5.2. Plaintiff states that the facts alleged above establish a material change in circumstances (changed housing of Defendant; child’s age and school needs; interference with school-night routine caused by current schedule) that warrant modification of the existing custody/parenting time order.

6. Relief Requested
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
6.1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody/parenting time order;
6.2. Modify the existing custody/parenting time order to reflect the current circumstances and the best interests of the child, including, at minimum:
   a. Authorization for Defendant to have overnight/unsupervised parenting time with the child in Defendant’s home, subject to such conditions as the Court deems appropriate (for example, a phased introduction of overnight time, provision of contact information for school/daycare, and clear holiday and transportation arrangements); and
   b. Adjustment of weekday parenting time so as to avoid unnecessary school-night transfers and to preserve the child’s regular homework and bedtime routine (for example, shifting short midweek visits to a pattern that does not require late-night returns, or providing for a midweek overnight schedule if appropriate); and
6.3. Retain primary physical custody of Ethan with Plaintiff, unless the Court, after hearing, determines otherwise in the best interests of the child;
6.4. Award such further relief as the Court deems just and proper to effectuate a stable, age-appropriate parenting-time schedule that safeguards the child’s educational routine, sleep schedule, and overall welfare;
6.5. Enter any necessary orders regarding parenting time exchanges, transportation responsibilities, notice requirements to the schools, and any other matters necessary to implement the modified schedule; and
6.6. Grant such other and further relief as the Court may deem equitable and appropriate.

7. Notice of Hearing; Temporary Relief
7.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint. If the Court deems it appropriate, Plaintiff requests temporary relief pending final hearing to minimize disruption to the child’s routine (for example, temporary authorization for reasonable overnight visits or adjustments to weekday visits that reduce school-night shuttling), consistent with the child’s best interests.
