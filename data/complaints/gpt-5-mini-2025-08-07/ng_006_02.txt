COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Alex Rivera ("Plaintiff") is an individual and a resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Jordan Smith ("Defendant") is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and was the operator of a motor vehicle involved in the incident described below.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, because this civil action arises out of torts committed in Suffolk County and the matter is one cognizable by the Superior Court.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court because the incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the County of Suffolk, at or near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately the time relevant hereto, Plaintiff was lawfully riding his bicycle to work, traveling in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.

6. Plaintiff was properly wearing his helmet and obeying all applicable traffic laws and signals at the time of the incident.

7. At the same time and place, Defendant had stopped and parked a motor vehicle in a loading zone adjacent to the marked bike lane.

8. Without checking for oncoming bicyclists or other traffic, and while allegedly looking at his phone, Defendant suddenly opened his vehicle’s passenger-side door directly into the path of Plaintiff’s bicycle as Plaintiff was passing.

9. The opening of Defendant’s door occurred without warning and without sufficient time or space for Plaintiff to stop, swerve, or otherwise avoid collision.

10. Plaintiff collided with the edge of the open vehicle door, was thrown from his bicycle, and struck the pavement.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the collision, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, including road rash on his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth. Plaintiff’s bicycle sustained a bent frame and was rendered unusable.

12. At the scene Defendant admitted that he "didn't see" Plaintiff because he was checking his phone. Defendant later denied fault to his insurer and claimed Plaintiff had been "weaving in and out of traffic," a statement inconsistent with the facts set forth above.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical and dental expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500, lost earnings of approximately $800, and suffered property damage to his bicycle (amount to be proven at trial). Plaintiff has also suffered pain, suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and impairment of daily activities.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Mass. Gen. Laws; Common Law)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed Plaintiff, and other bicyclists and road users, a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid causing injury. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282 (duty), and Massachusetts decisions recognizing the duty to act with reasonable care toward foreseeable victims.

16. Defendant breached that duty by, among other acts and omissions: (a) opening his vehicle door into the path of oncoming bicycle traffic without first ensuring it was safe to do so; (b) failing to check mirrors or to look for approaching bicyclists before opening the door; (c) failing to keep a proper lookout; (d) operating and using his vehicle in a negligent manner; and (e) failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

17. Defendant’s acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses described above.

18. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer past and future damages, including but not limited to: medical and dental expenses, lost wages, property damage (bicycle), physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. The full extent of Plaintiff’s damages will be established at trial.
