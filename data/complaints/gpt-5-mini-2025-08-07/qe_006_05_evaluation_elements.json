    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff began renting the Premises on January 1, 2022, states a month-to-month/lease tenancy, the monthly rent amount, and identifies Defendant as the owner and landlord. These factual allegations are sufficient to establish a landlord\u2013tenant relationship at the pleading stage."

    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a specific omission by Defendant: failure to provide hot water beginning on or about November 10, 2025, despite notice from Plaintiff and Defendant\u2019s representations that he ordered a replacement part. Those facts adequately plead an act/omission by the landlord (failure to repair/restore essential service)."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the lack of hot water persisted for approximately three weeks and caused concrete deprivations\u2014unable to shower at home, forced use of a gym (with out\u2011of\u2011pocket costs and travel), inability to bathe an infant at home, and difficulty washing dishes\u2014facts that, if proven, constitute a substantial interference with use and enjoyment of the premises."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff notified Defendant immediately and that Defendant\u2019s failure to procure/install the replacement part (and failure to provide alternative measures) resulted in continued lack of hot water. That sequence of notice, landlord inaction, and continuing deprivation adequately pleads causation between landlord conduct and the interference."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads specific out\u2011of\u2011pocket expenses (gym membership, transportation, childcare/bathing arrangements and incidental costs), an estimated monetary total (~$500), and non\u2011economic harms (inconvenience, emotional distress). Those allegations are sufficient to plead damages at the complaint stage."
