      "support_reasoning": "Troxel v. Granville is a U.S. Supreme Court case about the constitutional due process rights of fit parents to control third\u2011party (grandparent) visitation. It does not address parental substance abuse, impairment, or material change in circumstances, nor does it discuss modification of custody/visitation based on such factors or the imposition of supervised or restricted visitation for that reason. The case instead focuses on the breadth and constitutionality of a nonparental visitation statute and the deference owed to fit parents\u2019 decisions, so it does not support the specific proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cFirst, the Troxels did not allege, and no court has found, that Granville was an unfit parent. That aspect of the case is important, for there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children. \u2026 Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family\u2026.\u201d"
