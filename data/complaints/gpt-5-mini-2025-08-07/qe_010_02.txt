COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — Lowell, Massachusetts)

1.     Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue

1.1    Plaintiff Sarah Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Ms. Thompson") is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment __, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

1.2    Defendant Linda Martinez ("Defendant" or "Landlord") is the owner and landlord of residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851, and was the landlord of Plaintiff’s apartment during the period relevant to this Complaint.

1.3    Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential lease/rental tenancy for the apartment at 123 Maple Street commencing on May 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00. Plaintiff is a tenant and Defendant is a landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

1.4    Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Lowell District Court because the real property that is the subject of this action is located in Lowell, Middlesex County, and the amount claimed is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

2.     Statement of Facts

2.1    Plaintiff began renting the apartment at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA on May 1, 2022, and has continuously occupied the premises since that date.

2.2    Sometime in 2024 (and observed/continuing into 2025), Plaintiff discovered mold growth in the bathroom of the apartment. The mold initially appeared in a corner of the shower and subsequently spread onto the bathroom ceiling.

2.3    The bathroom lacks a window and relies on a ceiling-mounted mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation. Plaintiff uses the fan when showering, although there may have been occasions when the fan was not run for every single shower. Plaintiff commonly takes warm-to-hot showers and does not believe her showering habits were extreme or unusual.

2.4    After discovering the mold, Plaintiff promptly reported the condition to Defendant. Defendant visited the apartment to inspect the mold and acknowledged its presence but told Plaintiff that she was at fault — blaming Plaintiff for "not running the exhaust fan enough" and for taking showers that were "too hot and too long."

2.5    Following the inspection, Defendant offered to clean the visible mold but refused to remediate the underlying cause by improving ventilation or otherwise undertaking measures to prevent recurrent mold growth. Defendant expressly stated she would not remedy the ventilation issue because she believed Plaintiff "caused" the problem.

2.6    Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has suffered new and ongoing respiratory symptoms including coughing, nasal congestion, and wheezing. Plaintiff sought medical attention; her treating physician advised her that the symptoms are consistent with exposure to mold and recommended remediation of the apartment to prevent further harm.

2.7    As a direct result of the mold condition, Plaintiff discarded a shower curtain and several towels that sustained mold contamination, for a total out-of-pocket loss of approximately $60.00. Plaintiff claims additional non-economic harm due to diminished habitability and loss of use and enjoyment of the premises.

2.8    Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant take effective remedial steps (beyond surface cleaning) to abate the mold problem by addressing ventilation and any water intrusion or structural defects that allow mold growth. Defendant has not agreed to undertake such remedial measures.

2.9    The mold condition and Defendant’s refusal to remediate the underlying causes materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, caused or exacerbated Plaintiff’s medical conditions, and caused Plaintiff emotional distress and inconvenience.

3.     Legal Background — Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment and Applicable Law

3.1    Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes a tenant the covenant of quiet enjoyment (an implied covenant) which guarantees that the tenant will have the right to the possession and beneficial use of the leased premises without substantial interference from the landlord or conditions attributable to the landlord. See generally M.G.L. c. 186 and the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment.

3.2    The State Sanitary Code and public health statutes impose minimum standards for habitability and sanitary conditions and require landlords to maintain residential premises in a condition that is fit for human habitation. See, e.g., 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Mass. State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); M.G.L. c. 111 (public health statutes).

3.3    A landlord's failure to remedy conditions that materially interfere with a tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises — including persistent mold or failure to provide adequate ventilation — can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See applicable Massachusetts caselaw and authority cited below.

3.4    Plaintiff asserts the single claim in this Complaint: breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

4.     Cause of Action — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment

4.1    Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1.1 through 3.4 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2    The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in all residential leases in Massachusetts. The covenant guarantees tenants the right to undisturbed use and enjoyment of the leased premises and prohibits landlords from permitting conditions that substantially interfere with occupancy and use. Defendant’s failure to remediate recurrent mold growth and to address inadequate ventilation (a condition within the landlord’s responsibility to maintain) constitutes a substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the apartment.

4.3    Defendant's conduct — blaming Plaintiff and refusing to undertake reasonable repairs or remediation beyond cosmetic cleaning, despite knowledge of the mold, the absence of a window in the bathroom, and Plaintiff's medically-diagnosed symptoms attributable to mold exposure — constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4.4    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages and injuries:
       a) Out-of-pocket property loss (shower curtain, towels): $60.00;
       b) General damages for diminished habitability, loss of use and enjoyment, distress, inconvenience, and emotional harm: $440.00 (to reach a total asserted damages amount of $500.00);
       c) Costs of suit and interest as permitted by law.

4.5    Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff seeks actual damages in the amount of $500.00, together with costs, interest, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

5.     Authorities and Legal Support (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Caselaw)

(Note: Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and controlling caselaw recognizing the landlord’s duties and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Representative authorities include, without limitation, the following:)

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (General provisions concerning landlord-tenant relations and tenants’ remedies).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary process jurisdiction and related provisions for landlord-tenant matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §§ 122, 127, 127A (public health powers and duties; inspection and abatement of public health nuisances).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation and related provisions regarding sanitary conditions, ventilation, and moisture/mold control).
- 105 CMR 410.350–410.400 (provisions addressing ventilation, heating, and general maintenance of sanitary conditions — as applicable to habitability).

Representative Massachusetts Caselaw (illustrative; Plaintiff will rely on applicable precedent)
- cases recognizing the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in Massachusetts landlord-tenant relationships and landlord obligations to provide and maintain habitable premises; and
- Massachusetts decisions addressing landlord liability for conditions that materially interfere with tenancy (e.g., cases discussing mold, vermin, dampness, inadequate heating/ventilation, or other conditions affecting habitability and quiet enjoyment).
(General examples of Massachusetts authorities recognizing these principles include decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court addressing landlord duties, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and habitability standards. Plaintiff intends to rely upon such relevant authorities at trial and in any dispositive motions.)

6.     Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Sarah Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:

a) Compensatory damages in the amount of $500.00 for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b) Costs of suit and such pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
c) Any other relief that the Court deems just and equitable under the circumstances, including injunctive or declaratory relief if the Court deems it appropriate to compel remediation and correction of the conditions that have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the premises.

7.     Jury Demand

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
