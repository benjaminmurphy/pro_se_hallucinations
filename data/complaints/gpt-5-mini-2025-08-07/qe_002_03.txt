Jordan Mitchell,
    Plaintiff,

v.

Samantha Baker,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(only claim)

Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell (hereinafter "Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Samantha Baker (hereinafter "Defendant"), alleges as follows:

I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents a basement apartment located at 24-26 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

2. Defendant Samantha Baker is the owner and landlord of the premises at 24-26 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 and is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. Plaintiff began tenancy of the basement unit on March 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

4. The Housing Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under Massachusetts law because the dispute arises from a landlord-tenant relationship and the premises are located in the City of Boston (Roxbury). Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court pursuant to the governing venue provisions for landlord-tenant matters.

5. Plaintiff seeks money damages, costs, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff has been a tenant of the basement unit at 24-26 Elm Street since March 1, 2022 under a month-to-month tenancy/lease (the tenancy).

7. The rent for the unit is $1,200 per month, paid by Plaintiff to Defendant. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent because of medical bills. Plaintiff promptly paid the October rent and paid the landlord’s late fee, satisfying the outstanding rent and charges.

8. In November 2025, following a period of heavy rain, Plaintiff discovered water seeping in through the basement wall of the unit. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant by text message that the wall was leaking and that water was entering the basement during storms. Defendant replied she would "look into it."

9. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s assurance. Several weeks passed, during which heavy rain events continued to cause water to seep into the basement unit and the condition remained unfixed.

10. Because Defendant did not timely remediate the water intrusion, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston and requested an inspection. City inspectors responded, inspected the premises, and documented the water intrusion and certain other code deficiencies.

11. The persistent water intrusion and damp conditions have caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property. Specifically, a rug and a bookshelf that were placed against the affected basement wall were damaged beyond reasonable repair. Plaintiff estimates the value of the damaged property at approximately $400.

12. The continued dampness and elevated humidity in the unit have forced Plaintiff to operate a dehumidifier continuously in an effort to reduce moisture and prevent mold. This constant operation has increased Plaintiff’s electricity usage and bill; Plaintiff has incurred higher utility costs as a direct result of the continued water intrusion and Defendant’s failure to timely remediate.

13. Defendant has not taken adequate, timely steps to repair the basement wall or otherwise remediate the water intrusion and resulting habitability problems.

14. After the City inspection and the documented code issues, Defendant stated to Plaintiff that she considers Plaintiff a "problem tenant" and that she will not renew the lease when it expires in March 2026. Defendant has stated the non-renewal decision is based on Plaintiff's October late rent payment. The timing of Defendant’s statements, however, followed closely after the City inspection and the reporting of code/habitation problems by Plaintiff, and Plaintiff reasonably believes the inspection and complaints contributed to Defendant’s decision and retaliatory attitude toward Plaintiff.

15. Defendant's failure to remediate the water intrusion; the continuing water damage, ongoing dampness, and related property damage; the need to run a dehumidifier constantly; and Defendant’s statements and conduct have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

III. CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts law)

16. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above.

17. Under Massachusetts law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment exists in residential tenancies. The covenant protects tenants against landlord conduct or neglect that substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

18. Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to maintain the premises in a habitable condition and to repair conditions that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment, including repairing water intrusion and conditions that create excessive dampness, and to comply with applicable health and safety standards and housing codes.

19. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by (a) failing to take timely and reasonable action to repair the basement wall and stopping the water intrusion after Plaintiff’s notice; (b) allowing conditions to persist that caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property; (c) allowing the premises to remain in a condition that required continuous use of a dehumidifier and caused increased utility expense; and (d) engaging in conduct (including stated intent not to renew the lease shortly after the inspection and complaints) that has interfered with Plaintiff’s lawful and peaceful occupation of the premises.

20. The City of Boston inspection and findings of water intrusion and code violations corroborate that the conditions materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment and that Defendant failed to remedy the condition within a reasonable time after notice.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages including, without limitation: (a) damage to personal property (approximately $400); (b) increased utility costs resulting from continuous dehumidifier use; (c) emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of the use and enjoyment of the premises; and (d) costs and expenses incurred to mitigate damage (including time spent communicating with Defendant and City inspectors). Plaintiff requests an award for compensatory damages for these losses.

22. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the damages and has demanded that Defendant remedy the condition; Defendant has not done so within a reasonable time.

IV. DAMAGES

23. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for property loss in the amount of approximately $400, plus recovery for increased utility costs (to be proven at trial), non-economic damages for loss of quiet enjoyment, costs of mitigation, pre-judgement and post-judgment interest, and costs of suit.

24. Plaintiff also seeks an order declaring that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and that Defendant is responsible for damages resulting from that breach.

V. APPLICABLE LAW (Representative statutory and regulatory authorities and illustrative authorities interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law)

Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, the State Sanitary Code, and related authority, including but not limited to:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general landlord-tenant statutory framework);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process) (procedures governing landlord-tenant litigation in the Housing Court);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and related provisions concerning public health and sanitary conditions and local boards of health;
- State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation);
- Massachusetts State Building Code, 780 CMR (applicable codes and standards regarding building safety and maintenance);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (consumer protection statute) — cited as background for obligations of landlords to act in good faith toward tenants (Plaintiff is not bringing a separate Chapter 93A claim but cites it as reflective of statutory standards of fair dealing);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §15B (statutory provisions governing security deposits and related landlord duties) — as an example of other specific landlord obligations under chapter 186;
- Applicable municipal housing and building codes enforced by the City of Boston (as enacted and enforced pursuant to state law);
- Judicial authority recognizing the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties to maintain habitability and refrain from materially interfering with tenants’ possession (see Massachusetts cases and appellate authority addressing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations in landlord-tenant and housing contexts).

(Plaintiff will rely on and cite specific Massachusetts cases and additional statutory/regulatory authorities at or before trial and expects to rely on controlling precedent interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including SJC and Appeals Court authority addressing landlord breach for failure to correct habitability defects, landlord conduct constituting constructive eviction, and related doctrines. Representative decisions interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties will be cited in Plaintiff’s trial memorandum and any motion papers.)

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff by failing to timely and adequately remedy water intrusion and related habitability conditions at the leased premises;

B. Compensatory damages for property loss (approximately $400) and for increased utility costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach, in an amount to be established at trial;

C. Damages for loss of use and quiet enjoyment, inconvenience, and emotional distress, in an amount to be proven at trial;

D. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

E. Costs of suit and other statutory costs allowable in this Court;

F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

VII. TRIAL BY JURY

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury of all claims so triable.
