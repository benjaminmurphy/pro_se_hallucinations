COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1.    Parties
      1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Martin ("Plaintiff") is an individual resident of Brockton, Massachusetts, who rents residential premises located at 250 Main St, Apartment __, Brockton, MA 02301 (the "Premises").
      1.2 Defendant Thomas Reynolds ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the Premises and may be served at 250 Main St, Brockton, MA 02301 or at any other address at which he may be found.

2.    Jurisdiction and Venue
      2.1 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law because the subject property is located in Brockton, Massachusetts and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton.
      2.2 Venue is proper in Brockton District Court pursuant to the Massachusetts venue statutes governing actions concerning tenancy and real property and because the Premises are located in Brockton.

3.    Background / Tenancy
      3.1 Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a tenancy for the Premises that began on January 1, 2022.
      3.2 Plaintiff pays $1,200.00 per month in rent. Plaintiff has paid rent when due and has otherwise performed all material obligations required of her as a tenant.

4.    Facts Common to All Counts
      4.1 On or about November 3, 2025 (approximately three weeks before the filing of this Complaint), the hot water supply to the Premises failed and Plaintiff ceased receiving hot water for showers, bathing and normal household needs.
      4.2 On the date the hot water failure occurred Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water. Defendant acknowledged the problem and informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part and that he had ordered the part.
      4.3 Over the following three (3) weeks Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant that the Premises continued to lack hot water. Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s messages and represented that the part had been ordered but was on backorder and that he could not make the supplier ship faster. Despite Defendant’s communications, no repair was completed and hot water was not restored.
      4.4 As a direct consequence of the lack of hot water, Plaintiff incurred unexpected expenses and hardships including: paying approximately $30 per month to shower at a gym and the additional gasoline/travel costs to reach that gym; and being forced to take her infant child to Plaintiff’s mother’s residence to provide hot baths because bath water at the Premises was cold and unsuitable for bathing a baby.
      4.5 Plaintiff has sought but not obtained repair or restoration of hot water adequate for normal residential use for a period of approximately three (3) weeks as of the date of this Complaint.
      4.6 Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain a basic essential service (hot water) substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and constituted a substantial deprivation of the quiet enjoyment of the tenancy.

5.    Claim for Relief — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts common law)
      5.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 4 as if fully set forth herein.
      5.2 Under Massachusetts law, a tenant is entitled to the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and to dwelling conditions suitable for basic residential use. A landlord’s wrongful acts or inaction that substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises constitute a breach of that covenant. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the landlord’s obligation to keep leased residential premises fit for habitation and that substantial interference with habitability may give rise to tenant remedies); see also Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and related authorities recognizing tenant rights to essential services and remedies where landlords fail to provide them.
      5.3 A landlord’s failure to provide essential services such as hot water, if substantial and continuing, amounts to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment even where the landlord communicates and attempts to arrange repairs if those attempts do not result in prompt restoration of services. See authorities cited below.
      5.4 Defendant’s continuing failure to provide hot water to the Premises for a period of approximately three (3) weeks constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and therefore a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.
      5.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred because of the lack of hot water (gym fees and travel costs) and non-economic harms related to deprivation of basic residential services and the need to provide safe bathing for an infant.
      5.6 Plaintiff estimates her compensable damages to be approximately $600.00 for the period of deprivation to date, including the gym fee and additional travel expenses, and seeks additional damages for any further deprivation until the hot water is restored, together with interest, costs, and other relief as the Court deems just.

6.    Applicable Law and Authorities (illustrative and relied upon)
      6.1 Statutes and Regulations
           - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant)
           - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process)
           - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health)

           - Applicable local housing and sanitary codes (Brockton/local code)
      6.2 Selected Case Law

           - Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (discussing implied warranty of habitability and landlord obligations; cited for principle that lack of essential services may breach landlord’s obligations)
           - (Plaintiff relies on the foregoing statutes, regulations and controlling and persuasive case authority regarding landlord obligations to maintain essential services and the tenant’s remedies for substantial interference with quiet enjoyment; further related Massachusetts caselaw and trial court decisions interpreting ch. 186 and the State Sanitary Code are applicable and will be relied upon at trial and in briefing.)

7.    Prayer for Relief
      Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant and provide the following relief:
      a.    Award compensatory damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $600.00, representing Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket damages to date, with leave to amend and seek additional damages for continuing deprivation until permanent repair and restoration of hot water;
      b.    Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;
      c.    Award Plaintiff her costs of suit and other costs and disbursements reasonably incurred in this action;
      d.    Order injunctive or declaratory relief as the Court deems appropriate to require Defendant to promptly restore and maintain hot water to the Premises and to comply with applicable housing and sanitary codes (including the State Sanitary Code), if the Court finds such equitable relief appropriate; and
      e.    Any other relief that the Court deems just and equitable.

8.    Jury Demand
      Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
