Although there was evidence that the floor was waxed some time before the night in question, there is no other evidence as to when this was... We are of opinion that the evidence reported did not warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent.\""

The defendant argues that his acquittals in a District Court on charges of illegal possession of a firearm... precluded the assault conviction. We affirm the judgment."
