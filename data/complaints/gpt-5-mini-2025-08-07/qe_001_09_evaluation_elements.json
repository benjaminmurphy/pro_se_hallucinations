  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the parties\u2019 rental relationship (tenant residence at specific apartment, landlord/owner/manager identified, tenancy start date, rent amount, and that rent has been paid), which sufficiently establishes a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads specific landlord acts/omissions: defendant arranged two repair visits, declined to effectuate a lasting repair, told tenant the boiler was \"old but functional,\" and refused to secure effective remedial measures."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges repeated, multi-hour drops in heat to ~60\u00b0F over a winter season (an essential service), use of supplemental heaters, increased utility costs, and health effects (bronchitis), facts that support a reasonable inference of substantial interference with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint links defendant\u2019s failure to timely and adequately repair the heating system to recurring inadequate heat, and ties that inadequate heat to plaintiff\u2019s increased electric bills and to bronchitis (including a physician\u2019s statement that cold indoor air likely worsened the illness), adequately pleading causation at the pleading stage."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific out-of-pocket damages (approximately $600 for increased electric bills and medical expenses), missed work (three days), and seeks recovery, which is sufficient to plead damages."
