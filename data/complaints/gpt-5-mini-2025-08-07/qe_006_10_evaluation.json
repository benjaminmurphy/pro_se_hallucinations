While the court explicitly allows recovery of rent, repair costs, and damages for discomfort and annoyance (e.g., inability to bathe due to inadequate hot water), it does so as elements of damages for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, not as a quiet enjoyment claim. The opinion mentions constructive eviction and quiet enjoyment historically but does not ground its holding or damages analysis in a covenant of quiet enjoyment theory.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe also find persuasive the reasoning of some commentators that damages should be allowed for a tenant\u2019s discomfort and annoyance arising from the landlord\u2019s breach of the implied warranty of habitability. \u2026 [T]he residential tenant who has suffered a breach of the warranty . . . cannot bathe as frequently as he would like or at all if there is inadequate hot water\u2026 Thus, discomfort and annoyance are the common injuries caused by each breach and hence the true nature of the general damages the tenant is claiming.\u201d"
