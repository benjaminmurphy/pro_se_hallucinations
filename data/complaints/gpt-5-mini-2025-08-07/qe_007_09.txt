COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential landlord-tenant matter — breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents residential premises located at 45 River Street, Apartment [Unit Number], Cambridge, MA (the “Premises”). Plaintiff’s mailing address is 45 River Street, Cambridge, MA. Plaintiff is appearing pro se.

2. Defendant Michael Richards is the landlord and owner/manager of the building in which the Premises are located. Defendant may be served at 45 River Street, Cambridge, MA (or at any other location where he may be found).

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises beginning on or about June 15, 2021. Plaintiff currently pays monthly rent of $1,800.00.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Cambridge District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 26; G.L. c. 185, § 18; and the general venue statutes because the Premises are located in Cambridge and the acts complained of occurred in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 4 as if fully set forth herein.

6. Beginning in or about October 2025, Defendant caused and/or allowed substantial renovation and construction work to commence in the adjacent unit to Plaintiff’s Premises. The construction has continued for the last two months and, as of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has represented to Plaintiff that the work may continue for an additional one to two months.

7. Construction activities have included frequent and substantial daytime drilling, hammering, pounding, and loud worker conversations and noises. The construction routinely occurs during weekday daytime hours, typically beginning at approximately 8:00 a.m. and continuing until approximately 5:00 p.m.

8. Plaintiff is employed and regularly works from home, and the prolonged, repeated, and continuous construction noise has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including Plaintiff’s ability to concentrate, perform work duties, and participate in telephonic and video calls for employment.

9. In addition to noise, construction dust and debris have entered Plaintiff’s Premises through the building vents, undermining Plaintiff’s reasonable expectation of quiet, private, and clean residential occupation.

10. Defendant provided Plaintiff with advance notice that renovation would occur and the workers generally keep daytime hours. Defendant also offered Plaintiff a one-time rent concession of approximately $100 for one month, which Plaintiff declined as inadequate. Despite notice and the offer of a small concession, Defendant has not curtailed or limited the construction to avoid substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises nor provided a reasonable remedy that adequately compensates or addresses the ongoing substantial interference.

11. The construction has been substantial and prolonged, and the nature, frequency, duration, and intensity of the disturbances—when measured against the purposes for which residential premises are occupied and Plaintiff’s reasonable expectations—constitute a material and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

12. Plaintiff has repeatedly asked Defendant to abate or reasonably mitigate the disturbance (including limiting the hours of noise, implementing dust control measures, providing alternative quiet workspace, providing meaningful temporary rent abatement, or pausing the work during particularly disruptive times). Defendant has failed to provide adequate relief.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and failures, Plaintiff has suffered economic loss, annoyance, loss of use and enjoyment, diminution in rental value, mental distress, and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial but reasonably estimated by Plaintiff to be approximately $3,000.00.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law — Massachusetts)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 13 as though fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes tenants the covenant of quiet enjoyment of leased premises; the covenant protects the tenant’s right to possession and use of the premises without substantial disturbance or interference by the landlord or others acting with the landlord’s authority. See generally Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 16.1–16.4 (discussion of covenant of quiet enjoyment) (authoritative statement of the common-law covenant); see also Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (warranty/covenant principles applied in residential context); Massachusetts cases recognizing landlord duties and tenant remedies under similar principles.

16. A breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs where a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially and unreasonably interfere with a tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises. Such interference may be the result of persistent, continuous, or repeated conduct that materially impairs the tenant’s ability to use the premises for their intended residential purpose. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 16.1; see also comparable Massachusetts authorities construing landlord obligations and tenant remedies.

17. Defendant, as landlord, has by permitting, continuing, and/or causing prolonged day-time construction (including drilling, hammering, and other loud work), failing to take reasonable corrective or mitigating measures, and providing only an inadequate one-time rent concession, materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and use of the Premises.

18. Defendant’s conduct was knowing, intentional, and/or the result of deliberate indifference to Plaintiff’s rights under the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in that Defendant was aware of the extent and duration of the disturbance, had the ability to take reasonable measures to mitigate the disturbance (including but not limited to restricting hours, providing effective dust-control measures, offering meaningful temporary relocation or rent abatement, or rescheduling particularly disruptive work), and failed to take such measures.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has incurred damages including, but not limited to, economic loss (diminished use and rental value), loss of quiet and peaceable enjoyment, emotional distress, inconvenience, and other compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial. Plaintiff reasonably estimates damages at approximately $3,000.00 based on loss of use, diminished habitability, and consequential impacts on Plaintiff’s ability to work from home.

20. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, along with costs, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

AUTHORITY AND LEGAL SUPPORT (Representative Statutes and Decisions)

Plaintiff relies upon the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized in Massachusetts, and upon statutory and case authorities governing landlord-tenant rights and remedies. Representative authorities include, without limitation:

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant; general landlord-tenant law and remedies)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process — for jurisdictional/summary process principles)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (General Laws governing unfair and deceptive acts — cited for context though no separate claim is pleaded)
- Mass. R. Civ. P. (applicable rules governing civil procedure in Massachusetts state courts)

Restatement and Secondary Authority
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 16.1–16.4 (covenant of quiet enjoyment; landlord remedies)
- 51 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant (general authority on breach of quiet enjoyment)

Select Case Law (illustrative authorities on covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord duties, and tenant remedies)
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (noting warranty/covenant principles in residential tenancies)
- New York cases and other federal decisions applying covenant principles (as persuasive authority where Massachusetts caselaw is in accord)
- Massachusetts decisions and appellate authorities interpreting landlord-tenant duties and tenant remedies under the covenant of quiet enjoyment (courts have long recognized that substantial and unreasonable interference—such as prolonged construction noise and intrusion—may constitute a breach)
- Restatement-based and Massachusetts appellate decisions considering noise/dust and prolonged disturbance as materially interfering with use and enjoyment of premises

(Planned authorities for trial and memoranda will include targeted Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court decisions and statutes directly on point; Plaintiff reserves the right to cite additional and more specific Massachusetts authority, including on nuisance and breach of quiet enjoyment, in pre-trial submissions and at trial.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Michael Richards as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial but reasonably estimated at $3,000.00 for loss of use, diminution of rental value, and other damages caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. For pre- and post-judgment interest on any monetary award as allowed by law;

C. For an injunction or equitable relief directing Defendant to take reasonable measures to abate, limit, or mitigate the construction disturbance (including, for example, limiting hours of the noisiest work, requiring dust-control measures, providing reasonable notice of particularly disruptive work, or offering temporary alternative accommodations) pending completion of the renovation, or, in the alternative, for an order providing meaningful temporary rent abatement or other reasonable accommodation while construction continues;

D. For Plaintiff’s costs of suit and any allowable attorneys’ fees (if applicable) and expenses; and

E. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.
