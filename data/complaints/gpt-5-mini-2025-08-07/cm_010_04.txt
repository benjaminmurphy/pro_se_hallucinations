Michael Johnson
Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
   1.1 Petitioner: Sarah Thompson (hereinafter "Petitioner"), contact information:
       Phone: (617) 555-0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com. Petitioner resides within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is a party to the custody order described below.
   1.2 Respondent: Michael Johnson (hereinafter "Respondent"). Respondent is the other parent of the minor child named below and is a party to the custody order described below.
   1.3 Minor Child: Emily Johnson, born in approximately 2015, presently ten (10) years old. Emily is the subject of the custody order described below.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter because the parties and the minor child reside in Massachusetts and because the existing custody order was entered in this Commonwealth.
   2.2 Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the existing order affecting custody was entered in this Court and the minor child resides in Middlesex County.

3. Existing Order
   3.1 On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody/parenting-time order (the "2018 Order") awarding primary physical residence of Emily Johnson to Respondent and awarding Petitioner limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner visit consistent with the factual representations below.
   3.2 A true and accurate copy of the 2018 Order is in the court file and is incorporated herein by reference.

4. Relief Requested
   4.1 Petitioner seeks modification of the 2018 Order to reflect the material change in circumstances set forth below and to establish a revised parenting plan that increases Petitioner’s residential time with Emily, including regular overnight parenting time and expanded weekday and weekend parenting time, as this Court finds to be in the best interests of the child.
   4.2 Specifically, Petitioner requests that the Court:
       a. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2018 Order;
       b. Modify the parties’ parenting plan and order to increase Petitioner’s residential time with Emily, including but not limited to regular weeknight and weekend overnight parenting time, or such other schedule as the Court deems appropriate for the child’s best interests;
       c. Enter any other orders necessary to effectuate the modified parenting schedule, including revisions to school pickup/drop-off, holiday schedules, and communication provisions; and
       d. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

5. Factual Allegations (Material Change in Circumstances)
   The Petitioner alleges the following facts, which together establish a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Order:
   5.1 At the time the 2018 Order was entered (May 15, 2018), Petitioner was enrolled in graduate school, living in a small studio apartment, and had a schedule that was not conducive to significant parenting time. Those circumstances were expressly relied upon by the parties and the Court in structuring the parenting-time allocation.
   5.2 Since entry of the 2018 Order, Petitioner has completed graduate school and obtained stable, full-time employment with normal daytime hours and a predictable schedule. Petitioner’s employment status now allows regular weekday and weekend availability to care for Emily.
   5.3 Petitioner now resides in a two-bedroom apartment in which Emily has her own private bedroom. Petitioner’s current living situation provides appropriate, safe, and stable accommodations for increased residential parenting time, including overnight stays.
   5.4 The child, Emily, is now ten (10) years old. Over the past years Emily and Petitioner have developed a close and nurturing parent-child relationship; Emily has expressed a desire for more time with Petitioner.
   5.5 Emily has been receiving therapy. Emily’s therapist has communicated to Petitioner that Emily experiences guilt when leaving Petitioner after short visits and has expressed a desire for increased overnight parenting time with Petitioner. The therapist believes that increased time with Petitioner would be beneficial to Emily’s emotional wellbeing. (Petitioner will offer the therapist’s written statement and/or affidavit and any required releases or records to the Court as permitted.)
   5.6 Emily has personally written a letter to the judge stating her preference to have more overnights with Petitioner. Petitioner will present the child’s written statement to the Court in accordance with the Court’s procedures and the child’s best interests.
   5.7 Respondent has refused to negotiate or agree to any modification of the parenting schedule and reacts angrily when Emily raises the subject, impeding informal resolution of this matter.
   5.8 These changed circumstances—Petitioner’s improved housing and financial stability, altered parental availability, and Emily’s expressed wishes and therapeutic recommendation—collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2018 Order that warrants modification in order to serve the child’s best interests.

6. Legal Standard
   6.1 Petitioner alleges that the foregoing facts satisfy the statutory and common-law standards applied by Massachusetts courts for modification of child custody/parenting-time orders: courts may modify an existing custody or parenting-time order upon a showing that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior order and that modification is in the best interests of the child.
   6.2 Petitioner will rely upon the applicable statutes, rules, and Massachusetts case law regarding modification of custody and parenting time in presenting this matter to the Court.

7. Reservation of Rights
   7.1 Petitioner reserves the right to seek any additional relief appropriate to the facts that come to light through discovery or at hearing, including but not limited to proposed detailed parenting plans, allocation of parental decision-making authority, child support calculations reflecting any change in primary residence or parenting time, and associated costs or attorney’s fees as allowed by law.

8. Notice to Respondent / Certificate of Service
   8.1 Petitioner will serve this Complaint, together with the summons and a copy of any supporting documentation available at the time of service, upon Respondent in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules and the Court’s procedures.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
   A. Find that Material Change in Circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2018 Order;
   B. Modify the 2018 Order to increase Petitioner’s residential/parenting time with Emily Johnson, including regular overnight time and expanded weekday/weekend time as the Court deems in the best interests of the child;
   C. Enter any additional orders necessary to implement the revised parenting schedule and to protect the child’s best interests; and
   D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

I, Sarah Thompson, declare under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
