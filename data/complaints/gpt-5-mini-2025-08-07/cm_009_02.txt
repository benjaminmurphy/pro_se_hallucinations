Mark Johnson

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Contact Information
   a. Plaintiff: Laura Smith, pro se
      Address: [address omitted — file with court per local rule]
      Phone: (617) 555-0123
      Email: psm1443@gmail.com
   b. Defendant: Mark Johnson
      Address: [address omitted — file with court per local rule]

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   a. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parental rights concerning the minor child pursuant to Massachusetts law and the Probate and Family Court’s continuing jurisdiction to enforce and modify child custody orders.
   b. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the relief requested concerns a child who resides in Barnstable County and the original custody order was entered in this Court on May 15, 2019.

3. Minor Child
   a. The child subject to this action is:
      - Emily Johnson, age 8.

4. Existing Order
   a. On May 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order providing that Plaintiff, Laura Smith, has primary custody of Emily Johnson.
   b. The order awarded Defendant, Mark Johnson, visitation/custody every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

5. Facts Constituting a Material Change in Circumstances
   a. At the time the 2019 order was entered, both parents resided in the same town; the midweek Wednesday overnight allowed by the order required a brief, approximately five-minute drive from the other parent’s residence to Emily’s school, and the Wednesday overnight did not meaningfully disrupt Emily’s school routine.
   b. Since entry of the 2019 order, Defendant has moved his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from Emily’s school and primary residence with Plaintiff.
   c. Despite the substantial change in geography, Defendant insists on and continues to exercise the Wednesday midweek overnight provided in the 2019 order.
   d. Defendant picks Emily up from school on Wednesdays, drives her approximately ninety miles to his residence in Cape Cod for the overnight, and then drives Emily back to the child’s school in the early morning hours on Thursday. On numerous occasions Emily has been awakened around 4:30 a.m. to begin the drive back so she can attend school on Thursday morning.
   e. As a direct and foreseeable result of these extended drives and early wake-ups, Emily has exhibited significant and ongoing fatigue. Emily’s classroom teacher has reported a noticeable drop in Emily’s participation and attentiveness on Thursdays since Defendant began exercising the Wednesday overnight from his Cape Cod residence.
   f. Emily’s exhaustion has been observed by Plaintiff and Emily’s teacher and is documented in school communications (available upon request), and such exhaustion materially interferes with Emily’s school performance, participation, and overall wellbeing.
   g. Plaintiff has attempted to address the issue with Defendant directly and to arrive at a parenting arrangement that minimizes disruption to Emily’s school routine, but Defendant has refused to modify his schedule or to refrain from the midweek overnight.
   h. The change in Defendant’s residence location, and the attendant effects on Emily’s sleep, school participation, and health constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 custody order.

6. Legal Basis for Relief
   a. Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody/visitation order based on a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests and welfare of the child and requests that the Court modify the order to eliminate the harmful midweek overnight and to adjust Defendant’s visitation schedule to avoid long drives on school nights.
   b. Plaintiff asserts that the requested modification is in Emily’s best interests because it will eliminate repeated early-morning long-distance travel that causes exhaustion and impairment of school functioning.

7. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order granting the following relief:

   a. Modify the existing custody/visitation order entered May 15, 2019 by eliminating the Wednesday midweek overnight currently awarded to Defendant, Mark Johnson; and
   b. Modify Defendant’s weekend custody so as to avoid long-distance travel that interrupts Emily’s school nights and mornings. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that Defendant’s parenting time be limited to:
      i. Every other weekend, Friday 6:00 p.m. to Sunday 6:00 p.m. (or such alternate reasonable hours as the Court deems appropriate), with local pick-up and return locations to minimize school-night disruption; and
      ii. No midweek overnight parent time that requires Emily to miss or be materially delayed/tired for school; and
      iii. Reasonable midweek contact by telephone or video calls on school nights, with in-person midweek parenting time limited to situations where overnight stays do not require early-morning travel that interferes with school.
   c. Alternatively, enter such temporary orders pending final hearing as the Court deems necessary to protect Emily’s health, safety, and educational interests, including immediate suspension of the Wednesday overnight pending a hearing on the merits.
   d. Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs and any other relief related to modification of the custody/parenting plan necessary to protect Emily’s best interests.

8. Notice of Hearing and Mediation
   a. Plaintiff is willing to participate in mediation or conciliation services and will cooperate with the Court’s requirements for alternative dispute resolution before trial if ordered by the Court.

9. Certificate of Service
   a. Plaintiff will serve a copy of this Complaint upon Defendant in accordance with the Rules of the Probate and Family Court and will file an appropriate proof of service with the Court.
