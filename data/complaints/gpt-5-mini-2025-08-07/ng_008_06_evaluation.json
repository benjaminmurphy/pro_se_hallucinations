Therefore it does not provide authority for the specific business-invitee duty proposition stated.",

In general, it means that kind and degree of care, which prudent and cautious men would use, such as is required by the exigency of the case, and such as is necessary to guard against probable danger.\""

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns substantial-factor causation and foreseeability in a slip\u2011and\u2011fall context (water and ice on a tiled walkway), but Palsgraf addresses a different issue: the scope of duty and foreseeability of harm to a remote plaintiff from an unforeseeable explosion. Cardozo\u2019s opinion expressly brackets off proximate-cause/consequence questions and focuses instead on whether there was any duty to the injured plaintiff at all. It therefore does not establish or affirm the specific principle that a defendant\u2019s breach is a substantial factor in causing, and makes foreseeable, harm from slipping on a wet/icy walkway.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort. We may assume, without deciding, that negligence, not at large or in the abstract, but in relation to the plaintiff, would entail liability for any and all consequences, however novel or extraordinary\u2026\u201d"
