COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE (Personal Injury)

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Julia Thompson, pro se, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Bargain Home Goods, Inc., alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Julia Thompson is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Bargain Home Goods, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation (or business doing business in Massachusetts) with a retail location at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852, where the incident described below occurred.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the negligence and resulting injury occurred at Defendant’s premises located in Lowell (Middlesex County).

4. This Complaint is filed within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A).

FACTS — COMMON ALLEGATIONS

5. On July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Bargain Home Goods, Inc., at its 123 Market Street, Lowell store as an invited customer (an invitee).

6. At the time and place alleged, Defendant displayed and stored heavy boxed merchandise (appliances and appliance boxes) stacked high on shelving units in customer aisles — approximately five or six boxes high — without adequate securing devices, straps, barriers, or other means to prevent displacement or falling of the boxes from upper shelves into the aisle.

7. As Plaintiff was looking at kitchen products in an aisle, another customer pushed a shopping cart down the aisle and, in the ordinary course of navigating the aisle, bumped a lower shelf. The impact was not forceful beyond normal shopping activity (a normal bump).

8. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s storage and display practices, a large boxed toaster-oven fell from near the top of the shelf and struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of her head.

9. Defendant’s store manager and staff responded at the scene. A store incident report was prepared by the manager and the manager offered Plaintiff a store coupon.

10. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a severe headache. That same evening her symptoms worsened and she sought emergency medical care at a local hospital emergency room.

11. Medical evaluation diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,800.00 in medical expenses as a result. Plaintiff, who works as a delivery driver, missed work and sustained approximately $600.00 in lost wages. Plaintiff was also unable to participate in her recreational soccer league for about one month.

12. Defendant’s acts and omissions as described herein were negligent and were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

13. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. As the owner/occupier and operator of a retail store open to the public and invitees, Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn of latent or concealed dangers known or discoverable in the exercise of reasonable care, and generally to protect invitees from foreseeable hazards. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 314A, 343; Mass. R. Civ. P. 8 (pleading duty and elements of negligence); cf. Brown v. Kendall (establishing the modern negligence standard), Donoghue v. Stevenson, Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co. (as authority on foreseeability and scope of duty).

15. Defendant breached that duty in multiple respects, including, without limitation:
   a. Failing to safely store and secure heavy boxed merchandise on shelving within customer aisles;
   b. Stacking heavy boxes at unsafe heights without straps, barriers, or other reasonably necessary safety devices;
   c. Failing to inspect, maintain, or otherwise ensure that shelving and storage methods posed no unreasonable risk to invitees; and
   d. Failing to provide adequate warnings or physical protections against foreseeable displacement of merchandise.

   Such breaches are negligent under established authorities recognizing a storeowner’s duty to protect invitees from hazards arising from the manner in which goods are stored and displayed. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 314A, 343; Prosser & Keeton on Torts; MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., Escola v. Coca‑Cola Bottling Co., Brown v. Kendall, Donoghue v. Stevenson.

16. Defendant’s breach was a proximate and direct cause of the large boxed toaster-oven falling from the shelf and striking Plaintiff. The harm to Plaintiff — head injury (concussion), shoulder strain, medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, and related losses — was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligent storage and maintenance of merchandise and failure to use reasonable precautions to protect invitees. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.; Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 402A (products/storage hazards and foreseeability).

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:
   a. Past medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,800.00 (approximately);
   b. Past lost earnings/wages in the approximate amount of $600.00 (approximately);
   c. Past and (if applicable) future pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined at trial;
   d. Any other economic and non-economic losses allowable by law; and
   e. Costs of suit and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

18. Plaintiff relies upon and invokes the following authorities and principles governing negligence and premises liability claims (including examples of leading authorities and treatises that define and explain duty, breach, causation, and damages):
   - Massachusetts General Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions);
   - Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure (Mass. R. Civ. P.) (pleading standards analogous to federal rules, e.g., Rule 8);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 314A, 343 (duty to protect invitees and liability for negligent failure to keep premises safe);
   - Brown v. Kendall (Mass. common-law formulation of negligence duty);
   - Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 (establishing duty of care principles);
   - Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability and scope of duty);
   - MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382 (1916) (duty and foreseeability in tort law);
   - Escola v. Coca‑Cola Bottling Co., 24 Cal.2d 453 (1944) (store/manufacturer liability principles);
   - Prosser & Keeton on Torts (treatise authority on negligence and premises liability);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A (as relevant to dangerous products/conditions).

   Plaintiff intends to rely on these authorities and such additional Massachusetts and other jurisdictional case law, statutes, jury instructions, Restatement provisions, and treatises as may be applicable and helpful at trial.

B. Costs of suit and interest as allowed by law;

C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
