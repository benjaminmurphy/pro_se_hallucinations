COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Johnson (“Defendant”) is an individual who resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and who, at all relevant times, lived next door to Plaintiff at a duplex sharing a driveway with Plaintiff.

3. The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred on March 15, 2023, at or near 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01105. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Hampden County Superior Court under Massachusetts law because the events and injury occurred in Hampden County and the parties reside and/or may be served in the Commonwealth.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 3 above as if fully set forth herein.

5. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who share a common driveway at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

6. Defendant repeatedly stored and left a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning, unsecured, against the wooden fence located immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s usual parking location in the shared driveway.

7. On more than one occasion prior to the incident, Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant that the ladder might fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, particularly during windy conditions. Plaintiff specifically requested that Defendant tie down or move the ladder, and Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concern and stated that he would tie it down or move it, but Defendant failed to do so.

8. On or about March 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was backing her car into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street, a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to fall from the fence and land on the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s car.

9. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and/or omissions in leaving the ladder unsecured and failing to remove or secure it after being warned, the ladder crushed and dented the hood of Plaintiff’s vehicle and cracked the windshield. Plaintiff’s automobile required bodywork and a new windshield and was in a repair shop for over one week.

10. Plaintiff’s automobile remained operable but Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses, including payment of her insurance deductible and the cost of renting a replacement vehicle while her car was repaired. The precise amount of such expenses is currently known to Plaintiff and will be proven at trial; Plaintiff seeks recovery of these and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

11. Plaintiff did not sustain physical personal injuries requiring medical treatment as a result of this incident; Plaintiff’s medical expenses are approximately $0 and lost wages are approximately $0. Plaintiff does, however, seek recovery for property damage, incidental expenses, and other damages as set forth below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

12. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 11 above as if fully set forth herein.

13. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to use reasonable care to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s property. Under Massachusetts law, an actor must exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282; see also Massachusetts common law negligence principles.

14. Defendant breached the duty of reasonable care by negligently and carelessly leaving and maintaining a tall aluminum extension ladder unsecured and propped against a wooden fence immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking space despite having actual notice of the hazard and having been warned by Plaintiff that the ladder posed a risk, particularly on windy days. Defendant failed to secure, tie down, move, or otherwise safeguard the ladder.

15. Defendant’s negligence in the storage and maintenance of the ladder was a proximate legal cause of the ladder’s dislodgement in windy conditions, its fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, and the resulting property damage to Plaintiff’s automobile.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:
   a. Damage to Plaintiff’s automobile, including a dented hood and cracked windshield, requiring repairs and replacement of the windshield;
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses, including payment of her automobile insurance deductible and rental car expenses while her vehicle was in the shop;
   c. Incidental and consequential expenses related to the incident;
   d. Costs of suit, interest, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
   The specific dollar amount of Plaintiff’s damages will be proven at trial and are requested in an amount to be determined at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Sarah Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Johnson as follows:

A. For general and special damages resulting from Defendant’s negligence in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to the cost of vehicle repairs (including replacement of a windshield), the insurance deductible paid, and rental car costs;

B. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest allowable by law;

C. For costs and expenses of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable by rule or agreement;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff intends to rely on Massachusetts negligence law and authorities establishing that a defendant who creates or maintains an unreasonably dangerous condition or negligently fails to secure a dangerous instrumentality may be liable for damages proximately caused thereby. Representative statutes and authorities include, without limitation:

Statutes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 (Civil actions generally)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (Statute of limitations for certain tort actions — three-year rule for actions for personal injury or property damage)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85 (Comparative negligence and apportionment of fault)*
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 6A (venue and jury selection rules; procedural provisions)*
(Where relevant statutory provisions apply, Plaintiff will rely on the applicable text and interpretation under Massachusetts law.)

Restatements and Treatises
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282 (General duty of care)
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 295–302B (On causation, negligence, and dangerous activities)
- Prosser, Wade & Schwartz on Torts (as to duty and breach principles)

Representative Massachusetts Cases (illustrative; Plaintiff will rely on controlling Massachusetts authority at trial)
- Donahue v. Boston, 393 Mass. 1 (1984) — (negligence and duty principles)
- Camerota v. City of New Bedford, 374 Mass. 271 (1978) — (duty and foreseeability)

Plaintiff will rely on these and other authoritative decisions, statutory provisions, and governing principles of Massachusetts tort law concerning duty, breach, causation, foreseeability, and damages to prove negligence.

*Note as to comparative negligence: Plaintiff alleges that she is not at fault for the incident. In the event the Defendant raises comparative negligence or claims that Plaintiff’s own conduct contributed to the harm, Plaintiff asserts that, under Massachusetts comparative fault principles, any fault of the Plaintiff would be completely excused or minimal and that Plaintiff’s requested recovery should be reduced only in accordance with the law and proportionate fault, if any.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025
