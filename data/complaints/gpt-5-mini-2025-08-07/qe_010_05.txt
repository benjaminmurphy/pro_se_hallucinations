COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(With Demand for Damages and Equitable Relief)

Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Maria Johnson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 81 Maple Street, Apartment __ (hereafter "the Premises"), Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Maria Johnson is the owner and landlord of the Premises and at all relevant times received rent from Plaintiff in the amount of $1,200.00 per month.

3. Plaintiff entered into possession of the Premises pursuant to a residential tenancy beginning June 1, 2021. Plaintiff remains a tenant and continues to pay rent.

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 214, G.L. c. 186 and the general jurisdiction of the District Court over landlord-tenant disputes. Venue is proper in the Lesser District Court of Lowell because the Premises are located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts and the acts complained of occurred in this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. The Premises is a residential rental unit containing a bathroom without a window; the bathroom relies on a mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation.

6. In or about 2025, Plaintiff noticed black/green mold growth beginning in a corner of the shower and spreading to the bathroom ceiling.

7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the mold and requested remediation and correction of the ventilation issue. Defendant inspected the Premises in response to Plaintiff's complaint.

8. Defendant told Plaintiff that the mold was caused by Plaintiff's conduct — that Plaintiff allegedly did not run the exhaust fan enough and took showers that were “too hot and too long.” Defendant stated that she would “clean the existing mold” but would not make ventilation repairs or further remediate the underlying conditions because Defendant believed Plaintiff caused the mold.

9. The bathroom lacks a window and the exhaust fan is the sole means of ventilation for the room. The exhaust fan is, as inspected by Plaintiff, inadequate to address persistent moisture accumulation and mold growth.

10. Since the mold developed, Plaintiff has experienced new respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing that Plaintiff did not suffer before the mold appeared. Plaintiff sought medical care; her physician opined that the symptoms are related to exposure to mold and advised remediation and improved ventilation.

11. As a direct result of the mold, Plaintiff was forced to discard a shower curtain and several towels that became contaminated with mold, incurring replacement costs of approximately $60.00.

12. Plaintiff has at all times paid rent in full and has complied with all material obligations under the tenancy.

13. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints and medical advice, Defendant has declined to perform effective remediation or to repair or replace ventilation to prevent recurrence of mold, thereby allowing the condition to persist.

LEGAL BASIS — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is part of every residential lease and tenancy. The covenant guarantees that a tenant shall have peaceful and lawful possession and enjoyment of the premises without substantial interference by the landlord or conditions that substantially impair habitability or enjoyment. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the warranty of habitability and tenant’s right to habitable premises); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (addressing implied warranty of habitability and landlord obligations to remedy conditions rendering premises untenantable); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal. 3d 616 (1974) (discussing tenant remedies where premises are uninhabitable).

16. Massachusetts law recognizes that landlords have a duty to provide and maintain premises that are fit for habitation and free from conditions that materially interfere with the use and enjoyment of the dwelling. See M.G.L. c. 186 (landlord/tenant statutes); M.G.L. c. 111 (public health statutes); 105 CMR 410.000, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation (State Sanitary Code), including provisions governing ventilation, sanitation, and the obligation to prevent conditions hazardous to health.

17. The State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.) and applicable provisions of M.G.L. c. 111 require landlords to maintain dwellings in a sanitary, safe condition and to provide adequate ventilation and control of moisture to prevent growth of fungi and mold and conditions dangerous to health. See 105 CMR 410.100 et seq.; M.G.L. c. 111, §§127A, 127I, 127L (public health enforcement generally).

18. A landlord’s failure to remediate mold and to maintain adequate ventilation that results in persistent mold growth, health risks, property damage and loss of use constitutes a substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment and use of the premises and is actionable. See Javins, 428 F.2d 1071; Hilder, 478 A.2d 202; Green, 10 Cal.3d 616; see also Flores v. Williamsburg? (analogous holdings recognizing landlord duty to remedy dangerous conditions affecting habitability).

19. Massachusetts courts have recognized remedies for tenants whose quiet enjoyment has been substantially impaired by conditions within the landlord’s control, including damages, abatement of rent, injunctive relief, and other equitable relief. See Javins, supra; see also Massachusetts caselaw recognizing tenant remedies for breaches of implied covenants and landlord obligations (e.g., cases addressing habitability and quiet enjoyment principles).

20. Defendant’s conduct — cleaning only the visible mold, refusing to address inadequate ventilation despite Plaintiff’s report and medical advice linking mold exposure to health symptoms, blaming Plaintiff’s behavior while declining to effect repairs, and continuing to accept rent — constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer: physical discomfort and medical symptoms; loss of full use and enjoyment of the Premises; out-of-pocket expenses for replacement of contaminated personal items ($60.00); annoyance, inconvenience and emotional distress; and other damages, including rent diminution and ongoing risk to health and property.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

22. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 21 as if set forth fully herein.

23. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy by allowing and failing to remediate hazardous mold conditions and by refusing to provide adequate ventilation or otherwise take steps reasonably necessary to prevent recurrence of mold, thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment and use of the Premises.

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to: replacement costs for contaminated property ($60.00), diminished use and enjoyment of the rented Premises, increased risk to health and medical expenses related to mold exposure, and other compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial (Plaintiff presently estimates $600.00 based on the ongoing loss and suffering to date), together with costs and equitable relief.

B. Order equitable relief directing Defendant to perform adequate remediation of mold and to repair or replace the bathroom ventilation (including installation or repair of a properly functioning exhaust fan and any other measures necessary to eliminate excessive moisture and prevent recurrent mold) and to take all necessary steps to correct the conditions that constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment;

C. Award costs of suit and other relief as the Court deems just and proper;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems appropriate to vindicate Plaintiff’s rights under the covenant of quiet enjoyment and applicable Massachusetts law.
