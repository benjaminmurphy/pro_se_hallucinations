      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Paragraphs 4(d)\u2013(f), 5(a) and the requested relief in 6 tie the alleged change (sleep deprivation, reduced classroom participation) to the child\u2019s health, education and welfare and seek relief to stop the harmful midweek travel. Those allegations sufficiently plead that the proposed modification is necessary in the child\u2019s best interests."
