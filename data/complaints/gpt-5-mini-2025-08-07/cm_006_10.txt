Michael Johnson
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   1.1. Plaintiff: Jessica Thompson, telephone (617) 555-0123, email psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant: Michael Johnson.
   1.3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law and the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody orders. Venue is proper in Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the parties and the children reside or are subject to orders enforced in Norfolk County and because the existing custody order was entered in this Court.

2. Background and Existing Order
   2.1. Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of two minor children: Liam (born 2017; age 8) and Ava (born 2019; age 6).
   2.2. On May 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody/parenting order awarding Plaintiff primary physical custody of Liam and Ava and granting Defendant alternate weekends and one midweek visit (the “Existing Order”).
   2.3. At the time the Existing Order was entered neither party was in a serious relationship; the judgment does not address or restrict the presence of new partners in the home or during parenting time.

3. Nature of the Motion
   3.1. Plaintiff brings this Complaint for Modification of Custody, seeking an Order modifying the Existing Order because there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the judgment that affects the children’s safety and welfare.

4. Facts Supporting Modification—Material Change in Circumstances
   4.1. Since entry of the Existing Order Defendant has begun a cohabiting relationship with an adult who now resides in Defendant’s home (hereinafter the “Resident Partner”).
   4.2. Plaintiff has learned the Resident Partner has a prior criminal conviction for assault and battery and was subject to a prior restraining order obtained by a former romantic partner. (Plaintiff is prepared to provide documentation and testimony regarding the conviction and restraining order.)
   4.3. The children have reported to Plaintiff that the Resident Partner frequently yells loudly in the home, slams doors, and has engaged in physically aggressive conduct in the presence of the children.
   4.4. On one occasion the children reported the Resident Partner grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm. Plaintiff will seek to present pictures and the child’s testimony at hearing.
   4.5. A neighbor called police to Defendant’s residence during a loud argument while the children were present. Plaintiff will seek to present police reports and any available records at hearing.
   4.6. The circumstances described in paragraphs 4.2–4.5 constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances that occurred after entry of the Existing Order and raise serious concern for the physical safety and emotional wellbeing of the children while they are in proximity to the Resident Partner.

5. Legal Basis for Relief
   5.1. The best interests of the children is the guiding legal standard for custody and visitation decisions. Plaintiff requests the Court find that the change in circumstances is material and substantial and warrants modification of the Existing Order to protect the children’s safety and welfare.
   5.2. Plaintiff alleges that the reported conduct of the Resident Partner—given the criminal history, prior restraining order, aggressive incidents in the home, and a reported incident of physical contact that left a mark—creates an unacceptable risk to the children if the Resident Partner is present during unsupervised parenting time and that modification is necessary to ensure the children’s safety.
   5.3. In addition to the Court’s power to modify custody orders to protect children’s welfare, statutory and public-safety obligations such as the child abuse and neglect reporting statute (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A) and the Domestic Abuse Protection Act (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A) provide context for the Court’s authority and responsibility to address risks to children and caretakers.
   5.4. Plaintiff will request that the Court exercise its authority to fashion appropriate relief, including restriction or supervision of Defendant’s parenting time, to avoid exposing the children to the Resident Partner’s presence if the Court concludes the Resident Partner poses a risk to the children.

6. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:
   6.1. A determination that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2021 custody order that warrants modification of the Existing Order.
   6.2. A modification of the Existing Order providing that:
        a. The Resident Partner shall not be present in the home or otherwise physically present during any unsupervised parenting time between Defendant and the children; OR, in the alternative,
        b. All parenting time for Defendant shall be supervised until further order of the Court (supervisor to be a Court-approved third party or other person approved by Plaintiff and the Court), with the specifics of supervision to be determined by the Court; AND/OR,
        c. Interim restrictions on Defendant’s unsupervised parenting time pending a full hearing on the merits, if the Court finds interim relief appropriate to protect the children.
   6.3. An order directing Defendant to provide Plaintiff and the Court with the name, address, date of birth, and relevant criminal history of the Resident Partner and to produce any documents relating to the Resident Partner’s prior criminal conviction and restraining order.
   6.4. An order authorizing Plaintiff to request and obtain any police reports, 51A filings, or other records relevant to incidents occurring at Defendant’s residence.
   6.5. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper, including attorney’s fees and costs if appropriate.

7. Interim Relief
   7.1. Given the allegations of recent physical contact and the prior criminal history and restraining order involving the Resident Partner, Plaintiff requests that the Court consider interim protective measures (such as temporarily suspending unsupervised parenting time or ordering supervised visits) pending a hearing on this Complaint to prevent imminent risk to the children.

8. Notice and Opportunity to be Heard
   8.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this matter and provide notice to Defendant in accordance with the Rules of the Probate and Family Court so that Defendant may respond and be heard.

9. Verification
   9.1. Pursuant to applicable rules, Plaintiff will verify this Complaint under oath at the time of filing or as required by the Court.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an Order modifying the Existing Order as requested herein to protect the safety and welfare of Liam and Ava, grant interim relief as necessary, and award such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

Notes and Legal Authorities (representative statutory authorities and legal principles)
- Best interests standard and the court’s authority to modify custody and visitation to protect a child’s welfare: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28 (statutory provisions governing custody in actions for divorce and related proceedings; courts apply best-interests analysis and may modify orders upon change in circumstances).
- Domestic Abuse Prevention Act: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (protective orders; courts consider history of family or domestic violence in custody/visitation determinations).
- Child abuse reporting statute: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect; relevance to evidence and Court’s obligations).
- Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA): Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (jurisdictional rules for child custody determinations).
- Probate and Family Court authority to issue interim orders to protect children’s safety and to tailor supervised visitation or restrict third-party contact when warranted (court rules and practice under the Probate and Family Court).
- Courts commonly require modification be based on a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the existing order; under that standard the Court may modify custody or visitation where a new partner’s presence poses risk to a child’s safety or wellbeing.
- Law enforcement and child welfare involvement (police reports, 51A filings, restraining orders, criminal convictions) are relevant to the Court’s assessment of risk and appropriate remedial measures.

If you would like, I can:
- Add a proposed interim order form and proposed specific modifications (sample language for supervised visitation, restrictions on third-party presence, or requirements to disclose criminal history).
- Draft a completed Certificate of Service in the format required by the Norfolk Probate and Family Court (with method of service specified).
- Prepare a separate Motion for Temporary Restraining Order or Interim Relief if you want immediate specific relief pending a full hearing.

Important: I am not a lawyer. This is a pro se complaint template only. You should consider having an attorney or the Court’s self-help resources review any final documents before filing. If you want, I can draft the more detailed proposed order language and proposed findings for the Court to consider, or prepare a short affidavit verifying the factual allegations above for filing with the Complaint.
