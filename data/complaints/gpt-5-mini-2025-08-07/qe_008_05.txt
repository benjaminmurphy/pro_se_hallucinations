COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Smith, and hereby brings this Complaint against Defendant Emily Johnson, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an individual and a resident of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com. Plaintiff rents an apartment located at 24 Chelsea St, Chelsea, MA 02150 (the “Premises”).
2. Defendant Emily Johnson is the owner and landlord of the building in which the Premises are located and may be served at her residence or principal place of business in Chelsea, Massachusetts.
3. Plaintiff began renting the Premises from Defendant on or about June 1, 2022, pursuant to a periodic tenancy under which Plaintiff pays $1,500 per month in rent.
4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Chelsea, Massachusetts and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Chelsea. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process; venue provisions for real property actions); see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-and-tenant provisions).

FACTS
5. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
6. Beginning at least two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the main entry door to the building in which the Premises are located has had a broken lock. The door does not latch properly and may be pushed open by passersby; it does not secure the common areas of the building.
7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the broken main entry door lock approximately two months ago and requested repair. Defendant responded that she would fix the lock but did not do so. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the needed repair on at least two separate occasions; Defendant failed and refused to repair the lock.
8. As a direct result of the broken lock and Defendant’s failure to repair it, unknown persons gained access to the building last month and went through resident mail and packages left in the hallway. Several tenants had packages stolen. Plaintiff’s package, which had an approximate value of $120, was stolen from the hallway.
9. Plaintiff also has found evidence of unauthorized persons sleeping in the building basement, which has caused Plaintiff to reasonably fear for his/her personal safety and to suffer a loss of the reasonably expected enjoyment, use, safety, and privacy of the Premises.
10. To protect himself/herself and reduce the risk to personal safety, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for his/her apartment door and purchased and installed a better deadbolt on his/her unit door. Those out-of-pocket expenses totaled approximately $200.
11. Plaintiff repeatedly communicated concerns about safety and the unsecured entry to Defendant, but Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns as “overreacting” and indicated that the neighborhood is safe. Defendant nevertheless refused to take prompt remedial action to secure the building’s common entry.
12. Defendant’s conduct and omissions — including the failure to repair a known defective and insecure building entry lock and to otherwise secure the building common areas — materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, invaded Plaintiff’s privacy and security, exposed Plaintiff to theft and the presence of unauthorized persons in the building, and deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment to which Plaintiff is entitled as a tenant.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts common law)
13. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–12 as if set forth fully herein.
14. Under Massachusetts law, a tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment of leased premises and the landlord has an obligation not to materially interfere with that right. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every tenancy and protects tenants from landlord conduct that substantially interferes with or deprives the tenant of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071, 1076–77 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant protections against defects affecting habitability and enjoyment); Restatement (Second) of Property § 16.1 (establishing landlord duty of quiet enjoyment); see also Massachusetts authorities recognizing tenants’ rights to habitable and secure premises and landlords’ duties to maintain safe conditions and reasonable security for common areas; see generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord/tenant relations) and the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.).
15. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by (a) failing to repair the defective main entry lock after notice; (b) failing to secure common areas and take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized persons from entering and occupying building areas (including the basement); and (c) otherwise permitting conditions that foreseeably resulted in theft of mail and packages and created a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and a threat to Plaintiff’s safety.
16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered actual damages, including:
   a. the loss of Plaintiff’s package (approximate value $120);
   b. out-of-pocket expenses for security measures and a deadbolt ($200);
   c. emotional distress, fear for safety, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; and
   d. costs and other damages as may be proven at trial.
17. Plaintiff reasonably calculates recoverable damages directly resulting from the breach to be $320 (the $120 stolen-package loss plus $200 in security/deadbolt expenses). Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional damages for emotional distress, diminution of rental value, or other losses if supported by the evidence.
18. Plaintiff further seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to require Defendant to repair and maintain the main entry lock and to implement reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized entry and ensure the safety of building residents.
19. Plaintiff also seeks costs, pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent allowed by law, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (representative)
20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties are grounded in Massachusetts law, state regulations, and persuasive authority recognizing landlords’ obligations to maintain safe and usable premises and to remedy conditions that materially interfere with tenants’ enjoyment. Relevant authorities include, but are not limited to:
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and tenant law) (general provisions governing landlord and tenant obligations);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary process; venue and matters affecting possession of real property);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2 (Prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices) (tenant may assert consumer-protection claims in appropriate circumstances);
   - 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) (standards for safe and sanitary housing conditions);
   - Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenants’ rights in the context of habitability and implied covenants);
   - Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord & Tenant) §§ 5.1, 16.1 (landlord’s duty to provide quiet enjoyment and not to interfere);
   - See also cases and authorities recognizing landlord responsibilities for common-area security and tenant protection against foreseeable criminal activity caused by negligent building conditions (see, e.g., cases addressing landlord liability for failure to provide reasonable security measures and for interference with quiet enjoyment).
   (Plaintiff will provide pinpoint citations and additional Massachusetts caselaw to the Court and Defendant at or before trial; Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to take judicial notice of applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant as follows:
A. Award monetary damages to Plaintiff in the amount of at least $320 for the stolen package and security/deadbolt expenses, plus additional compensatory damages proven at trial for loss of use, emotional distress, and any other damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach;
B. Issue injunctive relief directing Defendant to repair or replace the main entry door lock and take reasonable measures to secure the building’s common areas (including reasonable security measures for the basement and mail/package areas) within fourteen (14) days of entry of judgment, and to maintain such measures thereafter;
C. Award costs of suit, filing fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;
D. Award any other relief that the Court deems just and appropriate, including declaratory relief that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment; and
E. Award attorneys’ fees if and to the extent permitted by statute or law (Plaintiff also requests any statutory remedies available under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A if Plaintiff elects to amend or supplement this pleading after counsel review).

JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
