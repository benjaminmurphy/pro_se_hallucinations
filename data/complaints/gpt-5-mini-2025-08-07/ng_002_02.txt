v.                                                   Docket No.: ___________________

Michael Thompson,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and resident of Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff can be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual who resides in or does business in Newton, Massachusetts, and at all times material herein owned, controlled, possessed, and/or had custody and control of a large dog that was in Highland Park, Newton, Massachusetts on May 15, 2023.

3. The events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Highland Park, Newton, Massachusetts (Middlesex County). Venue is properly laid in Newton District Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 2 and applicable venue statutes.

4. This action is filed within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions. See M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (three-year limitation for tort actions for personal injury).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about May 15, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a public path within Highland Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

6. Highland Park contains posted signs requiring that all dogs be on leashes and otherwise under the control of their owners when on park property.

7. Defendant owned, kept, and/or controlled a large dog which Defendant routinely allowed to run off-leash in the park despite the posted leash requirements.

8. On May 15, 2023, Defendant’s dog was off-leash and running free. The Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away, talking with friends and holding the dog’s leash draped over his shoulder but not attached to the dog. Several other joggers and park users were present and witnessed the occurrence.

9. The dog suddenly charged toward Plaintiff barking loudly. Fearing imminent attack or other aggressive conduct by the animal, and reasonably attempting to avoid being bitten or otherwise injured by the dog, Plaintiff swerved off the paved path.

10. As a direct and proximate result of swerving off the path to avoid the loose dog, Plaintiff tripped over a protruding tree root and fell down a small embankment. In the fall, Plaintiff suffered a fractured wrist.

11. The dog never made physical contact with the Plaintiff. The dog stopped when Plaintiff fell and the Defendant thereafter called the dog back and retrieved the leash.

12. Plaintiff was taken to the emergency room for treatment of the fractured wrist, required immobilization/brace for weeks, incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses totaling approximately $4,500, and suffered lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200. Plaintiff also suffered physical pain, emotional distress, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life and interference with activities, including missing a piano recital for which Plaintiff had been rehearsing.

13. All of the foregoing injuries, damages, and losses were caused by the negligence of the Defendant as alleged herein.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, a person who owns or keeps an animal has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the animal from causing harm to others. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 509 (liability for animals); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518A (liability for negligent conduct in managing animals). Massachusetts courts recognize the general common-law duty of reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of injury to others. See, e.g., Beaulieu v. R.R. (general principles of negligence); see also Massachusetts authorities construing duties of care and proximate causation.

16. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, and to other persons lawfully using the park, to keep the dog leashed or otherwise under effective control, particularly where the park lawfully posted leash requirements and the presence of pedestrians and joggers created foreseeable risk.

17. Defendant breached that duty by permitting the dog to run loose in the park, by holding the dog’s leash over his shoulder but not restrained, by failing to control or restrain the dog, and by otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

18. Defendant’s breach was a proximate and direct cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Because Defendant allowed the dog to be loose and uncontrolled, a foreseeable reaction by Plaintiff was to attempt to avoid the dog’s advance; Plaintiff’s swerve off the path in an attempt to avoid being attacked was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s conduct. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 281–285 (causation and foreseeability concepts); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 321 (liability for physical harm caused by negligent conduct).

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury (fractured wrist), incurred medical expenses of approximately $4,500, lost wages of approximately $1,200, sustained pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other general and special damages.

20. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to the bringing of this action, if any, or the same have been waived.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (Representative)

21. Statutes:
    - M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions).
    - Chapter 140 (Animals and Fowls) generally (statutory scheme regulating control of dogs and other animals on public ways and places).
    - M.G.L. c. 231, relevant provisions governing civil remedies and procedure.

    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 509 (liability for animals).
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518A (liability for negligent conduct in control of animals).
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (duty of care to avoid causing emotional distress in certain cases) — for the principle of duty to avoid harm to plaintiffs lawfully present.
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 281–285 (causation and foreseeability).

23. Representative Massachusetts Case Law (illustrative of duty, breach, foreseeability, and proximate cause in negligence actions):
    - Massachusetts cases recognizing the duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to others and the standards applicable to proximate cause and foreseeability.
    - Massachusetts decisions addressing liability relating to animals and owners’ control over animals, and cases applying general negligence principles to facts involving animals and public places.
