COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
Suffolk County Superior Court

Jason Miller,
    Plaintiff,

v.                                                    Civil Action No. __________

Rideshare Solutions, Inc.,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE
(Jury Trial Demanded)

1.      Parties

1.1     Plaintiff Jason Miller (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2     Defendant Rideshare Solutions, Inc. (“Defendant”) is a corporation doing business in Massachusetts and operating a rideshare service that employs, contracts with, or otherwise controls drivers who provide passenger transportation and related services in Boston and elsewhere in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Defendant was registered to do business and was conducting business in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2.      Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.

2.2     Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court because the acts and omissions complained of occurred at or near 418 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, which is in Suffolk County.

3.      Factual Allegations

3.1     On September 10, 2023, at approximately [time not known to Plaintiff], Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiff was wearing a bicycle helmet, traveling in the direction of traffic, and following all applicable traffic laws and safety rules.

3.2     At or near 418 Commonwealth Avenue, a vehicle operated by an individual who was then acting as a driver for Rideshare Solutions, Inc. ("the driver") was legally parked in a curbside loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bike lane.

3.3     Without checking for oncoming bicyclists in the bike lane, and without looking in the side mirror or over his shoulder, the driver of the Defendant’s vehicle opened the driver-side door into the bike lane while Plaintiff was lawfully passing the parked vehicle on his bicycle.

3.4     The door was opened suddenly and widely and struck Plaintiff’s bicycle and Plaintiff before Plaintiff had any possibility of stopping, swerving, or otherwise avoiding contact. Plaintiff was thrown from his bicycle and struck the pavement.

3.5     At the scene the driver admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone. Plaintiff subsequently filed a claim with the driver’s insurance company; the insurance company later reported that the driver told them that Plaintiff had been “weaving in and out of traffic,” a statement that Plaintiff denies and disputes.

3.6     As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s driver’s actions, Plaintiff sustained injuries including road rash to his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bicycle frame. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500.00 in medical and dental expenses and lost approximately $600.00 in wages due to time away from work. Plaintiff also incurred other economic losses and property damage from the loss or impairment of his bicycle. Plaintiff continues to suffer pain, inconvenience, and emotional distress and may incur additional medical and other expenses in the future.

3.7     At all times relevant hereto, the driver was acting within the scope of his employment with, or as an agent of, Defendant, or was otherwise subject to Defendant’s right of control, and Defendant is therefore vicariously liable for the negligence of its driver under principles of respondeat superior and agency.

4.      Cause of Action — Negligence (Against Defendant)

4.1     Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1.1 through 3.7 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2     At all times relevant to this action, Defendant and/or its driver owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of others using the roadway, including bicyclists lawfully occupying a marked bike lane. See, e.g., general principles of negligence and duties to avoid causing foreseeable harm (see Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 302B, 324A).

4.3     Defendant and/or its driver breached that duty by, among other things:
        (a) opening the vehicular door into an occupied and marked bike lane without first checking for approaching bicyclists and traffic;
        (b) failing to look, check mirrors, or otherwise verify that opening the door would be safe before opening it;
        (c) operating the vehicle and otherwise acting in a careless and negligent manner by attending to a cell phone rather than the street and bike lane; and
        (d) otherwise failing to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable person in the same position would have exercised under the circumstances.

4.4     Defendant’s and/or its driver’s conduct was a proximate cause of the injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiff. The risk that a person opening a motor vehicle door into an adjacent bike lane would strike and injure a passing bicyclist was foreseeable. See, e.g., Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause principles); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 431–435 (causation); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm § 7 (2010).

4.5     As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s and/or its driver’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered economic and non‑economic damages, including but not limited to:
        (a) past medical and dental expenses of approximately $1,500.00;
        (b) lost wages of approximately $600.00;
        (c) property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle and bicycle frame (cost to repair or replace to be proven at trial);
        (d) past and future physical pain and suffering;
        (e) past and future emotional distress; and
        (f) other damages to be proven at trial.

4.6     Under well-settled Massachusetts law, an employer or principal may be held vicariously liable for the torts of its employees or agents committed within the scope of employment or agency. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219; and cases applying respondeat superior principles.

5.      Demand for Jury Trial

5.1     Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

6.      Applicable Law and Authorities

6.1     Plaintiff relies on the following (non‑exhaustive) legal authorities to support the elements of duty, breach, causation, and damages in this negligence action:
        - Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 90 (Rules of the Road) (see generally provisions governing motor vehicle operation and obligations to other road users);
        - M.G.L. c. 260 (statute of limitations and related procedural provisions);
        - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 302B, 324A (duty, breach, and liability for acts creating unreasonable risk);
        - Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm § 7 (causation and scope of liability);
        - Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause);
        - MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382 (1916) (duty principles);
        - Other Massachusetts precedent establishing duty and vicarious liability principles (see, e.g., cases construing the scope of employer liability and negligence under Massachusetts law and decisions applying traditional negligence elements to roadway conduct).

(For purposes of the Complaint, Plaintiff cites the Restatements and controlling Massachusetts negligence principles and will rely on applicable Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and caselaw at trial and in briefing. Plaintiff respectfully reserves the right to supplement and particularize legal authorities in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, court rules, and local practice.)
