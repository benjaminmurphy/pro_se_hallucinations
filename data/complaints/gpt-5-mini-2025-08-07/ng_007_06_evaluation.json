It does not address premises liability, duties of proprietors/occupiers, supervision of persons on premises, or dangerous property conditions. Accordingly, it does not provide authority for the negligence-based duty principles described in the proposition and is mis-cited for that purpose.",

The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress these nails was denied on the grounds that the defendant had abandoned the premises, that the police had obtained valid consent to be on the premises, and that the defendant lacked standing to contest the search and seizure."

The court analyzes whether Otis is barred from asserting a litigation position inconsistent with his prior successful position; it does not discuss or establish any principles about landowner or proprietor duties, supervision, or dangerous conditions on premises. Citing Kosim v. Legacy for such a duty/breach proposition is therefore inaccurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cJudicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes a party from asserting a position in one legal proceeding that is contrary to a position it had previously asserted in another proceeding. \u2026 The purpose of the doctrine is to prevent the manipulation of the judicial process by litigants.\u201d (443 Mass. at 640)."
