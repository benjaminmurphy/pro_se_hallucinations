COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Premises — Lowell, Massachusetts)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 or psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Laura Bennett (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Premises”), and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a lease for the Premises, and Plaintiff has occupied the Premises as a residential tenant since January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.
1.4 Venue is proper in Lowell District Court because the Premises are located in Lowell and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

2. Facts
2.1 Beginning in or about late 2024, Plaintiff observed black/dark mold growth in the corner of the shower in the bathroom of the Premises. Over time the mold spread onto the bathroom ceiling.
2.2 The bathroom has no operable window; the only mechanical ventilation is an exhaust fan.
2.3 Plaintiff reported the mold to Defendant. Defendant inspected the bathroom in or about [approximately late 2024 — date of initial inspection], acknowledged the presence of mold, but told Plaintiff that the mold was caused by Plaintiff’s alleged failure to run the exhaust fan “enough” and by Plaintiff taking showers that were “too hot and too long.” Defendant refused to undertake any substantial ventilation or remediation measures other than offering to “clean” visible mold.
2.4 Plaintiff does run the exhaust fan when she showers, although she admits not every single shower may have the fan run for the entire time. Plaintiff reasonably uses the bathroom and takes normal showers; her showering practices are not unusual.
2.5 Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced new and persistent respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing. Plaintiff did not have these symptoms prior to the mold’s appearance. Plaintiff sought medical care and her treating physician advised that the symptoms were likely related to mold exposure and that remediation of the mold was medically recommended.
2.6 As a direct result of the mold, Plaintiff discarded a shower curtain and several towels that were contaminated, resulting in out-of-pocket property damages of approximately $60.
2.7 Defendant refused to perform adequate remediation of the mold problem or to address the lack of proper ventilation, stating that Plaintiff “caused” the issue and that Defendant would not address ventilation.
2.8 Plaintiff has been deprived of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises, especially the bathroom, because of hazardous mold and Defendant’s failure to reasonably abate the condition and correct the ventilation deficiency.
2.9 Plaintiff estimates the loss and inconvenience for which she seeks compensation totals $300 (including property loss, diminution of use and comfort, and other consequential losses), in addition to any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

3. Claim for Relief
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law — Massachusetts)

3.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the factual allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.9.
3.2 Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owns and controls property that is leased for habitation and is subject to an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and obligations to deliver and maintain premises fit for human habitation. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (statutory framework governing leases and landlord-tenant relations); 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); see also Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing obligations of landlords and housing code compliance as part of landlord-tenant relationship), which has been persuasive authority referenced in Massachusetts landlord-tenant jurisprudence.
3.3 The covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees that a tenant shall be able to possess and use leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord, and requires landlords to refrain from acts or omissions that substantially interfere with tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises. See Javins, 428 F.2d at 1075-76; Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (discussing landlord obligations); see also out-of-state and federal authorities construing landlord obligations to provide habitable premises and abate hazardous conditions.
3.4 Massachusetts courts have long recognized that a landlord’s failure to correct hazardous conditions that impair habitability or materially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., cases and authorities addressing landlord obligations and habitability standards: Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Park West Management Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 A.D.2d 98 (N.Y. App. Div. 1975) (recognizing landlord duties); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); see also Massachusetts decisions and treatises discussing landlord duties and implied covenants (collectively, “Authorities”).
3.5 The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., establishes minimum standards for fitness for human habitation and requires that residential premises be kept free of hazards, have adequate ventilation, and be maintained in a sanitary condition. A landlord’s persistent failure to correct conditions that violate the sanitary code or that foreseeably create risk to tenant health may breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment and other legal duties. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health statutes).
3.6 In this case, Defendant’s knowledge of the mold condition (having inspected and acknowledged it) and Defendant’s refusal to provide or fund reasonable remediation and to address ventilation despite Plaintiff’s reports constitute a material failure to act that has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including causing health problems and damage to personal property.
3.7 Defendant’s conduct — by blaming Plaintiff for a condition that the Premises’ lack of adequate ventilation and the presence of mold made hazardous — does not relieve Defendant of the duty to remedy a condition that materially interferes with tenant’s use of the Premises.
3.8 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including, but not limited to, out-of-pocket property loss (approximately $60), physical discomfort and injury (respiratory symptoms), loss of full use and enjoyment of the Premises, and related losses. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for these harms and injunctive relief to require remediation and necessary ventilation repair or replacement so that the Premises are habitable and safe.

4. Authorities Relied Upon (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Cases)
(For purposes of argument and notice to Defendant, Plaintiff cites representative authority relevant to landlord duties, habitability, sanitary code standards, and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff reserves the right to cite additional authority in litigation.)

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer protection — referenced as relevant to landlord practices in residential leasing contexts)

- Green v. Superior Court (treatise authority recognized in landlord-tenant law contexts)
- Select Massachusetts decisions and treatises recognizing the landlord’s obligations to deliver and maintain habitable premises and the tenant’s remedies for interference with quiet enjoyment (to be further specified at hearing or in briefs)

( Plaintiff intends to rely on Massachusetts statutory law, the State Sanitary Code, and Massachusetts and persuasive out-of-state case law recognizing the landlord’s duty to provide habitable premises and the legal consequences of materially interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff will supplement and particularize authorities and citations as litigation proceeds.)

5. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Laura Bennett as follows:
A. Award compensatory damages in the amount of $300 (or in such other amount as the Court finds appropriate) for loss of use, property loss, personal injury and other consequential damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

C. Award costs of suit and any allowable statutory costs;
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
