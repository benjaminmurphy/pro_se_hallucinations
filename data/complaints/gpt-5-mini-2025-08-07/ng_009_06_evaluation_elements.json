    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges Defendant owns/manages the building and is responsible for maintenance of common areas and hallway smoke detectors (\u00b61.2, \u00b63.2, \u00b65.2), which sufficiently pleads a duty to tenants."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges the hallway detector repeatedly chirped, Plaintiff notified Defendant on multiple occasions, Defendant promised to \"take care of it\" but failed to replace the battery or ensure the alarm worked, and there was no functioning alarm on the night of the fire (\u00b62.1\u20132.3, \u00b63.3, \u00b65.3), which sufficiently pleads a breach."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges that because there was no functioning hallway alarm, residents received no timely audible warning and Plaintiff was exposed to heavy smoke and suffered respiratory injury; it specifically alleges the harm would have been reduced or prevented if the detector had been functioning (\u00b62.3\u20132.6, \u00b63.4, \u00b65.4), which sufficiently pleads but-for causation for pleading purposes."

    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges the injuries (smoke inhalation, respiratory distress, medical treatment, property damage) were a proximate and foreseeable result of failing to maintain the smoke detector and provide warning (\u00b62.4\u20132.7, \u00b63.4, \u00b65.4), which adequately pleads proximate causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges specific actual damages: hospitalization and treatment for smoke inhalation, medical expenses (~$4,200), lost wages (~$1,500), property damage, and general damages for pain and suffering (\u00b62.6\u20132.7, \u00b65.4, WHEREFORE), which adequately pleads damages."
