      "support_reasoning": "The opinion expressly adopts an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, defines it in terms of providing and maintaining premises that are safe, clean, and fit for human habitation, and holds that substantial defects affecting health and safety constitute a breach. It emphasizes that a landlord\u2019s failure to repair essential facilities after notice, causing conditions that impact a tenant\u2019s health and use of the premises, breaches this duty and justifies full rent abatement and other damages. Although the case does not specifically mention mold, its reasoning clearly supports using similar unhealthy housing conditions (like mold from lack of ventilation) as a material interference with use and enjoyment and a breach of habitability/quiet enjoyment duties.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Therefore, we now hold expressly that in the rental of any residential dwelling unit an implied warranty exists in the lease, whether oral or written, that the landlord will deliver over and maintain, throughout the period of the tenancy, premises that are safe, clean and fit for human habitation. \u2026 In determining whether there has been a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, courts should inquire whether the claimed defect has an impact on the safety or health of the tenant. \u2026 When a landlord, after receiving notice of a defect, fails to repair the facility that is essential to the health and safety of his or her tenant, an award of punitive damages is proper."

Although the facts involve a strike rather than mold, the reasoning squarely supports the broader principle that serious, unremedied conditions harmful to health (like pervasive mold from inadequate ventilation) materially interfere with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment and breach the landlord\u2019s habitability obligations. The case thus provides strong doctrinal support for the cited proposition, even if it does not specifically mention mold or the covenant of quiet enjoyment terminology used in the proposition.",

Green squarely recognizes a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, ties it to conditions that affect health and safety, and allows tenants to raise breach of that warranty as a defense in unlawful detainer. Although the opinion does not specifically discuss mold, it clearly establishes the broader habitability and quiet-enjoyment-based framework that the proposition invokes.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe have concluded that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in this state and that the breach of such a warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. Under the implied warranty which we recognize, a residential landlord covenants that premises he leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. This implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that \u2018bare living requirements\u2019 must be maintained.\u201d"
