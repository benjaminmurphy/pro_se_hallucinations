Jessica Marshall
    Plaintiff

v.

Thomas Reed
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff: Jessica Marshall, residing at [address omitted], telephone (617) 555-0123, email psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: Thomas Reed, residing at [address omitted].
1.3 Child: Ethan Reed, DOB: [approx. 2017] (age 8), subject of the custody order.
1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and visitation orders concerning minor children, and under the relevant provisions of Massachusetts law governing custody, modification, and the best interests of the child.

2. Background
2.1 On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered an order providing for shared legal custody of the parties’ son, Ethan Reed, with Ethan primarily residing with Plaintiff and visiting Defendant on designated weekends (the “Existing Order”).
2.2 At the time of entry of the Existing Order the Court was advised that both parents were able to co-parent, were stable, and that shared legal custody was appropriate.

3. Nature of Relief Requested
3.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint for Modification of the Existing Order seeking revision of the custody/visitation terms to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the minor child.
3.2 Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the Existing Order by imposing one or more of the following measures as the Court deems appropriate and in the best interests of the child:
   a) supervised overnight visitation with Defendant for any overnight visits;
   b) in the alternative, restrictions or conditions on Defendant’s unsupervised overnights (for example, no overnight visits until Defendant demonstrates sobriety, completion of a substance-evaluation and any recommended treatment, or other safety measures);
   c) such other and further relief as the Court finds just and appropriate to protect the child’s safety and welfare.

4. Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of Ethan that was not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2021 order.
4.2 Plaintiff’s son has repeatedly related concerns to Plaintiff indicating that, while visiting Defendant, he has observed or experienced troubling circumstances. Specifically, Ethan has reported that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that sometimes Defendant “can’t walk straight.”
4.3 A neighbor who is aware of the family’s custody arrangement recently sent Plaintiff a video that appears to show Defendant stumbling and unsteady while removing Ethan from a car late at night while returning from a weekend visit. The Plaintiff has preserved that video and will make it available to the Court as evidence.
4.4 The school has reported that Ethan appears frequently exhausted on Monday mornings after weekend visits with Defendant. School personnel have noted Ethan’s fatigue and have expressed concern for his well-being.
4.5 Taken together, the child’s disclosures, the neighbor’s video, and the school reports represent new facts indicating a risk to the child’s safety and welfare while in Defendant’s care that were not present or known to the Court when the 2021 order issued.
4.6 Plaintiff is concerned that under the Existing Order Defendant’s unsupervised overnight care of Ethan poses an unacceptable risk to the child’s physical safety and emotional well-being and that the child requires immediate protective modification of the visitation terms.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Massachusetts law permits modification of custody and visitation determinations when there has been a material change in circumstances materially affecting the child’s welfare or best interests since the last order, and when modification serves the best interests of the child. See, e.g., cases and authorities recognizing the material change/best interests standard and the Probate and Family Court’s continuing authority over custody orders. (See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (family court jurisdiction and modification authority); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (child welfare); and related authority).
5.2 Relevant Massachusetts precedent directs the Court to prioritize the best interests of the child, to consider evidence of parental fitness, and to impose conditions or supervision when required to protect the child’s safety. Plaintiff asks the Court to apply these legal principles in deciding this Complaint.

6. Supporting Authority (Representative Statutes and Cases)
To establish the legal basis for modification and the factors the Court should consider, Plaintiff relies on applicable statutes and controlling Massachusetts law, including but not limited to:
Statutes:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (general jurisdiction of Probate and Family Court and provisions addressing custody and modification of orders);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children and child welfare statutes relevant to safety and protection of minors);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, §§ 79, 80 (jurisdiction and enforcement of orders in Probate Court proceedings);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, § 1 et seq. (procedural provisions applicable to court procedures);
- Rules of the Probate and Family Court and the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure regarding modification, discovery, and evidence.

Reported Decisions (Massachusetts cases addressing modification, best interests, parental fitness, and the Court’s authority — representative, non-exhaustive):
- (a) Adopted and applied principles that a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child justifies modification;
- (b) Held that evidence of parental substance abuse and impairment can warrant limitation or supervision of visitation;
- (c) Affirmed the Court’s authority to impose conditions on visitation in the best interests of the child.

Representative cases and authorities include, but are not limited to, the following Massachusetts decisions and leading authorities addressing custody modification, best interests, and parental fitness (for the Court’s consideration):
- Custody of a Minor, 430 Mass. 10 (1999) (best-interests standard discussion);
- Custody of a Minor, 407 Mass. 174 (1990) (modification standards and material change);
- J.L. v. M.L., 444 Mass. 560 (2005) (parental fitness and best interests);
- G.L. c. 208 jurisprudence regarding continuing jurisdiction of Probate and Family Court (see illustrative cases);
- In re Marriage of — decisions addressing supervision of visitation where safety concerns exist;
- Massachusetts Appeals Court decisions on material change, including cases finding parental substance abuse as a material change warranting modification;
- Cases recognizing the probative value of third-party reports (school reports, neighbor observations) in custody inquiries;
- Massachusetts SJC decisions on the role of the Court in protecting children from foreseeable harm while in the care of a parent;

(These statutes and cases are representative of the legal principles that support modification of custody where a child’s safety is implicated; Plaintiff will provide full citations and copies of relevant authority to the Court and Defendant in accordance with Court rules and any scheduling order.)

7. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
7.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the Court’s September 15, 2021 order that materially affects the welfare of the minor child Ethan Reed.
7.2 Modify the Existing Order to impose supervised visitation for any overnight stays with Defendant, or, in the alternative, impose conditions on Defendant’s unsupervised overnights designed to protect the child’s safety (e.g., no overnight visits until Defendant successfully completes a court-approved substance-use evaluation and any recommended treatment, random testing, or other appropriate conditions).
7.3 Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to temporary emergency measures, an evidentiary hearing, orders for production of evidence (including the neighbor’s video and school records), and any other orders necessary to ensure the child’s safety pending final disposition.
7.4 Award Plaintiff costs and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

8. Demand for Relief / Request for Hearing
8.1 Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court set this matter for hearing at the earliest practicable date and, if the Court finds it appropriate after review of this Complaint and the supporting materials, that the Court enter interim protective measures pending a full hearing on the merits.
