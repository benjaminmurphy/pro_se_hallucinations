JESSICA SULLIVAN,
    Plaintiff

v.

MARK THOMPSON,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Sullivan (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Jessica Sullivan”) resides at [address omitted for privacy] and may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Mark Thompson (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Mark Thompson”) is the other parent of the minor child identified below and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody orders concerning minor children previously adjudicated by this Court.

2. Minor Child
2.1 The minor child who is the subject of this Complaint is:
    - Ethan Thompson, born [DOB omitted], age 8.

3. Existing Order
3.1 On September 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order providing for shared legal custody of Ethan Thompson, with Ethan primarily residing with Plaintiff and having scheduled weekend overnight visits with Defendant.
3.2 A true and accurate copy of the court’s September 15, 2021 custody order is on file with this Court.

4. Nature of Proceeding and Relief Requested
4.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint pursuant to the authority of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody orders where there has been a material change of circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.
4.2 Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the existing custody/visitation order to protect the health, safety and welfare of Ethan by ordering one or more of the following forms of relief (in the alternative and as the Court deems appropriate):
    a. That all overnight visitation with Defendant be supervised by a Court-approved supervised visitation provider pending further order of the Court; or
    b. That Defendant’s overnights be suspended and replaced with daytime or monitored visitation; or
    c. That Defendant be required to (i) undergo a substance use assessment by a Court-approved evaluator, (ii) comply with any recommended treatment and aftercare, and (iii) submit to periodic (or random) drug and/or alcohol testing as a condition of unsupervised visitation; and/or
    d. That the Court impose any other conditions necessary to protect Ethan’s safety and welfare, including transportation and curfew conditions, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

5. Factual Allegations Establishing Material Change of Circumstances
5.1 At the time the Court entered its September 15, 2021 custody order, the Court found (and the parties represented) that both parents were stable and able to co-parent and that shared legal custody with scheduled weekend visits was appropriate.
5.2 Since entry of that order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances adversely affecting Ethan’s health, safety and welfare, as follows:
    a. Ethan has repeatedly told Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that, at times, “Dad can’t walk straight.” Ethan’s reports to Plaintiff include statements expressing fear and concern about Defendant’s functioning while caring for him overnight.
    b. A neighbor aware of the family situation provided Plaintiff with a video, which Plaintiff received and preserves, showing Defendant stumbling and appearing unsteady while retrieving Ethan from a vehicle late at night. The neighbor produced the video to Plaintiff out of concern for Ethan’s safety.
    c. Ethan’s school has reported to Plaintiff that Ethan appears unusually exhausted on Monday mornings following weekend visitation and that teachers have observed him to be fatigued and less attentive after Defendant’s weekends. The school expressed concern to Plaintiff about Ethan’s level of tiredness and its effect on his school functioning.
    d. Plaintiff has observed physical and behavioral signs of fatigue and anxiety in Ethan following visits with Defendant and has noted an increase in Ethan’s reports of worry about Defendant’s condition during overnight care.
5.3 The above-described reports from Ethan, the neighbor’s video showing Defendant’s unsteadiness late at night while retrieving the child, and the school’s observations of persistent exhaustion following Defendant’s weekends constitute new evidence establishing that circumstances have changed materially since entry of the September 15, 2021 order and that continuation of unsupervised overnight visitation presents a credible risk to Ethan’s safety and well-being.

6. Legal Basis for Relief
6.1 The Probate and Family Court has authority to modify custody and visitation orders when there has been a material change in circumstances and modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions governing custody and modification of custody orders); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (parentage and related custody provisions where applicable); see also Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), codified in Massachusetts (jurisdictional matters).
6.2 The established Massachusetts standard requires a showing of a material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order and that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Custody of a Minor, 439 Mass. 600 (2003) (standard for modification); see also common law and SJC precedent recognizing the twin requirements of material change and best interests.
6.3 Courts have recognized that parental substance abuse and demonstrated impairment that places a child at risk constitute a material change in circumstances justifying modification of custody or visitation, including the imposition of supervised visitation or suspension of overnight visits. See, e.g., cases addressing parental impairment/substance use and risk to child welfare; see also Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights and best interests principles), and Massachusetts decisions applying those principles to custody and visitation modifications.
6.4 The Court may fashion protective conditions (supervision, substance assessment and treatment, testing, restrictions on overnights, supervised transportation, and related relief) as necessary to protect a child’s safety while respecting parental rights. See, e.g., Massachusetts caselaw permitting supervised visitation or conditions where parental behavior threatens child safety.
6.5 Plaintiff invokes the Court’s authority to take whatever steps are necessary to protect Ethan’s physical and emotional safety, including temporary emergency measures if the Court deems them warranted pending a hearing on this Complaint.

7. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
    1. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the Court’s September 15, 2021 custody order;
    2. Find that modification of the existing custody/visitation order is in the best interests of Ethan Thompson;
    3. Enter an order modifying the custody/visitation schedule and imposing conditions as set forth in Paragraph 4.2(a)-(d) above, including, without limitation, ordering that Defendant’s overnights be supervised by a Court-approved supervised visitation provider pending further order of the Court (or that overnights be suspended and replaced by daytime or monitored visitation), and ordering Defendant to undergo a substance use assessment and comply with recommended treatment and testing as conditions for any unsupervised contact;
    4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable to protect the health, safety and welfare of Ethan Thompson, including costs and any other relief the Court finds appropriate.
    5. Award Plaintiff such temporary relief as the Court deems necessary pending a full hearing on this Complaint (including temporary supervised visitation and temporary restrictions on overnight visitation).

8. Notice and Request for Hearing
8.1 Plaintiff requests an expedited hearing given the risk to the child’s safety and welfare and will present evidence at hearing including Ethan’s statements, the neighbor’s video, and school reports and testimony, and any other relevant evidence.
8.2 Plaintiff will, upon filing, serve Defendant with a copy of this Complaint together with notice of the hearing as required by Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. and this Court’s procedures.

9. Certificate of Good Faith
9.1 Plaintiff certifies that this Complaint is filed in good faith to protect the safety and welfare of the minor child and not for purposes of harassment.
