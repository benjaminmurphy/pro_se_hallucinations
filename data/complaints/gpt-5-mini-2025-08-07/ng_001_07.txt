COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by way of Complaint against defendant Fresh Mart Grocery ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Fresh Mart Grocery is a business entity that owns and operates the retail grocery store located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, where the incident described below occurred. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, managed, and/or maintained the premises at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction because this is a civil action seeking damages for personal injury arising from negligence occurring in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court, Somerville Division, because the events giving rise to this claim occurred at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, which is located in Middlesex County.

5. Plaintiff brings this action within the applicable statute of limitations. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, §2A (three-year limitation period for personal actions arising from tort).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On August 12, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon on a Saturday, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s grocery store, located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA (the "Premises"), shopping in the dairy aisle.

7. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a visible puddle of spilled milk (the "Spill") and slipped and fell, striking her hip against the hard floor and going down hard on her hip.

8. The Spill was more than a small amount; cart tracks were visible running through the liquid, indicating the spill had spread across the aisle and that customers and carts had passed through it.

9. There were no warning signs, cones, barriers, or other prominent warnings in the aisle or nearby to alert customers to the wet/hazardous condition.

10. An employee of Defendant was present in the area, stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet from the location of the Spill. After Plaintiff fell, the employee came to Plaintiff and stated he had noticed the Spill "a few minutes ago" but was finishing what he was doing before he was going to get the mop.

11. Defendant, by and through its employees, servants, agents, and/or representatives, had actual or constructive notice of the Spill and failed to take reasonable steps to remove the hazard or warn customers of the dangerous condition.

12. As a proximate result of Defendant's negligence in failing to maintain safe premises and warn of the dangerous condition, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, including a hip sprain, and required medical treatment and physical therapy.

13. Plaintiff sought care at urgent care the day after the fall and was diagnosed with a hip sprain and was prescribed/required physical therapy. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200. Plaintiff also missed multiple shifts at her place of employment (a café), resulting in wage loss of approximately $800.

14. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and disability attributable to the injuries sustained in the fall, has suffered lost time and enjoyment of life, and expects to incur additional medical and related expenses in the future.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee lawfully on the Premises, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts §§343, 343A (premises liability duty); Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (recognizing duty of care in tort).

17. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and representatives, negligently breached the duties owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:

    a. permitting the Spill to remain on the floor in the dairy aisle for an unreasonable period of time;
    b. failing to inspect the Premises sufficiently and with reasonable frequency to discover the hazardous condition;
    c. failing to take reasonable corrective measures to clean up or contain the Spill;
    d. failing to provide adequate warning to customers (such as placing conspicuous wet-floor signs, cones, or barriers) of a hazardous condition of which Defendant knew or should have known; and
    e. otherwise failing to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances.

18. Defendant knew or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known that spilled liquids on the floor constitute a foreseeable hazard likely to cause customers to slip, fall, and sustain injury.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries, pain, suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages as set forth above.

20. Plaintiff’s damages are approximately $2,000 in economic losses to date (approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and $800 in lost wages), plus non-economic damages for pain and suffering, and future medical and wage losses and related expenses that will be proven at trial.

APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND AUTHORITIES

21. Plaintiff relies on the general common-law negligence and premises-liability principles as established in Massachusetts law and recognized authorities, including but not limited to:

    - Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (establishing basic negligence principles);

    - Mass. R. Civ. P. 8 (general rules of pleading negligence claims);
    - Principles of comparative negligence and apportionment of damages under Massachusetts law (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §85 and related jurisprudence);
    - Applicable Massachusetts premises-liability decisions and authorities interpreting the duty to warn and duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition (see generally cases construing the possessor’s duty to invitees under Massachusetts law).

(For purposes of initial pleading, Plaintiff pleads the foregoing statute and authority and reserves the right to amend and to identify additional controlling Massachusetts decisions and authorities after further legal research and review. Plaintiff will cite and rely upon Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions directly on point at or before trial.)

    c. Physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience in the past and future (amount to be proven at trial);
    d. Any and all other damages recoverable under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:
