COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Parker, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, alleges upon information and belief as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Parker is an individual who, at all times relevant to this Complaint, resided in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual believed to reside in Springfield, Massachusetts, in Hampden County. Venue is proper in Hampden County because the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to Massachusetts law because the claim arises under the common law of negligence and the events giving rise to the claim occurred within this Commonwealth. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about March 15, 2023, Plaintiff parked and was backing into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, a duplex driveway shared between Plaintiff and Defendant.

5. Defendant possessed and maintained at or adjacent to the driveway a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against a wooden fence immediately next to Plaintiff’s regular parking spot.

6. Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant on multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, that she was concerned the ladder might fall onto her vehicle, particularly in windy conditions. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s expressed concerns and stated he would secure or move the ladder, or otherwise tie it down, but he failed to do so.

7. On March 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was backing into the driveway, a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to topple from its leaning position against the fence and crash onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking the hood and the windshield.

8. As a result of the fallen ladder, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained property damage, including a dented hood and a cracked windshield. The vehicle required bodywork and a windshield replacement. Plaintiff paid her insurance deductible and incurred the cost of renting a replacement vehicle while her car was in the shop for over one week.

9. Plaintiff did not suffer physical personal injuries requiring medical treatment, and she did not incur lost wages as a result of the incident. Plaintiff’s documented out-of-pocket property damage, insurance deductible, and rental expenses form the basis for her damages claim.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

10. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 9 as if set forth fully herein.

11. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to exercise reasonable care in the storage, securing, and maintenance of objects on his property and in the shared areas adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area, including but not limited to the ladder described above. Defendant’s duty included taking reasonable precautions to prevent foreseeable harm to others using the shared driveway and parking area.

12. Defendant breached that duty by failing to properly secure the ladder, by failing to relocate it to a safe place, and by failing to take reasonable precautions after being put on notice by Plaintiff that the ladder posed a hazard in windy conditions.

13. Defendant’s conduct was negligent in one or more of the following respects (without limitation):
    a. failing to secure or tie down the ladder so that it would not fall;
    b. leaving the ladder in a foreseeable zone of danger adjacent to Plaintiff’s regular parking spot;
    c. failing to act on repeated warnings from Plaintiff that the ladder was unstable and might fall in windy conditions;
    d. failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the ladder from becoming a hazard to persons and property using the shared driveway.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of duty, the ladder fell onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing property damage to the vehicle (including, without limitation, dented hood and cracked windshield), necessitating bodywork and windshield replacement, and causing Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses including an insurance deductible and temporary vehicle rental expenses.

15. The damages sustained by Plaintiff were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligence. Defendant’s failure to secure the ladder after being notified of the hazard rendered the harm foreseeable and preventable.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for property damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, including the reasonable cost of repairs, insurance deductible amounts, and reasonable rental expenses incurred while the vehicle was being repaired;

B. Award costs and disbursements incurred in prosecuting this action, including taxable costs as allowed by law;

C. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
