Jason Reynolds

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff: Lindsay Carter, resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant: Jason Reynolds, parent of the minor child described below.
1.3. Minor Child: Emily Carter, born 2015 (age 10).
1.4. Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s authority over custody and modification matters under Massachusetts law and the existing custody judgment entered in this Court on April 15, 2022.

2. Relief Requested
2.1. Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody order entered April 15, 2022 (the “Existing Order”), which currently provides for shared legal custody, with Plaintiff as the primary residential parent and Defendant having substantial weekend time, including Sunday nights.
2.2. Specifically, Plaintiff requests the following relief:
   a. An order granting Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding school attendance and day-to-day educational decisions (including unexcused absences, school-directed truancy interventions, and approval of mental-health day absences), OR, in the alternative,
   b. An order reducing Defendant’s overnights that occur on school nights (including Sunday night overnights) so as to minimize absences from school and to ensure consistent school attendance; and
   c. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper, including any reasonable orders for communication, monitoring of school attendance, and referral to a Guardian ad Litem or custody evaluator if the Court finds it appropriate.

3. Factual Allegations — Material Change in Circumstances
3.1. The Existing Order was entered on April 15, 2022. At the time that order was entered, Emily was attending school regularly and performing at or near expected levels academically.
3.2. Over the past year (calendar year 2024–2025), Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily out of school on Mondays following Defendant’s weekend parenting time. Defendant characterizes these absences as “mental health days” and has not supplied any written medical documentation or notes from a licensed mental health professional or physician to justify or support such repeated absences.
3.3. Defendant has also regularly refused to transport or take Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions or otherwise has prevented Emily from attending tutoring that falls during Defendant’s weekend parenting time, thereby interfering with educational remediation recommended by school staff or agreed upon by the parties.
3.4. As a direct result of the pattern of Monday absences following Defendant’s weekends and the missed tutoring sessions, Emily has received truancy warnings from her school and her grades and standardized test scores have declined significantly over the past year.
3.5. Plaintiff has requested that Defendant cooperate on school-related matters in accordance with the Existing Order’s requirement that the parties cooperate on school matters and keep each other informed. Defendant has refused to provide consistent prior notice of absences, refused to provide any documentation for the absences, and has failed to follow through on agreed tutoring arrangements.
3.6. The pattern of absences, missed tutoring, and resulting academic decline constitutes a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order which affects Emily’s welfare and best interests and warrants judicial modification of custody and decision-making authority regarding school attendance.

4. Legal Basis for Relief
4.1. Modification of an existing custody or parenting plan is appropriate where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and best interests since the entry of the prior order. Plaintiff alleges such a material change here in the form of repeated, unexplained school absences occurring immediately after Defendant’s parenting time, refusals to facilitate tutoring, truancy notices from the child’s school, and demonstrable academic decline.
4.2. Plaintiff requests the requested modification in furtherance of Emily’s best interests, consistent with Massachusetts law governing custody and modification. Plaintiff relies on the rules and principles set forth in Massachusetts statutes and caselaw concerning custody modifications, including the authority of this Court to modify legal custody and residential schedule where such modification is necessary to protect the child’s welfare, to ensure compliance with compulsory education laws, and to effectuate regular school attendance.

5. Facts Supporting Requested Specific Relief
5.1. Plaintiff requests final decision-making authority on school attendance because Defendant’s unilateral decisions to keep Emily home on school days, without medical documentation, have directly interfered with Emily’s education and have led to truancy warnings and declining academic performance.
5.2. In the alternative, Plaintiff requests reduction or elimination of Defendant’s school-night overnights (including Sunday nights) that lead to Monday absences, because such overnight parenting time has, in practice, been associated with predictable Monday absences and missed tutoring, undermining Emily’s educational stability.
5.3. Plaintiff is prepared to cooperate with the Court and Defendant to set reasonable notice and documentation protocols for any future school absences (e.g., requiring advance notice and written documentation for medical or mental-health days), to facilitate necessary tutoring and educational supports, and to submit Emily for school-based or independent evaluations if the Court requests them.

6. Request for Temporary Relief (if the Court deems appropriate)
6.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court consider temporary, interim relief pending final hearing if the Court finds an immediate risk to Emily’s educational stability exists. Such relief could include temporary allocation of final decision-making authority for school attendance to Plaintiff, temporary adjustment of Defendant’s school-night overnight schedule, or a requirement that Defendant provide written documentation for any absences and ensure attendance at scheduled tutoring sessions.

7. Reservation of Rights
7.1. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this Complaint with additional facts, declarations, exhibits (including school attendance records, truancy notices, academic records, and any communications reflecting Defendant’s conduct), and to request appointment of a Guardian ad Litem, custody evaluator, or other appropriate expert pursuant to the Court’s discretion.

8. Legal Authorities (Representative)
Note: Plaintiff relies on applicable Massachusetts statutes and caselaw governing custody and modification; the following authorities are cited as representative legal support for the proposition that a material change affecting a child’s welfare justifies modification of custody or decision-making authority and that the child’s best interests and educational stability are paramount considerations.
Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, § 1 (Compulsory attendance and educational statutes).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (Reporting of suspected child abuse and neglect; duty to protect child welfare).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209 (provisions concerning children and custody matters) and related provisions governing custody and guardianship within the Probate and Family Court (as applicable).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and ch. 209A (as applicable to domestic relations and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction to modify prior orders).
- Rules of the Probate and Family Court (Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. and local practice rules) governing modification proceedings, temporary relief, and appointment of guardians ad litem or evaluators.

Representative Caselaw (Massachusetts and relevant federal authority)
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing parental rights and the need to consider parental decisionmaking in custody contexts).
- Authoritative Massachusetts custody/modification decisions addressing the “material change in circumstances” standard and best-interest analysis (representative Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court decisions addressing modification of custody where child welfare or stability is implicated).
- Cases discussing the Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting schedules to protect a child’s educational interests and to ensure compliance with schooling requirements.
- Cases addressing the Court’s discretionary authority to appoint custody evaluators, order supervised visitation or schedule adjustments, and impose conditions on parenting time where necessary to protect the child.
(For the purposes of briefing and hearing, Plaintiff will rely on and provide specific on-point Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions and statutory citations to the Court.)

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order dated April 15, 2022, in that Defendant has repeatedly caused or permitted Emily to miss school on Mondays following Defendant’s weekend parenting time without medical documentation, and has refused to ensure Emily attends scheduled tutoring, resulting in truancy notices and academic decline;
b. Modify the Existing Order to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding school attendance and educational matters (or, in the alternative, reduce Defendant’s school-night overnights, including Sunday night overnights, in a manner the Court deems appropriate to protect Emily’s educational stability);
c. Order Defendant to provide to Plaintiff (and to the school) advance written notice and supporting documentation for any future school absences that are claimed to be for medical or mental health reasons, and to cooperate with the school and tutoring/educational providers to ensure Emily’s attendance at required remedial supports;
d. Grant such temporary or interim relief as the Court deems necessary to protect Emily’s education pending final hearing, including temporary allocation of decision-making authority, schedule changes, or requirements for documentation of absences;
e. Appoint a Guardian ad Litem or custody evaluator if the Court finds such appointment necessary to determine Emily’s best interests; and
f. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
