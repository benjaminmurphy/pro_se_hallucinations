v.                                                          C.A. No. ___________________

Alex Johnson
    Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Mills, and for his Complaint against Defendant Alex Johnson alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Mills (“Plaintiff” or “Mills”) is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Alex Johnson (“Defendant” or “Johnson”) is an individual who resides in Massachusetts and who, upon information and belief, operates motor vehicles on public ways in Massachusetts.

3. The occurrence that gives rise to this action occurred on June 15, 2023, at or near 1234 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02134, which is located in Suffolk County. Venue is proper in the Suffolk County Superior Court.

4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction of this matter under Massachusetts law because the claims arise from torts committed in Massachusetts and damages exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On June 15, 2023, at approximately [time redacted], Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiff was following all applicable traffic laws and was wearing a helmet at the time of the incident.

6. At the same time and place, Defendant had stopped his vehicle and had parked in a loading zone adjacent to the marked bike lane. Upon information and belief, Defendant was occupying the vehicle and preparing to exit.

7. As Plaintiff was proceeding lawfully in the bike lane, Defendant opened his vehicle’s curbside door suddenly and without warning into the bike lane. Defendant did not look up, did not check his mirrors, and did not reasonably ascertain that it was safe to open the door before doing so.

8. Plaintiff, riding lawfully in the bike lane and exercising reasonable care, had no time to stop, swerve, or otherwise avoid the suddenly opened door. Plaintiff struck the edge of the vehicle door, was thrown from his bicycle, and struck the pavement.

9. At the scene Defendant admitted that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone. To protect or limit liability after the incident, Defendant later provided a different account to his insurer that Plaintiff had been “weaving in and out of traffic.” Plaintiff disputes Defendant’s later account and asserts that he was proceeding lawfully and in a straight line within the marked bike lane.

10. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff suffered injuries including road rash to his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and physical damage to his bicycle (a bent frame).

11. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500.00 in medical, dental, and related expenses associated with treatment and repair/replacement (including dental work and the purchase of a new bicycle).

12. Plaintiff also lost approximately $800.00 in wages as a direct result of the injuries sustained in the incident.

13. All of Plaintiff’s damages were caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct as alleged herein.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under the common law and statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to principles governing the operation of motor vehicles and the duty of care owed to nonmotorists and cyclists, a motor vehicle operator and occupant have a duty to take reasonable care to avoid creating hazards for other users of the roadway, including bicyclists. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90 (statutory duties of drivers); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 302A (general duties to avoid unreasonable risk of harm).

16. Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care in opening his vehicle’s door and in exiting his vehicle, including the duty to observe the roadway and adjacent bike lanes, to check mirrors, and to refrain from creating an unreasonable risk of harm to bicyclists proceeding lawfully in the bike lane.

17. Defendant breached that duty by negligently opening his vehicle door into the path of Plaintiff’s bicycle without looking or otherwise reasonably ensuring that it was safe to do so, by using his phone while occupying the vehicle such that he admitted he “didn’t see” Plaintiff, and by failing to take reasonable precautions to avoid collision with an oncoming bicycle.

18. Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages: the unexpected opening of the door directly led to Plaintiff’s collision with the door, his ejection from the bicycle, and the injuries and property damage described above.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical and dental expenses, property damage, lost wages, and other damages in amounts to be proven at trial.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

20. The Plaintiff relies upon general Massachusetts negligence principles and authorities governing duty, breach, causation, and damages, including but not limited to:
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90 (statutory duties of drivers and traffic regulations);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283, 284 (general rules of liability and negligence);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302A (duty to avoid causing emotional harm, where applicable);
   - Massachusetts Civil Jury Instructions (MCJI) — Negligence instructions and instructions regarding duty, breach, proximate cause and damages;
   - SJC and Appeals Court decisions construing negligence principles and duties of motorists toward nonmotorists and bicyclists (e.g., cases addressing duty to observe the road, to refrain from sudden movements into the path of others, and the standard of reasonable care); see, e.g., authorities addressing proximate cause and the reasonableness standard under Massachusetts law.

(For the convenience of the Court and opposing counsel, Plaintiff will rely on and will produce pertinent Massachusetts case law and statutory authority at or before trial to support the theories of negligence set forth herein and to oppose any summary disposition or defense raised by Defendant.)

DAMAGES

21. As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:
   a. Past and future medical and dental expenses (past medical/dental expenses incurred to date are approximately $1,500.00);
   b. Past and future lost wages in an amount to be proven at trial (past lost wages are approximately $800.00);
   c. Past and future loss of use and diminution in value of property (replacement bicycle and repair costs);
   d. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award general and compensatory damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be proven at trial, including medical and dental expenses, lost wages, repair/replacement costs for the bicycle, and non-economic damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress;

B. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, to the extent authorized by law;

C. Award costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees to Plaintiff to the extent permitted by law; and

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATE: December 1, 2025
