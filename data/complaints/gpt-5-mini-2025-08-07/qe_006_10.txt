COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BRIDGEWATER DISTRICT COURT (BROCKTON DIVISION)
Docket No. ___________

JESSICA TAYLOR,
    Plaintiff,

v.

MARK STEVENS,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Jessica Taylor ("Plaintiff") is a resident of Brockton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 or psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Stevens ("Defendant") is the landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (the "Premises"), and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

3. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises commencing on January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

4. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court under Massachusetts venue rules because the Premises are located in Brockton and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Beginning on or about November 3, 2025 (approximately three weeks prior to the date of this Complaint), the hot water supply to the Premises ceased functioning.

6. On the same day the hot water failed, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the lack of hot water and requested repair.

7. Defendant responded that the water heater required a replacement part and that he had ordered the part. Plaintiff continued to follow up.

8. One week later, the hot water remained unavailable. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the part was "backordered." Plaintiff again requested repair and a timetable.

9. A second week passed without restoration of hot water. Defendant represented that he was "working on it" and that the supplier had not shipped the part faster. Defendant continued to respond to texts and communications but did not restore hot water.

10. As of December 1, 2025, the hot water had not been restored, and Plaintiff has gone approximately three weeks without hot water at the Premises.

11. The absence of hot water has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises: Plaintiff has been unable to bathe herself and her infant child in the home, has incurred recurring out-of-pocket expenses to shower at a gym ($approximately $30/month), has expended additional gas/transportation costs to travel to the gym, and has been forced to take her baby to Plaintiff's mother's home for baths so the baby could be bathed in hot water. These out-of-pocket expenses and inconveniences were necessitated by the Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain essential services and facilities.

12. Plaintiff estimates her damages from the loss of hot water and related expenses at approximately $400. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this amount if further damages are discovered or proven at trial.

LEGAL BASIS — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes to a tenant the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. That covenant protects a tenant’s right to possession and the use and enjoyment of the leased premises, free from substantial interference by the landlord or those for whom the landlord is responsible. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 5.1, 12.1 (describing covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations); Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing landlord obligations related to habitability and tenant remedies where premises uninhabitable).

15. Massachusetts statutes and regulations recognize and enforce basic habitability and sanitary standards for residential dwellings. See M.G.L. c. 186 (Mass. Gen. Laws, landlord and tenant statutes generally); M.G.L. c. 111 (public health statutes), including the State Sanitary Code, 105 Code Mass. Regs. 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation). The State Sanitary Code and related public health statutes impose duties on property owners and landlords to provide and maintain heat, hot water and other essential services necessary for human habitation.

16. A landlord's failure to provide or promptly repair essential services such as hot water, when such failure substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, may give rise to a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and recoverable damages for interference, inconvenience, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a proximate result of the breach. See Javins, supra; see also Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 12.1–12.2; Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (illustrative authority on landlord duty to maintain essential services and tenant remedies); see generally 105 CMR 410.000; M.G.L. c. 111, § 127.

17. Under Massachusetts common law and related authority, where a landlord’s conduct or failure to act materially deprives a tenant of the benefit of the leasehold, the tenant may recover damages, including compensation for increased expenses reasonably incurred because of the lack of essential services, and may seek other equitable relief. See Restatement (Second) of Property §§ 12.1–12.2; Javins, 428 F.2d at 1080–81; see also M.G.L. c.186 (general landlord-tenant framework); 105 CMR 410.000.

18. Defendant’s failure, since approximately November 3, 2025, to provide hot water at the Premises, or to promptly effect a permanent repair, and his continued inability to restore that essential service for approximately three weeks despite repeated notice, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and a material interference with Plaintiff’s possession, use, and enjoyment of the Premises. Defendant’s representations that he is "working on it" do not relieve him of the duty to restore essential services with reasonable promptness or to mitigate the prejudice to the tenant.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to out-of-pocket expenses (gym membership/showers, gasoline/transportation costs, alternate bathing arrangements for her infant), inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss of the full benefit of the tenancy.

(For purposes of this Complaint, Plaintiff relies principally upon Massachusetts statutory and regulatory standards (M.G.L. c.111; 105 CMR 410.000), the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as applied in landlord–tenant relations, and established authorities interpreting landlord duties to maintain essential services and the remedies available where such duties are not met.)

20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 19 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial, presently estimated at $400 for out-of-pocket expenses and inconvenience, and seeks recovery of such compensatory damages, together with interest, costs, and any further relief the Court deems just and proper.
