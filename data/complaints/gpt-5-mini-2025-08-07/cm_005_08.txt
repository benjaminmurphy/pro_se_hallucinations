Emily Johnson,
    Petitioner,

v.                                              C.A. No. ___________

Michael Smith,
    Respondent.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

NOW COMES the Petitioner, Emily Johnson, pro se, and respectfully petitions this Court pursuant to Massachusetts law for modification of the parties’ existing custody order entered April 15, 2021, and in support thereof states as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Petitioner: Emily Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555-0123. Email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Respondent: Michael Smith, father of the children, address on file with the Court.

3. Children: Sophie Johnson, born 2015 (age 10); Jacob Johnson, born 2017 (age 8).

4. Jurisdiction and Venue: This Court is the appropriate forum for this action and has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law to modify custody orders. The existing custody order was entered in this Court on April 15, 2021. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

5. Applicability of UCCJEA: Pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (M.G.L. c. 209C), this Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify the existing order entered in this Commonwealth.

STATEMENT OF RELIEF SOUGHT

6. Petitioner seeks a modification of the current custody arrangement to establish primary physical custody of the children with Petitioner (Emily Johnson), with appropriate parenting time to Respondent, and to clarify and restrict unilateral extracurricular scheduling by either parent. Petitioner also requests that the Court order mutual non-disparagement of the other parent in the presence of the children and adopt specific, enforceable procedures governing scheduling, extracurricular enrollment, and exchanges to reduce conflict and protect the children’s welfare.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS — MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. The prior order entered April 15, 2021 provides for joint legal custody. The children primarily reside with Petitioner and visit Respondent on a regular every-other-weekend schedule.

8. Since approximately late 2024 and continuing through the past year (2024–2025), Respondent has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities that occur during Petitioner’s scheduled parenting time (weekends when children are with Petitioner) without notifying Petitioner or obtaining her agreement beforehand.

9. Respondent has told the children that it is Petitioner’s fault if the children miss activities that Respondent scheduled during Petitioner’s time; Respondent has refused to facilitate swaps or otherwise cooperate when Petitioner requests adjustments. Respondent also has used derogatory statements about Petitioner to the children, including calling Petitioner “selfish” and telling the children that Petitioner “doesn’t really love them” when Petitioner asks to swap weekends or discuss schedules.

10. The children have reported this disparagement to Petitioner. As a result of these repeated incidents, at least one child (Sophie) has exhibited physical manifestations of anxiety — recurrent stomach aches on transition days and before contact with the Respondent’s household.

11. Petitioner has attempted informal resolution by requesting communication and coordination regarding activities and by offering reasonable swaps when possible, but Respondent has persisted in unilateral behavior and disparaging remarks.

12. The above-described conduct is new and ongoing and was not contemplated by the Court’s original order. The conduct constitutes a material change in circumstances since entry of the April 15, 2021 order and adversely affects the children’s physical and emotional well-being and their meaningful relationship with both parents.

LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

13. Under Massachusetts law, the standard for modifying an existing custody order requires a showing that (a) there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order, and (b) the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. The requested changes will better protect the children’s health and welfare, promote stability, reduce parental conflict, and clarify decisionmaking authority regarding extracurricular activities and scheduling.

14. This Court has authority to modify custody and to issue orders concerning parenting time, allocation of decision-making authority, and the conduct of the parties with respect to the children. The Court may also issue temporary orders pending final hearing as necessary to protect the children’s welfare.

15. The requested relief is narrowly tailored to address the specific, ongoing problems: (a) repeated unilateral scheduling by Respondent of extracurricular activities during the Petitioner’s parenting time, (b) active disparagement of Petitioner to the children, and (c) demonstrable stress symptoms exhibited by at least one child during transitions.

REQUESTED TEMPORARY RELIEF (PENDING FINAL HEARING)

16. Pending final hearing on this Complaint, Petitioner requests entry of temporary orders as follows:
   a. Maintain primary physical residence with Petitioner pending final determination (or, alternatively, enter an interim schedule that reduces Respondent’s weekend visits if the Court deems temporary primary residence change warranted); and/or
   b. Prohibit Respondent from enrolling the children in any extracurricular activities that would require the children to be absent from Petitioner’s scheduled parenting time without prior written agreement from Petitioner; and
   c. Prohibit either parent from making disparaging remarks about the other parent in the presence of the children or within earshot of the children via electronic means; and
   d. Order both parents to attend court-ordered mediation or parenting coordination as directed by the Court; and
   e. Appoint a Guardian ad Litem or other child-welfare professional if the Court finds that appropriate to evaluate the children’s needs and make recommendations.

PROPOSED PERMANENT ORDERS

17. Petitioner requests that the Court enter the following permanent orders:
   a. Award primary physical custody of Sophie and Jacob to Petitioner, Emily Johnson, with parenting time to Respondent consistent with a schedule to be determined by the Court (or, in the alternative, modify the existing schedule to reduce disruption and to provide stable primary residence with Petitioner);
   b. Continue joint legal custody but specify that decisions regarding extracurricular activities and any activity that would require changing scheduled parenting time require prior written notice to and mutual agreement of both parents; in the event of disagreement, the parent wishing to change time or enroll the child must seek Court approval or mediation before imposing the change;
   c. Order mutual non-disparagement: neither parent shall make negative, demeaning, or disparaging statements about the other parent in the children’s presence or within their hearing, including via voicemail, text, email, or social media; violative conduct may result in remedial sanctions or modification of parenting time;
   d. Require both parents to use a shared parenting calendar (paper or electronic) to post all known extracurricular activities, medical appointments, and school events at least 14 days in advance when reasonably possible; the initiating parent must provide confirmation of registration and any fees and must cooperate in reasonable swaps;
   e. Require that exchanges occur at neutral, agreed-upon locations and include prompt communication of any changes; and
   f. Award such other relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the children’s best interests.

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

18. Petitioner will serve this Complaint on Respondent in accordance with Massachusetts law and will file a Certificate of Service with the Court.

19. WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:
   a. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the April 15, 2021 custody order;
   b. Modify the custody arrangement to make the children’s primary residence with Petitioner and to adopt the proposed orders set forth above (or other orders the Court deems in the best interests of the children);
   c. Issue temporary orders as necessary to protect the children pending final hearing, including those requested in paragraph 16;
   d. Order mediation or parenting coordination and/or appointment of a Guardian ad Litem as the Court finds appropriate;
   e. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

NOTICE TO THE COURT AND PARTIES

20. Petitioner requests that the Court schedule a hearing at the Court’s earliest convenience and provide notice to the Respondent. Petitioner is prepared to submit additional documentary evidence, sworn affidavits, school or medical records, and witness testimony at a hearing.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND NEXT STEPS (HELPFUL, NOT PART OF THE PLEADING)

- Filing recommendations: This Complaint should be filed with the Bristol County Probate and Family Court. Petitioner should also file or be prepared to file any required UCCJEA affidavit, a civil action cover sheet, and a proposed parenting plan or proposed interim order.
- Evidence to support claims: medical documentation of children’s stomach aches, school attendance/participation records, (screenshots of disparaging messages if any), calendar entries showing enrollment in activities during Petitioner’s time, contemporaneous notes summarizing attempts to resolve scheduling issues, and any witnesses (teachers, counselors) who can testify about the children’s emotional distress.
- Mediation/parenting coordination: The Court often refers custody disputes for mediation or parenting coordination; include a specific request for such services if desired.
- Legal research/citations: Petitioner should consult counsel or legal research resources for Massachusetts statutory and case law authority related to modification of custody on the ground of material change in circumstances and best interests of the child. The Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (M.G.L. c. 209C) governs jurisdiction; Massachusetts general domestic relations statutes and case law govern modification and best-interest determinations. If Petitioner wishes, I can produce a separate memorandum of Massachusetts statutory and appellate authorities (with exact citations) to accompany this Complaint after performing targeted legal research.
