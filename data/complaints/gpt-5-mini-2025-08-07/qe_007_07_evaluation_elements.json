    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff rents the Premises, Defendant is the owner/landlord, and the tenancy commenced May 1, 2022 with monthly rent of $2,400 (\u00b6\u00b61\u20133). Those factual allegations are sufficient to establish a landlord\u2011tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant authorized and permitted renovations to the adjacent unit and employed/authorized contractors to perform the work, and further alleges Defendant failed to take reasonable mitigating steps (\u00b6\u00b65\u20138,15,17). Those allegations state acts and omissions by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges prolonged, substantial construction noise (drilling, hammering, worker noise) for roughly two months during weekday business hours, dust and particulate infiltration affecting habitability, and interference with Plaintiff\u2019s ability to work from home and use the unit for ordinary residential purposes (\u00b6\u00b66,7,9\u201310,16). These factual allegations are sufficient at the pleading stage to allege a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint ties the interference directly to Defendant\u2019s authorized renovations and ongoing construction activity and alleges the disturbances (noise, vibration, dust) were caused by that activity (\u00b6\u00b65\u20136,10,15,18). That sufficiently pleads causation between the landlord\u2019s conduct and the interference."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific harms\u2014loss of the benefit of quiet enjoyment, decreased habitability and utility for work and residential use, extra cleaning costs and time, mental distress\u2014and alleges an estimated $2,000 in compensatory damages (\u00b6\u00b611\u201312,18). Those allegations adequately plead damages."
