Michael Thompson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff") resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff's telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant Michael Thompson ("Defendant") resides in Massachusetts (address on file with the Court).
1.3. The subject minor children are Emma Thompson (born 2015) and Noah Thompson (born 2017).
1.4. The Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B.

2. Nature of the Action
2.1. Plaintiff brings this action to modify the existing custody order entered on May 10, 2022 (the "Existing Order"). The Existing Order provides for shared legal custody and contemplates that the children primarily reside with Plaintiff and visit Defendant on a regular schedule.
2.2. Plaintiff seeks (a) a modification of the children’s primary physical custody so that the children primarily reside with Plaintiff; (b) clarified and enforceable rules regarding scheduling decisions and the process for enrolling the children in activities; and (c) related relief as set forth below. Plaintiff asserts that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order and that modification is in the best interests of the children.

3. Relevant Background and Existing Order
3.1. On May 10, 2022, the Probate and Family Court entered the Existing Order establishing shared legal custody and providing that the children primarily reside with Plaintiff with regular parenting time for Defendant.
3.2. The Existing Order further incorporates general parental responsibilities, including supporting the children's relationship with each parent and refraining from disparagement of the other parent in the children's presence.

4. Allegations of Material Change in Circumstances
Since entry of the Existing Order, the following material changes in circumstances have occurred:

4.1. Unilateral Scheduling of Activities and Interference with Parenting Time
4.1.1. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly enrolled or registered the children in extracurricular activities that occur during Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time without prior discussion or agreement with Plaintiff and without reasonable advance notice.
4.1.2. Defendant then represents to the children that Plaintiff is at fault if the children miss those activities while they are with Plaintiff, thereby pressuring the children to view the scheduling as Plaintiff’s responsibility.
4.1.3. These unilateral scheduling decisions have caused persistent conflict about day-to-day parenting time and have interfered with Plaintiff’s parenting time under the Existing Order.

4.2. Disparagement and Alienating Statements
4.2.1. The children have reported that Defendant calls Plaintiff "selfish" and tells them that Plaintiff "doesn't really love them" when Plaintiff requests swapping weekends so that activities may be attended at Defendant's request.
4.2.2. These statements are contrary to the Existing Order’s admonition to support the children’s relationship with the other parent and to refrain from disparagement, and they harm the children's emotional well-being.

4.3. Adverse Emotional and Physical Reactions of the Children
4.3.1. One of the children has developed stomach aches and other somatic complaints on transition days and on days when the scheduling disputes arise.
4.3.2. The emergence of these symptoms correlates with the time period during which Defendant has acted unilaterally and disparagingly regarding Plaintiff.

4.4. Need for Clearer Decision-Making Protocols
4.4.1. The recurring unilateral scheduling and disparagement reflect a breakdown in the cooperative decision-making processes required by shared legal custody under the Existing Order.
4.4.2. Clearer, enforceable procedures for scheduling, notice, and dispute resolution are necessary to protect the children’s stability and best interests.

5. Legal Basis for Modification
5.1. Plaintiff alleges that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order, warranting modification under Massachusetts law. Modification of custody or physical residence requires that the moving party demonstrate (1) a material change in circumstances and (2) that the requested change is in the children's best interests.
5.2. The change in circumstances alleged above—Defendant’s repeated unilateral scheduling that conflicts with Plaintiff’s parenting time, Defendant’s repeated disparaging statements to the children, and the children’s resulting distress and physical symptoms—are material and affect the children’s health, welfare, and the stability of their primary residence.
5.3. Plaintiff further alleges that awarding primary physical custody to Plaintiff and implementing clear decision-making and scheduling rules will promote the children's best interests by reducing conflict, increasing predictability and stability, and protecting the children's emotional and physical welfare.

6. Requested Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter a judgment and order as follows:

6.1. Modify the Existing Order to award primary physical custody of Emma and Noah to Plaintiff (Jessica Thompson), with Defendant to have reasonable and structured parenting time, to be specified by the Court.
6.2. Maintain shared legal custody, unless the Court determines otherwise, but impose clear, enforceable rules regarding scheduling and extracurricular enrollment, including at minimum:
   a. A requirement that either parent provide at least 14 days' written notice to the other parent of any new extracurricular activity that will occur during the other parent’s scheduled parenting time;
   b. Consent requirement or a defined process (including good-faith conferencing and, if necessary, expedited mediation or court intervention) before signing the children up for recurring activities that occur during the other parent's parenting time;
   c. A directive prohibiting either parent from making disparaging or alienating statements about the other parent in the children's presence and an order that the parties refrain from communicating such statements to the children either directly or through third parties;
   d. Interim remedies to address current conflicts, including ordering that the parties consult prior to finalizing registrations and requiring written acknowledgment of agreed swaps of parenting time.
6.3. Issue temporary orders as necessary pending final hearing to preserve the children's stability, including a temporary prohibition on unilateral enrollment in activities that interfere with the other parent's scheduled parenting time and a temporary non-disparagement order.
6.4. Order the parties to participate in mediation or appoint a parenting coordinator to assist with scheduling disputes and communication protocols.
6.5. Order any evaluations or referrals the Court deems appropriate (e.g., mental health evaluation for the children, counseling, parental education).
6.6. Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs and attorney's fees if warranted.

7. Verification
I, Jessica Thompson, the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, declare under the pains and penalties of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the foregoing statements made by me are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
