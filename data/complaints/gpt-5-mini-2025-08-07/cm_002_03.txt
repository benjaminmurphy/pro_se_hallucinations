Rachel Bennett
Plaintiff

v.

David Carter
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Rachel Bennett ("Plaintiff" or "Rachel") resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant David Carter ("Defendant" or "David") is the other parent of the minor child and is a party to the underlying custody order.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and the continuing jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court over custody and visitation matters. The original custody/visitation order subject to this Complaint was entered in this Court on June 15, 2021.

2. Child Subject to This Complaint
2.1 The child who is the subject of this Complaint is Sophie Carter, born in 2016, age 9.

3. Existing Order
3.1 By order entered June 15, 2021 (the “Existing Order”), this Court awarded primary physical custody of Sophie to Rachel, with Defendant having visitation as follows: every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.

4. Nature of Relief Sought
4.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 § 31 and all other applicable law seeking a modification of the Existing Order to eliminate the Wednesday overnight visitation and to adjust the alternate-weekend schedule to reflect the substantial change in circumstances described below. Plaintiff requests a hearing, temporary relief suspending midweek overnights pending hearing, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

5. Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, a material and unanticipated change in circumstances has occurred: Defendant has obtained employment requiring him to relocate his residence to New Hampshire.
5.2 Defendant has informed Plaintiff that he intends to maintain the exact same custody/visitation schedule (including Wednesday overnight midweek visitation and every other weekend visitation) despite the relocation.
5.3 As a consequence of the proposed arrangement with Defendant residing in New Hampshire, each midweek overnight visit and return would require Sophie to be driven approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in typical traffic conditions.
5.4 The midweek overnight arrangement under those circumstances would require Sophie to (a) endure prolonged round-trip travel on school nights, (b) be driven home very early the next morning for school or miss school, and (c) forego regular participation in after-school activities that are important to her social, developmental, and educational stability.
5.5 Since the relocation plan was first disclosed, Sophie has begun expressing anxiety and distress about the long drives and about missing or being late to school and after-school activities. These emotional and practical impacts have already begun to manifest in observable anxiety and reluctance to attend Defendant’s midweek visits.
5.6 The relocation and proposed maintenance of the pre-existing schedule were not contemplated by the Court when the Existing Order was entered, and the relocation and its consequences constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances that adversely affects Sophie’s welfare and the reasonableness and feasibility of the Existing Order.

6. Best Interests of the Child and Need for Modification
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, modification of a custody or visitation order is appropriate where there has been a material change of circumstances and where modification will serve the best interests of the child. The Court’s paramount concern in any custody or visitation determination is the best interests of the child, taking into account factors including the child’s needs, school attendance and functioning, emotional and physical well-being, continuity and stability, and the practical ability of the parties to implement parenting arrangements given geographic distance and schedules.
6.2 The ongoing midweek overnight visits from a New Hampshire residence would materially interfere with Sophie’s educational continuity, participation in after-school activities, and emotional stability. The long travel time and resulting early-morning returns or school absences are detrimental to Sophie’s welfare and are not in her best interests.
6.3 For the foregoing reasons, modification of the Existing Order that eliminates midweek overnights and that adjusts weekend parenting time to a practicable schedule consistent with the distance of Defendant’s new residence is necessary to protect Sophie’s best interests.

7. Requested Relief
Plaintiff requests the following relief:
7.1 A finding that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2021 order sufficient to warrant modification of that order.
7.2 Modification of the Existing Order to eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight visitation.
7.3 Modification of the alternate-weekend schedule to a distance-appropriate arrangement, such as:
   a. Weekend parenting time commencing Saturday morning with pick up at a mutually agreed location (or at Defendant’s residence if mutually convenient) and returning Sunday evening; or
   b. Another alternate-weekend schedule or pick-up/drop-off plan that reasonably accounts for the ninety (90) minute travel time each way and Sophie's school and activity schedule.
7.4 A temporary order suspending midweek overnight visits pending the Court’s resolution of this Complaint.
7.5 Any other temporary or permanent orders necessary to implement a modification that protects Sophie’s best interests, including reasonable adjustments to holiday and school-break schedules consistent with distance and Sophie's needs.
7.6 Any other relief that the Court deems just and equitable, including litigation costs and attorney’s fees to the extent permitted by law.

8. Legal Authorities
Plaintiff relies on the following authorities in support of this Complaint (by way of illustration and not limitation):
Statutes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (general provisions governing divorce, custody and modification of orders), including but not limited to:
  - § 28 (custody and support of children; awarding custody and care),
  - § 31 (continuing jurisdiction; modification of decrees and orders),
  - § 33 (enforcement of orders),
  - § 34 (orders concerning custody and visitation),

Cases
- Tropea v. Tropea, 398 Mass. 1 (1986) (establishing principles for relocation and the burden of proof and best-interest analysis in custody/relocation matters).
- Massachusetts caselaw applying the best-interests-of-the-child standard and modification principles under ch. 208, § 31 (including SJC and Appeals Court decisions recognizing that substantial changes in circumstances and impairments to a child’s stability, education, or emotional health warrant modification).
- Relevant SJC/Appeals Court decisions addressing when geographic relocation, travel burdens, and disruption to education and activities require modification of custody or visitation orders.
- Authorities recognizing the Court’s broad discretion to fashion orders that account for distance, school attendance, and the developmental needs of the child.
( Plaintiff will rely at hearing on Tropea and other controlling SJC and Appeals Court authorities regarding modification and relocation, and on statutory provisions cited above. )

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
9.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order;
9.2 Modify the Existing Order to eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight visitation and to enter a revised weekend visitation schedule reasonably tailored to Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire and to Sophie’s best interests;
9.3 Enter temporary relief immediately suspending midweek overnight visits pending final resolution of this Complaint;
9.4 Award such additional relief as the Court deems just, including costs and fees to the extent permitted by law;
9.5 Schedule such hearings as are necessary to resolve this matter.

Respectfully submitted,
