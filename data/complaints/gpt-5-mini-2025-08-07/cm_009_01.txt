Michael Davis
Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
1.1 Petitioner: Jessica Thompson, resident of Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent: Michael Davis, currently residing on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

2. Children
2.1 The subject child is Sophie Davis, age 8.

3. Jurisdiction and Venue
3.1 This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s general jurisdiction over custody matters.
3.2 Venue is proper in Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the child resides in Barnstable County and the existing custody order was entered by this Court.

4. Existing Order
4.1 A custody order concerning Sophie Davis was entered on May 15, 2019 (the “2019 Order”). Under the 2019 Order, Petitioner has primary physical custody of Sophie. Respondent was awarded parenting time consisting of every other weekend plus one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

5. Statement of Facts and Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 At the time the 2019 Order was entered the parties and child lived in the same town and the midweek overnight parenting time was a short drive to and from school, which made a Wednesday overnight feasible without undue disruption to Sophie’s school routine.
5.2 Since entry of the 2019 Order, Respondent has moved to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from Sophie’s school and primary residence.
5.3 Respondent continues to exercise the midweek Wednesday overnight by picking Sophie up from school, driving approximately ninety miles to Cape Cod, and returning the child to school the following morning. On many occasions Respondent’s return drive requires the child to be awakened at approximately 4:30 a.m. in order to arrive back in time for school.
5.4 As a result of the long drives and early return times, Sophie is chronically fatigued. Sophie’s teacher has reported a noticeable drop in Sophie's participation and attention on Thursdays following the Wednesday overnight visits. Petitioner has observed that Sophie is often exhausted and less engaged in school and extracurricular activities on those days.
5.5 The change in Respondent’s residence and the resulting long-distance midweek parenting time were not anticipated at the time of the 2019 Order and constitute a material change in circumstances adversely affecting the child’s health, well-being, and educational performance.

6. Legal Basis for Modification
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, the Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify custody and parenting time orders when a material change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the child. The court’s modification power is exercised to protect the child’s welfare and to serve the child’s best interests.
6.2 The change in the child’s daily routine, the demonstrable adverse effects on school performance and daytime functioning, and the physical burdens and safety risks of frequent long-distance travel on school nights constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the 2019 Order. The proposed modifications described below are necessary to protect Sophie’s health, rest, and educational interests and therefore are in the child’s best interests.

7. Relief Requested
Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the 2019 Order as follows:
7.1 Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time. The Court should remove from Respondent’s parenting schedule the Wednesday overnight return to school the following morning.
7.2 Modify Respondent’s parenting time schedule to a reasonable alternative that does not require Sophie to make long-distance overnight trips on school nights. Suggested alternatives include, but are not limited to:
   a) Retain every other weekend parenting time with pickup Friday after school or Friday evening and return Sunday evening (or Monday morning prior to school) as arranged to minimize early-morning return on school days; or
   b) Convert the midweek overnight into a midweek day visit (after school through evening) or supervised/extended telephonic/virtual contact on Wednesdays that would not require overnight travel; or
   c) Any other schedule the Court finds appropriate in Sophie’s best interests that eliminates marathon school-night drives.
7.3 Grant any further relief that the Court deems just and proper to protect the health, safety, education, and welfare of Sophie, including but not limited to an order directing a Court-ordered custody/parenting-time evaluation or appointment of a guardian ad litem or a social worker to assess the child’s needs and the suitability of the parties’ proposed schedule.
7.4 Provide for such further orders as necessary to effectuate the modification (exchange locations, transportation arrangements, times, and procedures) and to maintain Sophie’s consistent school attendance and adequate rest.

8. Exhibits and Supporting Evidence
8.1 Petitioner will rely upon the 2019 custody order (copy to be filed as an exhibit), testimony of Petitioner, documentary evidence and the testimony of Sophie’s teacher and/or school records reflecting Sophie's decreased participation and fatigue on Thursdays, and any testimony or evidence the Court deems appropriate to establish the material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child.
8.2 Petitioner requests that the Court consider a limited evidentiary hearing, appointment of a guardian ad litem or special master, or referral to court-connected mediation or parenting coordinator as needed.

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
9.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2019 Order such that modification is warranted;
9.2 Modify the 2019 Order to eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight and adjust Respondent’s parenting time so that the child is not required to make long-distance overnight trips on school nights, as set forth above or in a manner that best serves the child’s best interests;
9.3 Order any additional relief the Court deems appropriate to protect Sophie’s health, safety, and educational needs, including appointment of an evaluator or guardian ad litem and entry of specific transportation and exchange orders; and
9.4 Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

10. Authority (Legal Standard)
10.1 Petitioner brings this Complaint under the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child. Petitioner relies on the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C) for jurisdictional principles where applicable, and on Massachusetts legal principles recognizing the court’s continuing power to modify custody to serve the best interests of the child when changed circumstances so require.
10.2 Petitioner will rely upon controlling Massachusetts precedent and statutory authority addressing (a) the material change in circumstances standard for custody modification, (b) the best interests of the child analysis, and (c) the Court’s authority to order modifications, evaluations, and appropriate ancillary relief.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner requests that the Court enter the relief set forth above.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

Notes and Practical Matters
- Petitioner should (and typically must) attach a copy of the 2019 Order as an exhibit.
- Petitioner should be prepared to file and serve a summons, schedule a hearing, and comply with local Probate and Family Court rules regarding required forms and certificates (such as financial statements, certificate of service, and proposed parenting plan).
- If requested, the Court may order a custody evaluation, appointment of a guardian ad litem, or a hearing to receive testimony and evidence regarding the child’s fatigue and educational impacts.
- Because representation and pleadings requirements vary and specific statutory citations and case law are frequently cited in court filings, Petitioner may wish to consult counsel or a local self-help clinic for review of this draft before filing.

Important limitation and offer to assist further
I can (if you wish) prepare a finalized, court-ready complaint and a proposed parenting schedule and a list of the typical exhibits and sample language for a proposed order. I did not include exhaustive reporter citations in this draft. If you would like, I can prepare a supplemental authority list (statutes and reported Massachusetts cases) for inclusion with the filing; please note I cannot provide legal advice and, where possible, you should confirm statutory and case citations with local court resources or counsel.
