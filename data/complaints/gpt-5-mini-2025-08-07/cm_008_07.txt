Michael Reed
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Laura Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Michael Reed ("Defendant") is the other parent of the minor child identified below and resides in Massachusetts.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the statutes and authority governing custody and modification of custody orders in Massachusetts and the Probate and Family Court’s continuing jurisdiction over its prior decrees.

2. Minor Child
2.1 The subject child of this action is Emily Reed (born 2015), age 10 (hereafter, “Emily” or “the child”).

3. Prior Order
3.1 A judgment concerning custody of Emily was entered in this Court on March 15, 2021 (the “Prior Order”).
3.2 The Prior Order provides, among other things, that the parties share legal custody, that Plaintiff is the primary residential parent, and that Defendant has substantial weekend parenting time including Sunday overnights. The Prior Order requires the parties to cooperate on school matters and to keep each other informed of educational issues.

4. Change in Circumstances — Material Facts
4.1 At the time the Prior Order was entered, Emily was attending school regularly and performing satisfactorily in school, including grades and standardized testing appropriate for her age and grade level.
4.2 Over the past year (i.e., calendar year 2024–2025), Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays immediately following his weekend parenting time, asserting that Emily “needs a mental health day.”
4.3 There have been multiple unexcused absences on these Mondays. Defendant has failed to provide any medical, psychiatric, or school documentation to substantiate the asserted medical or mental health need for these repeated absences.
4.4 Plaintiff has notified the school administration, and the school has issued truancy warnings because the pattern of absences has now materially affected Emily’s attendance record.
4.5 Emily’s school performance has declined over the past year: her grades have dropped and recent test scores are materially lower than before the pattern of Monday absences began.
4.6 Defendant also regularly refuses to bring Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions or other school-related academic interventions when they fall during his parenting time, without communicating alternative arrangements or permitting Plaintiff to ensure Emily receives the tutoring.
4.7 Defendant’s unilateral and repeated decisions to keep Emily home from school on school days and his refusals to cooperate with required academic interventions directly conflict with the Prior Order’s requirement that parents cooperate on school matters and have had a demonstrable adverse impact on Emily’s education, attendance, and welfare.
4.8 Plaintiff has attempted to resolve these issues by communicating with Defendant and the school but has been unable to secure Defendant’s cooperation or a cessation of the pattern of absences.
4.9 The foregoing facts constitute a material change in circumstances since the entry of the Prior Order that adversely affects Emily’s best interests and warrant modification of the Prior Order to protect Emily’s educational welfare.

5. Legal Basis for Modification
5.1 The Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify custody and parental decision-making orders when a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare has occurred such that modification is in the best interests of the child. Plaintiff invokes the Court’s authority to modify the Prior Order accordingly.
5.2 Plaintiff seeks relief under applicable Massachusetts law governing child custody and the modification of custody orders, including (without limitation) the UCCJEA and the provisions authorizing the Probate and Family Court to modify custody orders in the best interests of the child.

6. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter an order as follows:

A. A finding that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Prior Order (entered March 15, 2021), specifically including Defendant’s repeated, unverified pattern of keeping Emily home from school on Mondays after his parenting time and refusing to cooperate with scheduled tutoring, and that such change adversely affects Emily’s best interests.

B. Modification of the Prior Order to provide Plaintiff with final decision-making authority over educational matters, including school attendance, academic placements, tutoring, and extracurricular programs, so that Plaintiff may ensure Emily’s consistent school attendance and academic interventions necessary for her welfare.

C. Alternatively or in addition, modification of the parenting time schedule to reduce or eliminate Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time that precedes school days (or to restructure weekend parenting time so that Defendant’s parenting time does not include an overnight that results in missed school on Monday mornings), or impose a restriction that the child must be returned to Plaintiff’s care at a time that guarantees full attendance at school the following day.

D. An order directing both parties to cooperate with the school and to provide timely written documentation to the other parent and the Court of any health or mental health-related school absence, including any medical or mental health professional notes; and that in the absence of such documentation an absence shall be treated as unexcused and not permitted as a basis for missing school.

E. An order requiring Defendant to ensure Emily attends all scheduled tutoring and school remediation sessions while in his care or to provide notice and reasonable alternative arrangements that ensure Emily receives the scheduled tutoring (including providing transportation or permitting makeup sessions).

F. An order requiring the parties to exchange, on a regular basis, copies of school reports, progress reports, communications from teachers, standardized test results, truancy notices, and any communications from health or mental health providers regarding Emily.

G. Temporary and/or emergency relief as the Court deems appropriate and necessary to prevent further deterioration of Emily’s school attendance and academic progress pending final hearing on the merits.

H. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper to protect Emily’s best interests, including an award of costs and reasonable counsel fees as permitted by law (or, alternatively, reserving the issue of fees pending further proceedings).

7. Request for Hearing
7.1 Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint for Modification. Given the ongoing adverse effect on Emily’s education and well-being, Plaintiff requests that the Court consider temporary emergency relief addressing school attendance and Sunday-night overnight parenting time pending final determination.

8. Verification and Prayer for Relief
8.1 Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the facts set forth in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of her knowledge, information and belief.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the relief requested in Paragraph 6, and any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.
