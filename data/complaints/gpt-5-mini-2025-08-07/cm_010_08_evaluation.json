It invalidates the Washington visitation order precisely because the trial court failed to accord deference to the fit mother\u2019s judgment and instead substituted its own \u201cbest interests\u201d view. Thus Troxel is direct authority for parental rights and required deference to fit parents\u2019 decisions regarding their children.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. \u2026 [S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i. e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family\u2026 And, if a fit parent's decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent's own determination.\u201d"

The Court extensively analyzes due process principles in the parental rights context using the Mathews v. Eldridge framework, confirming that termination proceedings must afford parents fundamentally fair procedures. This squarely supports the general proposition that Santosky is a leading case on due process principles applicable to parental rights.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment demands more than this. Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence. \u2026 When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely holds that an unwed father who has sired and raised his children has a constitutionally protected parental interest and cannot be deprived of custody without an individualized hearing on fitness. It grounds this in both due process (recognizing the fundamental interest in the care, custody, and management of one\u2019s children) and equal protection (requiring the same procedural protections afforded other parents). Thus, it is a leading parental-rights precedent and supports the generic proposition for which it is cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe conclude that, as a matter of due process of law, Stanley was entitled to a hearing on his fitness as a parent before his children were taken from him and that, by denying him a hearing and extending it to all other parents whose custody of their children is challenged, the State denied Stanley the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \u2026 The private interest here, that of a man in the children he has sired and raised, undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u201d"
