COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint against Defendant David Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her current address is 123 Elm Street, Apartment __, Cambridge, MA 02139. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant David Thompson is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139 (the “Premises”), and at all times relevant hereto acted as landlord with respect to the Premises.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises beginning on June 1, 2021. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $2,200.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Cambridge District Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, §§ 19 and 27 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and district court jurisdiction over landlord-tenant matters), because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, and the amount claimed is within the jurisdictional limits of this court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. For the past approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Defendant has caused or permitted ongoing renovation and construction work in the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment (the “Renovation”).

6. The Renovation has involved frequent daytime drilling, hammering, loud conversation among workers, and other construction activities, typically occurring roughly between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.

7. Plaintiff works from home and regularly participates in telephone and video calls and other work requiring concentration. The constant construction noise during typical business hours has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises for the intended purpose of quiet living and working, and has impaired Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

8. The Renovation has also generated dust which has migrated into Plaintiff’s unit through vents and other means, causing an additional disruption and diminution of the habitability and enjoyment of the Premises.

9. Defendant notified Plaintiff in advance that the Renovation would take place and the workers have maintained generally reasonable daytime hours; however, the Renovation has continued for approximately two months and Defendant has indicated it may continue for another one to two months.

10. Defendant offered Plaintiff a modest rent reduction of $100 for one month as compensation for the disruption. Plaintiff rejected that offer as inadequate compensation for the ongoing and substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of her apartment.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the Renovation and Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered a loss of the benefit of quiet enjoyment, decreased use of her unit, and mental and emotional distress, and she seeks damages for the diminution in value of her tenancy and for the interference with her rights as a tenant.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 above.

13. Under Massachusetts law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is a term of every lease, express or implied, and requires that tenants not be materially and substantially deprived of their possession, use, or enjoyment of leased premises by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Restatement (Second) of Property § 16.4 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment); and Massachusetts case law recognizing and enforcing the covenant of quiet enjoyment in the landlord-tenant context.

14. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s acts or uses of adjacent premises, or permitting others to use adjacent premises, results in substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased property. Substantial interference may include persistent and pervasive noise, dust, or other intrusions that materially impair the tenant’s reasonable expectations under the tenancy. See, e.g., cases applying the covenant in Massachusetts and construing its scope.

15. Defendant’s conduct in permitting and continuing the Renovation, with repeated daytime drilling, hammering, loud worker conversation, and dust intrusion into Plaintiff’s unit for an extended period, has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and therefore constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. Defendant’s offer of a single $100 rent reduction for one month is inadequate compensation for the continuing and ongoing interference and does not cure the breach.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including the diminution of the rental value of the Premises and loss of the benefit of the bargain under the tenancy. Plaintiff estimates her damages to be approximately $1,000 based on the period of disturbance and the diminution in rental value, and she also reserves the right to seek additional damages should the Renovation and interference continue.

18. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:

B. An order finding that Defendant has breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment with respect to the Premises;

C. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. Costs of suit and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Plaintiff expressly does not at this time seek eviction relief against herself and reserves all rights to pursue additional remedies if the interference continues.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Notes and Practical Guidance (for Plaintiff’s information only)
- Plaintiff should be prepared to provide the Court with evidence of the noise and dust (logs of dates and times of disturbances, recordings if any, photographs of dust, any communications with Defendant about the Renovation, and proof of the rent and tenancy).
- If Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees in the future, Massachusetts law generally requires a contractual or statutory basis for fee-shifting; absent such basis, attorney’s fees are not routinely awarded.
- Plaintiff may also consider seeking a rent abatement for future months during which the substantial interference continues; she should preserve contemporaneous evidence and consider filing a motion for immediate relief if the interference escalates.
