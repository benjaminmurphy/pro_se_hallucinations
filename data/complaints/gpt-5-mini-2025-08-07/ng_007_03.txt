PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Lucas Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident of Brockton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s address for service is 45 East Main Street, Brockton, MA (the location of the incident), and Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center ("Defendant") operates an after-school program and community recreation facilities located at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts. At all relevant times Defendant conducted business at that location and invited children, including Plaintiff’s child, to participate in supervised activities in its gymnasium.

3. The incident described below occurred on September 15, 2023 at the Brockton Community Center gymnasium located at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

4. This action is brought in the Brockton District Court under the court’s general civil jurisdiction. The amount in controversy (medical expenses of approximately $5,200 and lost wages of approximately $1,500, plus pain and suffering and other damages) is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the acts and omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant operated an after-school program at the Brockton Community Center, which advertised and represented that children participating in its gym activities would be supervised at all times by staff.

8. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old child attended Defendant’s after-school program at the Brockton Community Center gym. Approximately twenty children were in the gym that day.

9. Defendant’s staffing plan for gym supervision that day called for two staff members to be present and supervising the children. At or about the time of the incident, one staff member left the gym area to complete paperwork in the office, leaving one staff member physically present in the gym.

10. The single staff member who remained in the gym was largely inattentive to the children; she was positioned near the bleachers and was primarily looking at her phone rather than actively supervising the children.

11. Two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing a rough "tackle" style game on the hardwood gym floor. Several younger children, including Plaintiff’s child, expressed concern and informed the staff member that the older boys were playing too rough.

12. The staff member failed to intervene or otherwise control the older boys’ dangerous conduct and responded dismissively, saying "boys will be boys."

13. As a direct result of the lack of supervision and Defendant’s failure to intervene, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s child with substantial force. Plaintiff’s child hit his head on the hardwood floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.

14. Plaintiff’s child was transported to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion and related head injury. He required medical evaluation and treatment, missed several days of school, and has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, emotional distress, and related impacts.

15. As a result of the incident and the injuries sustained, Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,200 in medical expenses and has suffered lost wages of approximately $1,500 (for time taken to attend to his child and manage medical care). Plaintiff also claims damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, and other compensatory damages in amounts to be proven at trial.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

17. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of children attending and participating in Defendant’s after-school program and gym activities. That duty included the duty to provide adequate staff supervision, to enforce reasonable rules for safe play, and to take prompt action to prevent foreseeable harms to children in the gym.

18. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
   a. Failing to provide the advertised and required number of staff present to supervise the gym (leaving only one staff member with approximately twenty children);
   b. Failing to reasonably supervise the children in the gym, permitting older children to engage in a rough tackle game on a slippery/hard surface;
   c. Failing to respond reasonably to other children’s reports that the older boys were playing dangerously;
   d. Failing to intervene when the risk of serious injury was obvious and foreseeable; and
   e. Otherwise failing to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent operator of an after-school program and community center would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.

19. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s child’s injuries. The serious head injury, concussion, and period of unconsciousness that Plaintiff’s child suffered were foreseeable consequences of leaving children unsupervised on a hard-surfaced gym floor while older children engaged in rough physical play.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained damages including, but not limited to, medical expenses (approximately $5,200), lost wages (approximately $1,500), past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES

21. The elements of a negligence claim under Massachusetts law are (1) the existence of a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) causation (both actual and proximate); and (4) damages. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §282; see also recognized tort principles as applied by Massachusetts courts. Courts routinely recognize a duty to protect invitees and participants from foreseeable risks that may be prevented by reasonable supervision and care.

22. In cases involving supervision of children and the operation of recreational programs, courts have held that operators and supervisors may be held liable where inadequate supervision or reckless indifference to known dangerous conduct causes injury. Reasonable foreseeability of harm from unsupervised dangerous activity is a core element of liability.

23. Plaintiff intends to rely on applicable Massachusetts statutes governing civil actions and statutes of limitations (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231; ch. 260) and on controlling tort law and authorities, including common law negligence principles and the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Plaintiff also intends to cite Massachusetts authorities applying those principles to facts substantially similar to those alleged herein.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to:
   1. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,200;
   2. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,500;
   3. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial;

B. For interest, costs, and disbursements allowable by law;

C. For such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

SIGNED UNDER THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF PERJURY THIS 1st DAY OF DECEMBER, 2025.

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Lucas Thompson
