COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Morales, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Tracy Hargrove, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Morales is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Tracy Hargrove is the owner of the three-unit apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was responsible for maintenance of the sidewalk abutting that property.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts law governing personal injury actions. Venue is proper in Worcester Superior Court because the acts and omissions complained of occurred at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA.

4. This action is commenced within the statutory period. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on February 15, 2023; today’s date is December 1, 2025, and the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions is complied with. See M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On February 15, 2023, at approximately [during daytime delivery], Plaintiff was lawfully on the sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA delivering groceries to a tenant of the building.

6. Defendant owned and controlled the three-unit apartment building and was responsible for maintaining the sidewalk adjacent to the building, including clearing snow and ice in a reasonably safe condition for invitees and the public.

7. Following a snowstorm in February 2023, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but did not apply salt, sand, or other de-icing material to the cleared path or the surrounding surface.

8. Over the next several days, the narrow shoveled path deteriorated into a sheet of ice due to daytime melting and nighttime refreezing.

9. Tenants of the apartment building observed the icy condition and sent text messages and photographs to Defendant notifying her of the dangerous icy patch. In response, Defendant told the tenants that “the sun will take care of it” and took no measures to render the sidewalk safe.

10. While walking on the sidewalk in the usual manner to deliver groceries to a tenant, Plaintiff stepped onto the icy patch, her feet slipped out from under her, and she fell backward, landing heavily on her lower back.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the fall caused by the icy condition and Defendant’s failure to take reasonable remedial measures, Plaintiff suffered a lower back injury requiring medical treatment.

12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,000 in wages as a result of the injury. Plaintiff has also suffered pain, suffering, physical impairment, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other general damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

13. Defendant’s failure to inspect, remove, or reasonably mitigate the dangerous icy condition, despite notice by tenants and a duty to maintain the sidewalk, was negligent and a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(NEGLIGENCE)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff and to others lawfully on the sidewalk to exercise reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangerous conditions that she knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known.

16. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. failing to use ordinary care to inspect, remove, or treat hazardous ice on the sidewalk;
    b. failing to apply salt, sand, or other de-icing material after shoveling a narrow path;
    c. failing to take reasonable action after being notified by tenants (including by text and photographs) of the dangerous icy condition; and
    d. otherwise failing to use ordinary care under the circumstances.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining bodily injuries and damages as alleged above.

18. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused solely by reason of Defendant’s negligence and were not the result of any negligence on the part of Plaintiff.

LEGAL AUTHORITY

19. The elements of a negligence claim under Massachusetts law are duty, breach, causation and damages. See, e.g., Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (House of Lords) (establishing modern duty principle); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 285, 343 (1965) (duty of possessor of land to keep premises safe); and Massachusetts decisions applying these principles.

20. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that possessors or owners of land who invite the public or have invitees on their premises owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of latent or nonobvious hazards. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; and Massachusetts caselaw recognizing and applying these principles in premises-liability contexts.

21. Massachusetts decisions have further recognized that, when a landowner has notice (actual or constructive) of a dangerous condition such as accumulations of ice and snow or created a dangerous condition by partial removal, the landowner may be liable for injuries resulting from the hazard if reasonable remedial measures are not taken. See, e.g., cases applying common-law premises liability and duty principles (collectively cited authority supporting the elements and standards of care in Massachusetts premises-liability and negligence law).

22. Plaintiff relies on and will offer at trial pertinent Massachusetts authorities that define the scope of an owner’s duty, the applicable standard of care, and the allocation of fault in slip-and-fall cases; including, but not limited to, the Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A, 302A and pertinent Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions interpreting these principles and statutes governing limitations and liability. See, e.g., M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations), Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A, and Massachusetts cases applying these authorities in premises-liability contexts.

(For purposes of the Complaint, Plaintiff cites illustrative authority on negligence and premises liability as applied in Massachusetts: Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 343, 343A; M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A; and Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court precedent applying these authorities in premises-liability cases. Plaintiff will cite specific Massachusetts case law authorities in full in subsequent filings and at trial, including controlling SJC and Appeals Court decisions addressing owners’ duties with respect to sidewalks, snow and ice removal, notice, and foreseeability.)

DAMAGES

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained medical expenses in the approximate sum of $1,500 and lost wages in the approximate sum of $1,000.

24. Plaintiff has also suffered and will continue to suffer pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other compensable damages, in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact but in no event less than that permitted by law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Tracy Hargrove as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including:
   1. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,500;
   2. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000;
   3. General damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and related non-economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial;

B. For pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. For costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATE: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Jessica Morales

Author’s note: This Complaint asserts a single cause of action—negligence—on the facts you provided. It includes statutory reference to the Massachusetts statute of limitations (M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A) and foundational authorities on duty and premises liability (Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 343, 343A and Donoghue v. Stevenson). Plaintiff will amplify and cite controlling Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions and specific statutory authority in greater detail in subsequent pleadings and at trial, as required by local practice. If you wish, I can produce a version that appends a fuller, more explicit list of Massachusetts cases and exact citations addressing sidewalks and snow-and-ice premises liability (suitable for filing), but that draft will be based on additional research and citation formatting.
