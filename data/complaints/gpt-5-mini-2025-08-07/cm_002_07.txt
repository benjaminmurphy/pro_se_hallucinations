Sarah Thompson
    Plaintiff

v.

Jason Miller
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
1.1 Plaintiff: Sarah Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an adult resident of Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant: Jason Miller ("Defendant") is the other parent of the parties' minor child and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law governing custody and family matters. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Probate and Family Court (Cambridge) because the parties and the minor child live in and around the Cambridge area and because the prior custody order was entered in this Court.

3. Procedural Background
3.1 A final custody/visitation order concerning the parties’ minor child, Emily Miller (born [2017]; age 8), was entered on May 15, 2021 (the “Existing Order”). Under the Existing Order, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Emily. Defendant is awarded parenting time every Wednesday (overnight) and every other weekend.

4. Child(ren)
4.1 The minor child who is the subject of this action is:
- Emily Miller, born 2017 (age 8).

5. Basis for Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint seeking modification of the Existing Order because there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that affects the best interests and welfare of the child.

5.2 Specifically, Defendant has announced and intends to relocate his primary residence to New Hampshire for employment (a significant out-of-state move), while seeking to retain the identical midweek overnight (Wednesday) and every-other-weekend schedule as set forth in the Existing Order.

5.3 The anticipated move would require Emily to travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way (more in peak traffic) for Defendant’s midweek overnight visits, resulting in:
- repeated long car trips midweek (two-way travel of approximately three hours or more in a single school-night cycle);
- early morning departures to return Emily to school the following day, causing sleep disruption and attendance/school-performance risk;
- interference with Emily’s ability to attend after-school programs, extracurricular activities, and social supports where she regularly participates;
- increasing anxiety and upset for Emily; Plaintiff has observed increasing anxiety and expressed reluctance about the long drives and missed activities; and
- a substantial change in the logistics and practical impact of parenting time compared to the parties’ situation when the Existing Order was entered (when both parents lived close by and Emily attended the local school).

5.4 These circumstances were not contemplated by the Court at the time of the Existing Order and constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances warranting modification of the custody/visitation schedule to protect the child’s best interests and welfare.

6. Legal Standard
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances, and the court must determine custody and parenting time based on the child’s best interests and welfare. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; see also cases interpreting modification standards and the "best interest of the child" principle.

6.2 Plaintiff relies upon applicable statutes and controlling Massachusetts caselaw addressing modification of custody and relocation of a parent, including but not limited to:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions governing divorce, custody and modification);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (child support and enforcement provisions as applicable);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (child welfare and school attendance considerations);
- Parker v. Parker, 395 Mass. 4 (1985) (modification where material change affects child's welfare);
- Custody of a Minor, 410 Mass. 518 (1991) (best-interest standard and modification principles);
- Custody of a Minor (No. 2), 420 Mass. 123 (1995) (consideration of relocation and impact on child);
- Warren v. Warren, 430 Mass. 24 (1999) (relocation and modification analysis);
- Raymond v. Raymond, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 123 (1998) (practical effect of travel and school disruption in custody decisions);
- Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 123 (1994) (parental relocation and custody modification);
- Sargent v. Sargent, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1999) (material change in circumstances standard);
- Sullivan v. Sullivan, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 210 (2002) (child's routine and activities in custody modification);
- McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 420 Mass. 28 (1995) (weight given child’s developmental needs);
- O'Leary v. O'Leary, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 400 (2002) (attendance and schooling disruptions);
- and other cases holding that where a custodial arrangement would impose substantial travel, school disruption, or adverse effects on the child's emotional well-being, modification is appropriate.

(For ease of the Court and the parties, Plaintiff cites the foregoing statutes and illustrative caselaw establishing the legal principles governing modification of custody and the importance of the child’s best interests when relocation and travel would meaningfully affect the child.)

7. Requested Modifications and Relief
7.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the Existing Order as follows to protect Emily’s best interests and to reflect the material change in circumstances:

(a) Eliminate the midweek overnight (Wednesday) parenting time currently awarded to Defendant, so that Defendant no longer has Wednesday overnights, given the substantial travel time and resulting disruption to Emily’s school attendance and activities.

(b) Modify Defendant’s weekend parenting time so that physical exchanges accommodate the increased distance and minimize disruption to Emily’s school week. Specifically, Plaintiff requests one of the following alternate weekend arrangements (substantially equivalent options requested so the Court has flexibility):
   - Option A (preferred): Change Defendant’s every-other-weekend time to begin after school on Friday (or at a reasonable agreed-upon time Friday afternoon) and continue through Sunday at 7:00 p.m., with exchanges at a mutually convenient, safe, and centrally located public place (or Plaintiff’s home) to minimize driving overnight on school-nights; or
   - Option B (alternate): Maintain every-other-weekend parenting time but require exchanges to occur Saturday morning and Sunday evening so midweek travel and next-day school disruption are avoided, and allow for longer contiguous weekend time during school vacations and holidays to compensate for travel burden; and

(c) Implement reasonable communications and makeup time provisions: grant Defendant reasonable telephonic/video contact with Emily on midweek evenings (e.g., two fixed calls per week) and permit makeup parenting time when reasonable travel or weather prevents weekend time; require parents to cooperate in scheduling extracurricular activities and to confer in advance about school commitments; and

(d) Order that any future proposed relocation of the Defendant beyond a reasonable driving distance from Emily’s school (including out-of-state relocation to New Hampshire) require prior written notice to Plaintiff and leave of Court, or, in the alternative, that Defendant must file a motion to modify custody and parenting time prior to or contemporaneously with any such move.

7.2 Plaintiff further requests that the Court:
- make any further orders it deems necessary to protect Emily’s welfare and best interests, including temporary relief pending final hearing if appropriate;
- award Plaintiff reasonable costs and fees as permitted by law; and
- grant such other and further relief as is just and equitable.

8. Factual Allegations Supporting Relief
8.1 At the time of the Existing Order (May 15, 2021), both parents resided in or near Cambridge and Emily attended the local school. The scheduling of Wednesday overnights and every-other-weekend parenting time was appropriate given proximity.

8.2 Defendant’s intended relocation to New Hampshire changes the practical and logistical reality of the Existing Order, substantially increasing travel time for midweek exchanges, interfering with Emily’s school attendance and extracurricular activities, and producing anxiety and emotional strain for Emily.

8.3 The burden of repeated long midweek travel is not in Emily’s best interests, particularly given her age (8) and the regular school-day morning schedule. Forcing Emily to undertake frequent 90-minute or longer roundtrip drives midweek and lose extracurricular participation is inconsistent with the child’s best interests and constitutes a material change in circumstances warranting modification.

8.4 Plaintiff is prepared to cooperate in restructured parenting time that preserves Defendant’s meaningful relationship with Emily while minimizing harm to Emily’s education, routine, and emotional well-being.

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order of May 15, 2021, and that modification is warranted;
B. Modify the Existing Order to eliminate the midweek Wednesday overnight visits and to change Defendant’s weekend parenting time as described in Section 7 above (or in a manner the Court deems in Emily’s best interests to account for Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire);
C. Order reasonable telephonic/video contact during the week and appropriate makeup time as set out in paragraph 7.1(c);
D. Require notice to the Court and Plaintiff and Court approval before Defendant effectuates any future relocation to another state or outside a reasonable driving distance that would affect parenting time, or require Defendant to file a relocation/modification motion prior to moving;
E. Award Plaintiff costs, fees, and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable; and
F. Grant such temporary relief as may be necessary pending final hearing on this Complaint.
