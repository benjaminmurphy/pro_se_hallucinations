      "support_reasoning": "Brown v. Kendall is a foundational Massachusetts negligence case, but it does not set out the modern, element-based formulation of negligence as duty, breach, and actual/proximate causation. Instead, it focuses on whether an unintentional injury occurring during a lawful act is actionable only upon proof of fault (lack of due care) and on who bears the burden of proving negligence. The opinion discusses due care, lawful acts, and contributory negligence, but it does not articulate the three-element structure or the causation concepts in the way the proposition states, so it does not directly support that specific elements test, though it is historically related to negligence doctrine.\n",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIf the act of hitting the plaintiff was unintentional, on the part of the defendant, and done in the doing of a lawful act, then the defendant was not liable, unless it was done in the want of exercise of due care, adapted to the exigency of the case, and therefore such want of due care became part of the plaintiff's case, and the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to establish it. \u2026 [W]hen the proof is all in \u2026 unless it also appears \u2026 that the defendant is chargeable with some fault, negligence, carelessness, or want of prudence, the plaintiff \u2026 is not entitled to recover.\u201d"

The case is cited only for its general discussion of foreseeability, relational duty, and proximate cause, not for any animal-related duty. Using Palsgraf as authority for a specific duty of animal owners under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 518 stretches the opinion beyond its subject matter and holding.",

It concerns a reporter\u2019s claimed constitutional and common-law privilege and the propriety of a summary criminal contempt finding.

Its treatment of tort issues concerns false imprisonment, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution, not duty, unreasonable risk, or landowner obligations. Therefore it does not provide authority for the proposition that Massachusetts courts recognize a landowner\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent injury in public areas.",

Polaroid further argues, in effect, that it was entitled to a directed verdict in its favor on the false imprisonment claim because the evidence did not warrant a finding that it detained Foley unreasonably."
