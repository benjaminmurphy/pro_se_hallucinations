COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

INTRODUCTION

1. This is an action for negligence arising out of personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff Jessica Harmon when a decayed/defective tree branch located on property owned and/or controlled by Defendant Thomas Richards fell onto Plaintiff while she was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s property.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff Jessica Harmon is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

3. Defendant Thomas Richards is, upon information and belief, the owner and/or person in control of the real property commonly known as 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201 (the “Property”).

4. The events giving rise to this Complaint occurred on August 15, 2023, at or near 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Venue and jurisdiction properly lie in the Berkshire Superior Court, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, possessed, occupied, controlled, and/or had the responsibility to maintain the Property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, including the yard and trees adjacent to the public sidewalk in front of the Property.

6. A large maple tree located in front of Defendant’s Property had, for a long period prior to August 15, 2023, a major branch that was visibly cracked, droopy, and appeared decayed or damaged (the “Cracked Branch”).

7. Plaintiff and other members of the neighborhood observed and noticed the Cracked Branch for an extended period prior to August 15, 2023. Neighbors similarly informed Defendant of the dangerous condition and recommended he have the tree inspected and/or removed/trimmed by an arborist. Defendant acknowledged the concern and stated he would “deal with it in the spring,” but failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, maintain, prune, treat, or remove the Cracked Branch.

8. On August 15, 2023, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm with no extreme or abnormal weather (no tornado warnings, no extraordinary windstorm), the Cracked Branch unexpectedly fractured and fell onto the public sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Property at or about the time Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the sidewalk carrying grocery bags.

9. The falling Cracked Branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back and knocked her to the ground.

10. As a direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, including but not limited to a shoulder strain and multiple bruises. Plaintiff sought and received medical treatment for her injuries. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $500 in wages due to missed work.

11. Plaintiff has experienced pain, suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, loss of the enjoyment of life, and other economic and non-economic damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

12. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or possessor of land owes to persons lawfully upon adjacent public ways a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent or abate dangerous conditions on the land that present an unreasonable risk of harm to such persons. A landowner must inspect, maintain, and, where appropriate, remove or secure hazardous conditions of which the landowner knows or reasonably should know and which present a foreseeable risk of injury to others. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 343, 343A, 324A; Mass. common law principles of negligence and premises liability.

14. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, control, inspection, maintenance, and safe condition of the trees, branches, and other vegetation located on the Property and extending over or adjacent to the public sidewalk.

15. Defendant breached that duty by acts and omissions including, but not limited to:
    a. Failing to inspect and discover the dangerous condition of the Cracked Branch when Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of its defective, cracked, and drooping condition;
    b. Failing to reasonably and timely trim, remove, or otherwise render safe the visibly cracked and hazardous Cracked Branch despite notice of the danger from neighbors and the passage of time sufficient to make repair or abatement feasible;
    c. Failing to hire or consult an arborist or other qualified person to inspect and assess the Cracked Branch or to take reasonable steps to prevent the hazard from injuring persons lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk;
    d. Otherwise negligently maintaining the Property in a dangerous condition.

16. Defendant’s breaches were a proximate cause of the Cracked Branch falling and striking Plaintiff, causing her injuries and damages.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury (including shoulder strain and multiple bruises), incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200, lost wages of approximately $500, suffered pain, disability, mental anguish, and other damages, and will continue to suffer damages in the future.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Harmon respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Richards as follows:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to:
    1. Past and future medical expenses;
    2. Past and future lost earnings and lost earning capacity;
    3. Past and future pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life;
    4. All other actual and consequential damages allowed by law;

B. Costs of suit, including filing fees and service costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law;

C. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. A trial by jury on all issues so triable; and

E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (Representative)
