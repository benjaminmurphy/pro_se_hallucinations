COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1.     INTRODUCTION

       1.1   Plaintiff Jenna Mitchell (“Plaintiff”), by way of this Complaint and pursuant to the
             common law of Massachusetts and applicable statutes and regulations, brings this
             action to recover damages for personal injuries and property damage caused by
             the negligence of Defendant Lynn Apartment Management LLC (“Defendant”), the
             landlord/manager responsible for maintenance of common-area smoke detectors
             at the multi-unit apartment building located at 100 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.

2.     PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

       2.1   Plaintiff Jenna Mitchell is an individual and resident of Lynn, Massachusetts. Her
             contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

       2.2   Defendant Lynn Apartment Management LLC is a limited liability company that
             manages and leases residential apartments located at 100 Maple Street, Lynn,
             Massachusetts 01905 and at all times relevant was the landlord or managing agent
             responsible for maintenance of the premises’ common areas and safety systems.

       2.3   This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts common law and statutory
             provisions governing personal injury and landlord duties. Venue is proper in Lynn
             District Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Lynn,
             Massachusetts.

       2.4   The amount of damages sought is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

3.     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

       3.1   Plaintiff resides on the third floor of a small multi-unit apartment building located at
             100 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

       3.2   Defendant is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common-area
             hallway smoke detectors and related fire safety equipment at the Premises.

       3.3   For several months prior to the incident described below, the smoke detector
             located in the hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s unit repeatedly emitted an
             audible “chirping” indicating a low battery condition.

       3.4   The low-battery chirping was ongoing for months, and Plaintiff reported the
             chirping and need for maintenance or battery replacement to Defendant on at least
             three separate occasions. On each occasion, Defendant acknowledged the
             complaint and represented that Defendant would “take care of it,” but Defendant
             failed to replace the smoke detector battery or otherwise restore the device to
             working order.

       3.5   At some point prior to the incident, an unknown person removed the battery from
             the hallway smoke detector and left the battery sitting on a nearby windowsill.
             The detector was therefore inoperable and incapable of detecting and warning
             residents of smoke or fire.

       3.6   On or about September 15, 2023, a fire originated in a first-floor apartment at the
             Premises due to an accidental kitchen-related ignition.

       3.7   Because the hallway smoke detector was inoperable (due to having no battery),
             the alarm did not sound and no alarm warning was provided to occupants of the
             upper floors, including Plaintiff.

       3.8   Plaintiff first became aware of the fire when she smelled smoke in the common
             hallway. By the time she attempted to exit the building, the hallway was already
             thick with smoke, and Plaintiff experienced significant difficulty breathing while
             evacuating.

       3.9   Plaintiff was transported to a hospital and spent the night there for treatment of
             smoke inhalation and respiratory distress.

       3.10  Plaintiff incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses and lost
             approximately $1,200 in wages as a result of her hospitalization and related care.
             In addition, Plaintiff’s personal property was damaged by smoke and water during
             firefighting efforts and cleanup.

       3.11  Defendant at all times knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have
             known of the condition of the hallway smoke detector and the risks posed by a
             nonfunctioning detector, including the foreseeable risk of personal injury and
             property damage in the event of a fire.

4.     NEGLIGENCE — GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

       4.1   Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1
             through 3.11 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

       4.2   At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff and other tenants a duty to maintain
             the common areas of the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to exercise
             reasonable care in the maintenance and repair of safety equipment, including
             smoke detectors and alarms.

       4.3   Defendant’s duties included, inter alia, the obligation to promptly respond to
             reports of malfunctioning smoke detectors and to keep all required smoke
             detection devices in operating condition in accordance with applicable statutes,
             codes and regulations (including, but not limited to, Massachusetts General Laws
             and the Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code).

       4.4   Defendant breached its duties by (a) failing to replace the battery or otherwise
             restore the inoperable hallway smoke detector to working order despite being put
             on notice of the malfunction on at least three occasions; (b) failing to ensure that
             all required smoke detectors were maintained and operable; and (c) failing to take
             reasonable measures to secure or repair the detector after the battery had been
             removed and left unsecured.

       4.5   Defendant’s breaches were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and
             damages because, but for Defendant’s failure to maintain an operable hallway
             smoke detector and its failure to respond reasonably to repeated complaints,
             Plaintiff would have received an earlier warning of the fire, could have evacuated
             with less exposure to smoke, and would have avoided or reduced the injuries and
             damages she sustained.

       4.6   As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered and
             continues to suffer physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress,
             aggravation of health, medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and other
             damages in an amount to be determined at trial but presently including at least
             $4,500 in medical expenses and $1,200 in lost wages, together with general and
             punitive damages and costs.

5.     APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

       5.1   The obligations of landlords to maintain common areas and to ensure safety
             devices function are grounded in Massachusetts common law principles of
             negligence and supported by statutes and regulations that govern fire safety and
             building standards, including but not limited to the following authorities:

             - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 148 (Fire Prevention); see generally provisions
               requiring fire safety measures and smoke detectors in dwelling units and
               multi-family dwellings.

             - 527 CMR (Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code) (promulgated by
               the Office of the State Fire Marshal), which establishes minimum requirements
               for fire alarm and detection systems in residential buildings.

             - 780 CMR (Massachusetts State Building Code), which sets standards for the
               construction, safety, and maintenance of buildings and life-safety systems.

             - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant), including landlord
               obligations regarding premises maintenance and tenant safety.

             - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health), which addresses conditions that may
               endanger public health and safety in buildings.

             - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282–288 (duty and negligence), §§ 302B,
               314A, and §§ 321–323 (duty to protect others, and landlord/occupier liability
               principles).

       5.2   Defendant’s failure to maintain the smoke detector and to respond to repeated
             complaints constitutes actionable negligence under Massachusetts law. See, e.g.,
             general premises-liability doctrines recognizing a landowner’s or occupier’s duty
             to exercise reasonable care to keep common areas and safety devices in a
             reasonably safe condition; duties include reasonable inspection, maintenance and
             repair of safety equipment.

       5.3   Plaintiff reserves the right to rely upon and to submit additional Massachusetts
             statutory and case authorities, and regulatory authorities, at trial and during
             litigation, as may be appropriate and as discovery develops.

6.     CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE (COUNT I)

       6.1   Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 5.3 as if fully
             set forth herein.

       6.2   Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises and
             common-area safety systems, including the hallway smoke detector outside
             Plaintiff’s unit.

       6.3   Defendant breached that duty by failing to maintain and repair the hallway smoke
             detector, failing to replace its battery or otherwise restore it to working order after
             being notified by Plaintiff on multiple occasions, and by failing to take reasonable
             actions to secure or repair the unit after the battery had been removed.

       6.4   Defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of the fire alarm not sounding, of
             Plaintiff’s exposure to smoke, of Plaintiff’s injuries (including smoke inhalation),
             of Plaintiff’s hospitalization, medical bills and lost wages, and of damage to
             Plaintiff’s personal property.

       6.5   As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered
             damages as set forth above and is entitled to recover compensatory damages in
             amounts to be proven at trial.

7.     DAMAGES

       7.1   As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered
             the following damages (non-exhaustive):

             (a)   Medical expenses: approximately $4,500;
             (b)   Lost wages: approximately $1,200;
             (c)   Property damage to personal belongings (amount to be established at trial);
             (d)   Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of
                   enjoyment of life;
             (e)   Costs of suit, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and
                   proper.

8.     PRAYER FOR RELIEF

       WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her
favor and against Defendant, and award Plaintiff the following relief:

       A.    Compensatory damages in an amount to be proved at trial, including, but not
             limited to, medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and general damages
             for pain and suffering;

       B.    Pre- and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

       C.    Costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law;

       D.    Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
