COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Hughes, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Quincy Casual Dining, LLC, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hughes is an individual resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Quincy Casual Dining, LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business as a casual dining restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169. At all relevant times Defendant owned, operated, managed, maintained, and controlled the restaurant premises located at that address.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on May 15, 2023 at the Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Quincy, Norfolk County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff was an invitee at the Defendant’s restaurant dining on the restaurant premises at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA.

6. At or about that time, in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray carrying several water glasses. Several glasses broke on the tile floor.

7. The server picked up the broken glass quickly but left water and ice on the tile floor. The server stated she would “be right back with a mop,” but she did not immediately clean the water and ice from the floor.

8. The server did not place any warning signs, cones, barriers, or other conspicuous warnings (including a wet floor sign) to alert patrons or other employees to the hazardous, wet condition of the hallway tile floor.

9. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff stood to walk to the restroom and proceeded along the hallway. The floor was wet; Plaintiff observed that the tile was glistening, but she did not appreciate the hazard until she stepped onto the wet area.

10. Plaintiff slipped on the wet tile, twisted her knee, and fell. The fall caused a painful knee injury.

11. After the fall, Plaintiff learned from overheard statements of other restaurant staff that staff had been “dodging that puddle” for some time before the fall, confirming the hazardous condition had existed and been known by employees.

12. Plaintiff sought medical treatment at urgent care where she was diagnosed with a sprained knee. As a result of the injury she was placed in a knee brace and was prescribed and completed a course of physical therapy. Plaintiff has experienced pain, suffering, and loss of function and incurred medical expenses and lost wages.

13. Plaintiff’s medical expenses related to the injury are approximately $3,500. Plaintiff’s lost wages are approximately $1,200.

14. The incident, injury, and Plaintiff’s damages were proximately caused by the negligence of the Defendant and its employees as set forth below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 above as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee, a duty to keep its premises reasonably safe, to exercise reasonable care for the safety of persons lawfully on the premises, to warn of dangerous conditions known to Defendant or discoverable by reasonable inspection, and to remedy hazards or provide adequate warnings. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A; Brown v. Kendall (recognizing duty of ordinary care in negligence).

17. Defendant, acting by and through its agents, servants and employees, breached the duties owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:

   a. failing to exercise reasonable care to discover and promptly correct or warn of a hazardous condition on the floor caused by spilled water and ice in the hallway between the kitchen and the dining room;

   b. failing to place a wet floor sign, cone, barrier, or other adequate warning to alert patrons and employees of the hazardous condition;

   c. allowing an unreasonably dangerous condition to persist for an unreasonable period of time (estimated at ten minutes or more) without remedial action despite knowledge of the spill and reports that staff had been “dodging that puddle;”

   d. negligently supervising, training, and/or retaining employees so that spills and broken glass were not promptly and properly cleaned and the area adequately secured or warned;

   e. otherwise negligently maintaining the premises.

18. Defendant’s breaches were the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, medical and related expenses, lost earnings, and other damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

19. Plaintiff was not negligent and did not cause or contribute to her injuries. Alternatively, if Plaintiff is found to have been negligent, any such negligence was slight compared to Defendant’s negligence, and under Massachusetts law any recovery should be reduced only in proportion to any comparative fault pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, past and future lost wages, and damages for pain and suffering, disability, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Award Plaintiff interest, costs, and disbursements of suit;

C. Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

RELEVANT LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Representative)

Plaintiff relies upon the general principles of negligence and premises liability recognized under Massachusetts law and in the Restatement. Representative authorities include, without limitation:
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land to invitees);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (liability for physical harm caused by condition on land);
- Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. ___ (19th century) (recognizing duty of ordinary care in negligence actions);
- Kallal v. City of Boston, 338 Mass. 25 (1958) (premises liability and duty to maintain safe conditions);
- Spear v. Boston & Maine R.R., 332 Mass. 81 (1955) (reasonable care and foreseeability);
- L.B. Foster Co. v. A & M Constr. Co., 402 Mass. 1 (1988) (proximate cause principles);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions);
- Prosser & Keeton on Torts (legal treatise on standards of care and premises liability);
- Additional Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court precedent interpreting premises liability, duty, notice, and causation principles (see, e.g., cases addressing constructive and actual notice, foreseeability, and the duty to warn and to clean hazards on business premises).

(Notes: Plaintiff will rely upon other controlling statutes, cases, and authorities as necessary and appropriate at trial. Citation to particular cases and treatises is intended to identify the general legal principles applicable to this negligence claim; Plaintiff reserves the right to cite and rely on additional Massachusetts and federal authorities pursuant to discovery and trial preparation.)

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for the relief set forth above.

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Jessica Hughes
