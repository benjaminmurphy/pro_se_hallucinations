Cardozo explicitly rejects liability where the defendant\u2019s conduct did not create an apparent risk to the particular plaintiff, emphasizing foreseeability and the need for a duty owed to that plaintiff. This squarely supports citing Palsgraf for proximate cause and foreseeability principles (often analogized to a privity-like limitation of duty).",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe conduct of the defendant\u2019s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus removed\u2026 The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension.\u201d"

It also contrasts this simplified approach with older, more technical pleading requirements. Thus, Conley directly supports the proposition that it is authority for notice pleading principles.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. \u2026 The decisive answer to this is that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To the contrary, all the Rules require is \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim\u2019 that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff\u2019s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d"

The case clearly stands for the plausibility pleading standard, but since no substantive proposition is articulated, I cannot say it supports the claimed proposition as stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In applying these general standards to a \u00a7 1 claim, we hold that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. Asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement."

Citing Hughes v. Boston for \u201cmunicipal/landowner duty principles\u201d is therefore inaccurate, as the case\u2019s holdings are about voting rights, domicile of prisoners, and procedural obligations of registrars, not duties of municipalities as landowners.",

If Olsen contains such a discussion, it is in another portion of the opinion, not in the excerpt provided, so based on this text alone it does not support the stated proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Collateral source evidence has been deemed irrelevant because \u201cthe receipts from the outside source do not go to reduce the defendant\u2019s liability; yet jurors might be led by the irrelevancy to consider plaintiffs\u2019 claims unimportant or trivial or to refuse plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts or reduce them, believing that otherwise there would be unjust double recovery.\u201d Goldstein v.
