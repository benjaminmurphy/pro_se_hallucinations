COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Emily Johnson
     Petitioner

v.                                                   Docket No.: ___________________

Michael Smith
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   a. Petitioner: Emily Johnson, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
   b. Respondent: Michael Smith, address unknown to petitioner for filing purposes but known to the Court.
   c. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of Massachusetts law governing modification of custody and parental responsibilities and under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), M.G.L. c. 209B, because the child is a resident of Massachusetts and the original order was entered in this Commonwealth.
   d. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the parties and the child reside in Middlesex County and the original custody order was entered in this Court.

2. Child Subject to This Action
   a. Lucas Smith (born in 2017), age 8, is the minor child subject to this Complaint.

3. Existing Order
   a. A prior custody order was entered on April 15, 2018, by this Court, awarding primary physical custody of the child to Petitioner and granting Respondent three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit. The 2018 order expressly prohibited overnight visits with Respondent.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   Petitioner alleges that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 order that warrants modification of the custody arrangement:
   a. Child’s Age and Needs: At the time of the 2018 order the child was three years old. The child is now eight years old, attending school full time, and has age-appropriate developmental needs and routines (including homework, structured bedtime, and school commitments) that make the short, frequent school-night visits ordered in 2018 disruptive to the child’s schooling, sleep, and homework routines.
   b. Respondent’s Housing: At the time of the 2018 order Respondent did not have adequate housing for overnight parenting time; he only had a room in a shared apartment with roommates. Since entry of the 2018 order, Respondent has obtained his own apartment and now has a bedroom available for the child. Petitioner has observed that the child would have his own bedroom when at Respondent’s residence.
   c. Child’s Expressed Preference and Stability Concerns: The child has consistently expressed an interest in having actual sleepovers at Respondent’s home rather than short non-overnight visits. Petitioner believes the current short-visit schedule—and the resulting frequent shuttling on school nights—negatively affects the child’s rest, homework completion, and school performance.
   d. Agreement Between Parents: Petitioner and Respondent both agree that the current schedule is not appropriate for the child’s present age and school schedule, and that a revised parenting-time schedule including overnights and reduced school-night exchanges would better serve the child’s needs.
   e. These changes are substantial and material to the child’s welfare and were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the 2018 order. The changes affect the child’s daily routines and the logistics of parenting time in a way that makes modification in the child’s best interests.

5. Basis for Relief Requested
   a. Under Massachusetts custody law, modification of an existing custody order is appropriate upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child. The facts described above establish a material change in circumstances since the entry of the 2018 order.
   b. The child’s best interests require a parenting-time schedule and custody arrangement that reflects the child’s present age, school schedule, and need for stable bedtime and homework routines while also allowing meaningful, safe, and regular contact with Respondent in light of Respondent’s improved housing circumstances.

6. Relief Requested
   Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:
   a. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the 2018 custody order that warrants modification of custody and parenting time;
   b. Modify the 2018 custody order to permit reasonable overnight parenting time with Respondent and to reorganize the parenting-time schedule so as to minimize school-night shuttling and to support the child’s consistent bedtime and homework routines;
      - Petitioner requests that the Court consider and enter an order providing: regular alternating overnight parenting time (for example, reasonable alternating weekends with overnight stays and/or a midweek overnight on a mutually agreed night that does not conflict with school), and a weekday schedule that eliminates multiple short school-night exchanges that disrupt the child’s school routine. Petitioner requests that the Court make any specific schedule adjustments it deems appropriate in the child’s best interests.
   c. Order such temporary relief as the Court deems appropriate pending final hearing (including temporary modification of parenting time to permit reasonable supervised or unsupervised overnights as the Court finds appropriate);
   d. Order that exchanges occur at a mutually convenient location or at a location the Court designates to minimize disruption to the child’s school and extracurricular schedule;
   e. Reserve jurisdiction to modify the order as needed to address the child’s changing needs; and
   f. Grant any other and further relief that the Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the child, including reasonable costs and any other relief relating to custody, parental access, and allocation of parenting time and responsibilities.

7. Request for Hearing and Service
   Petitioner requests that the Court schedule a hearing on this Complaint, issue a summons to Respondent, and order that Respondent be served with the Complaint and that Respondent appear and answer in accordance with Massachusetts law and court rules.

8. Good Faith Certification
   Petitioner certifies that this Complaint is filed in good faith and not for purposes of harassment or delay. Petitioner is prepared to cooperate in mediation, parenting coordination, or other dispute-resolution procedures the Court deems appropriate and in the child’s best interests.

Legal Authorities (for reference)
   Petitioner relies upon the governing Massachusetts law concerning child custody modification and jurisdiction, including the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), M.G.L. c. 209B, and the best-interests standard applied by Massachusetts courts in custody and parenting-time matters. Petitioner intends to rely upon controlling Massachusetts statutes and case law addressing modification of custody upon a material change in circumstances and the child’s best interests at hearing.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner Emily Johnson requests that this Court:
   1) Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the April 15, 2018 custody order;
   2) Modify the existing custody and parenting-time order to permit appropriate overnight visits and to restructure parenting time to reduce school-night shuttling and to serve the child’s best interests;
   3) Grant such temporary relief pending final hearing as the Court finds appropriate;
   4) Award such other relief as the Court deems equitable and in the best interests of the child.
