Palsgraf is a New York Court of Appeals decision about general negligence duty and foreseeability, in the context of railroad guards and a passenger on a platform, not motorists or Massachusetts law. While it articulates a general foreseeability-based duty principle, it does not address or establish the specific rule that Massachusetts imposes on motorists using public ways, so it cannot be cited as direct authority for that proposition of Massachusetts law.",
