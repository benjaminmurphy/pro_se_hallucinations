COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
MIDDLESEX COUNTY
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Samantha Reed,
    Plaintiff

v.                                                Docket No.: ___________

Kyle Turner,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff. Samantha Reed ("Plaintiff"), resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the primary physical custodian of the minor child identified below. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant. Kyle Turner ("Defendant") is the other parent of the child subject to this action.
1.3 Child. The subject child is Emily Turner, age 8.
1.4 Jurisdiction and venue. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law governing child custody matters and modification of custody orders, and venue is properly laid in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the parties and the child reside in this county and because the existing order was entered in the Middlesex area.

2. Existing Order
2.1 On April 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order (the "Existing Order") establishing that Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Emily Turner, and that Defendant has custody on Wednesdays (midweek overnight) and every other weekend. The Existing Order was entered based on the parties' then-current residences in the Cambridge area and the reasonable proximity of both parents to Emily's school and activities.

3. Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant has obtained new employment and intends to relocate to New Hampshire. The relocation will place Defendant’s residence approximately 90 minutes (each way) from Emily’s school in traffic during the Defendant’s scheduled midweek custody time.
3.2 Defendant has expressed an intention to keep the exact custodial schedule set by the Existing Order (including Wednesday midweek overnights) despite the planned relocation out of the Cambridge area.
3.3 The increased travel time and distance will require Emily to endure lengthy midweek overnight drives and early-morning return trips to attend school, which she is currently scheduled to attend in the Cambridge area.
3.4 Emily has exhibited increased anxiety about the long drives and about missing after-school activities and enrichment in connection with the proposed travel demands. Plaintiff has observed and documented changes in Emily’s mood and increased worry about midweek travel, and Plaintiff believes Emily’s school attendance and participation in after-school activities will be adversely affected if the midweek overnight arrangement remains in place.
3.5 The relocation and Defendant’s insistence on the same weeknight overnight arrangement constitute a material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order. The change substantially affects the child’s daily routine, school attendance, participation in extracurricular activities, and emotional well-being.

4. Legal Basis for Relief
4.1 Modification standard. Under Massachusetts law, modification of custody requires a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child and that the requested modification is in the child’s best interests. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B; and controlling Massachusetts authority interpreting those statutes and the best-interests standard.
4.2 Best interests of the child. In determining custody and modification, the Court must consider all relevant factors bearing on the child’s best interests, including stability, school attendance, extracurricular activities, the child’s wishes where appropriate, proximity to both parents to minimize disruption, and the mental and emotional health of the child. The circumstances described above materially interfere with these considerations and warrant modification to protect Emily’s best interests.

5. Relief Requested
Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order modifying the Existing Order as follows:
5.1 Permanently remove the midweek Wednesday overnight parental custody time from Defendant’s schedule (i.e., eliminate the Wednesday overnight), in light of Defendant’s relocation and the adverse impact of the required travel on Emily’s schooling, activities, and emotional well-being.
5.2 Adjust Defendant’s weekend custodial schedule to a practicable arrangement that recognizes the increased distance—for example, by (a) converting midweek custody time into additional weekend parenting time with a schedule that reduces midweek travel (such as two nonconsecutive overnights on weekends, or longer but less frequent weekend periods), or (b) ordering exchanges at an agreed-upon neutral location closer to Emily’s school to reduce travel time for Emily—whichever the Court finds to be in Emily’s best interests.
5.3 Make any further orders the Court deems appropriate to protect Emily’s schooling, extracurricular participation, and emotional well-being, including (but not limited to) reasonable transportation arrangements, coordination of school schedules, and monitoring or reunification services if the Court determines them necessary.
5.4 Grant Plaintiff temporary relief pending final hearing if the Court deems temporary modification necessary to prevent immediate harm to Emily (e.g., interim suspension of midweek overnights or temporary modification of exchange locations).
5.5 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs and any necessary findings regarding modification.

6. Factual Allegations Supporting Relief
6.1 Practical burdens of continued midweek overnights. The long travel time (approximately ninety minutes each way in typical traffic conditions) would routinely require Emily to be driven late at night and to return very early the next morning to attend school, resulting in sleep disruption and fatigue that will likely impair Emily’s learning and school performance.
6.2 Interference with extracurricular activities. Emily is currently enrolled in after-school activities and programs in the Cambridge area that are important to her social development. The proposed travel and midweek absences will force her to miss these activities or require scheduling changes that are not consistent with Emily’s needs or best interests.
6.3 Emotional impact. Emily has voiced anxiety and distress about the prospect of long drives and missing familiar routines and friends. Plaintiff has observed behavioral changes attributable to worry about midweek travel.
6.4 The requested modification is narrowly tailored. Plaintiff seeks a modification limited to eliminating the midweek overnight and adjusting weekend time in a manner that reduces travel burdens and fosters continuity in Emily’s school and social life. Plaintiff does not ask for a termination of Defendant’s parental rights or for elimination of all parenting time; rather, Plaintiff requests a reasonable reshaping of Defendant’s custodial time consistent with Emily’s best interests given the changed circumstances.

7. Request for Hearing
7.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint for Modification, and that the Court consider and, if warranted, enter temporary orders to protect the child’s immediate interests pending final resolution.

Authorities (statutes and other authorities relied upon)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutes governing divorce and child custody and modification)
  - See in particular provisions authorizing modification of custody orders and the Court’s authority to determine custody in the best interests of the child.

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (statutes addressing child welfare and the best interests of the child)

- Applicable Massachusetts caselaw interpreting the material change and best-interests standards for modification of custody orders (see, e.g., leading SJC and Appeals Court decisions addressing material change, stability, child welfare, and best interests).

(For purposes of briefing at hearing, Plaintiff will rely on statutory and controlling case law in support of the foregoing claims and will submit legal memoranda identifying and discussing controlling Massachusetts authorities interpreting the material change and best-interests standards. Plaintiff requests leave to file such memoranda and to present supporting evidence at the hearing.)
