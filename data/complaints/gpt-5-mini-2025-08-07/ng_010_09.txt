PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff" or "Ms. Johnson") is an individual and resident of Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant John Smith ("Defendant") is an adult individual who, upon information and belief, owns or occupies the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201 (the "Property") where the incident described below occurred. Defendant may be sued in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in Berkshire County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately the time described below, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of the Property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

6. At all material times, a large maple tree standing in the front yard of the Property had a major limb extending over the public sidewalk. For a long period prior to August 15, 2023, the branch appeared cracked, droopy, and weakened. Plaintiff and neighbors observed and noted the cracked condition.

7. Neighbors warned Defendant and informed Defendant of the visibly cracked and drooping condition of the branch and suggested that Defendant retain an arborist or otherwise inspect and remediate the hazardous branch. Defendant responded that he would "deal with it in the spring" but did not reasonably inspect, prune, remove, or otherwise make safe the dangerous limb prior to the incident.

8. On or about August 15, 2023, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm (not extraordinary weather, no tornado or similarly extreme advisory), while Plaintiff was walking on the public sidewalk with grocery bags, the visibly cracked major branch suddenly and without warning detached from the tree and fell onto Plaintiff's shoulder and back, knocking Plaintiff to the ground.

9. As a proximate result of the falling branch, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, required medical treatment, incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses, and lost approximately $400 in wages due to missing about one week of work at her retail job.

10. All of the foregoing conduct that injured Plaintiff was a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence and failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

11. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth herein.

12. At all times relevant to this action, Defendant owed a duty to members of the public, including lawful pedestrians using the public sidewalk, to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of his property and any trees located thereon so as to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 363 (duty and negligent performance of undertaking); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land with respect to dangerous conditions), and Massachusetts decisions recognizing landowner duties to invitees and the public.

13. Defendant breached the duty of care by, among other negligent acts and omissions: (a) allowing a major branch that was visibly cracked, drooping, and dangerous to remain in place over a public sidewalk; (b) failing to inspect, prune, remove, or otherwise reasonably remediate or warn of the dangerous condition of the tree or branch despite actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition; (c) ignoring repeated warnings and requests from neighbors to obtain an arborist or otherwise address the hazard; and (d) failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

14. The negligent acts and omissions of Defendant were the proximate and direct cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, physical pain, emotional distress, and other damages described herein.

15. Plaintiff suffered damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to: medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200; lost wages in the approximate amount of $400; physical pain and suffering; emotional distress; and all other damages allowable by law.

APPLICABLE LAW (AUTHORITIES)

16. The elements of a negligence claim are well established under Massachusetts law: a legal duty to conform to a certain standard of conduct, a breach of that duty, a reasonably close causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury, and actual loss or damage. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 281–285, 282, 343; Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140 (1976) (discussing negligence); and general Massachusetts negligence principles.

17. Massachusetts law recognizes the duty of landowners and occupiers to exercise reasonable care with respect to conditions on their property that foreseeably endanger others, including the maintenance of trees and branches that pose a hazard to pedestrians. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; see also Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140 (1976); cf. Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability in duty analysis) and other well-established authorities on duty and foreseeability.

18. Comparative negligence and apportionment principles apply in Massachusetts, allowing the trier of fact to allocate fault between plaintiff and defendant(s), if any, as provided by statute and case law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85 (apportionment and comparative negligence principles) and cases interpreting comparative negligence principles in Massachusetts.

19. The statute of limitations for personal injury actions in Massachusetts is three years from the date of cause of action, as set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A. The present action is timely filed because the incident occurred on August 15, 2023, and this Complaint is filed within the statutory period.

20. Plaintiff relies also upon customary tort authorities and treatises on duty, negligence, and premises liability including Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283, 323, 343, and relevant Massachusetts decisions interpreting those principles. Representative authorities and supporting authorities include, but are not limited to:
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A;
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85;
   - Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140 (1976);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283, 323, 343 (Am. Law Inst.);
   - Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability/duty);
   - Prosser & Keeton on Torts (general treatise authority);
   - Additional Massachusetts precedent addressing landowner/possessor duties and negligence (see e.g., cases interpreting premises liability and foreseeability principles under Massachusetts law).

(For purposes of pleading, Plaintiff will supplement and elaborate authority and citations as discovery proceeds and as required by the Court.)

DAMAGES

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injury, pain, suffering, medical expenses (approximately $1,200), lost income (approximately $400), and other consequential damages, and is entitled to recover all such damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Notes and Practical Considerations (for Plaintiff’s benefit)
- The Complaint pleads a single cause of action for negligence as requested.
- The Complaint identifies the time, place, parties, injuries, and damages you provided.
- You should promptly effect service of process on Defendant and file a civil action cover sheet and required court forms with the Berkshire Superior Court clerk’s office.
- Preserve all evidence (photos of the tree and scene, notices from neighbors, medical records, wage documentation) and obtain any available witness statements from neighbors who observed the cracked limb or who spoke with Defendant.
- Consider consulting an attorney for advice on litigation strategy, further tailoring of legal citations, and to ensure compliance with local rules and requirements (filing fees, forms, electronic filing, etc.). If you remain proceeding pro se, review the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and local rules for Superior Court.
