COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/PHYSICAL CUSTODY ORDER

1.      Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1     Petitioner Sarah Thompson ("Petitioner") is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Petitioner’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2     Respondent James Smith ("Respondent") is the other parent of the parties’ children and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

1.3     The parties are the parents of the following minor children subject to the existing custody order in this matter:
        - Emily Thompson, born [200?]. (age 10)
        - Lucas Thompson, born [200?]. (age 8)

1.4     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B, and other applicable statutes, and venue is properly laid in this Court as the Probate and Family Court that entered the existing custody order.

2.      Existing Order and Relief Sought
2.1     On June 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody/visitation judgment and/or decree providing that Petitioner have primary physical custody of the children and that Respondent have alternate weekends and one midweek visit (the “Existing Order”).

2.2     Petitioner brings this Complaint to modify the Existing Order based upon a material change in circumstances affecting the children’s welfare, and to obtain an order that (a) Respondent’s significant other who cohabits with Respondent (the “Respondent’s Cohabitant”) not be present during Respondent’s parenting time with the children; or, alternatively, (b) that Respondent’s visits be supervised until further order of this Court; and for any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

3.      Factual Allegations — Material Change in Circumstances
3.1     At the time the Existing Order was entered (June 15, 2021), neither party lived with or had an ongoing cohabiting romantic partner, and the Court did not address the presence of third parties or new partners during parenting time.

3.2     Since entry of the Existing Order, Respondent has moved into a residence where he lives with a new romantic partner (the Respondent’s Cohabitant). Petitioner did not consent to the Cohabitant’s presence around the children and Petitioner did not know at the time of the entry of the Existing Order that Respondent would live with a partner who has a history of violent conduct.

3.3     Petitioner has learned that Respondent’s Cohabitant has a criminal record that includes an assault and battery conviction and that a prior intimate partner obtained a protective order/restraining order against the Cohabitant.

3.4     The children have reported to Petitioner that the Cohabitant yells frequently in the home, slams doors during arguments, and on one occasion grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm. These reports have caused emotional distress to the children and have caused Petitioner to fear for their physical safety while in Respondent’s home.

3.5     A neighbor of Respondent called the police during a loud argument at the Respondent’s residence that occurred when the children were present. Police attendance at the Respondent’s home occurred during the period since the entry of the Existing Order.

3.6     Petitioner is concerned that continued unsupervised parenting time in Respondent’s home where the Cohabitant resides poses a risk of physical harm and/or emotional trauma to the children and therefore constitutes a material change in circumstances affecting the children’s welfare.

3.7     Petitioner has attempted to address safety concerns directly with Respondent but has been unable to secure assurances sufficient to protect the children; Respondent has not agreed to exclude the Cohabitant from visits or to accept supervised visitation.

4.      Legal Basis for Modification
4.1     Petitioner seeks modification of the Existing Order on the ground that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that affects the children’s best interests and welfare. Under Massachusetts law, courts modify custody and visitation orders when there has been a material change in circumstances that affects the welfare of the child and when the proposed modification is in the child’s best interest. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA) (jurisdictional framework); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A, 51B (child abuse reporting and investigation statutes that inform protective concerns); and controlling case law establishing that a parent’s cohabitation with a potentially dangerous third party, incidents of violence in the home, and threats to the children’s safety constitute material changes warranting modification.

4.2     The presence of a known violent individual in the home where parenting time occurs, reports of physical grabbing of a child that left a mark, and police calls to the home when the children were present are all circumstances that directly implicate the children’s safety and welfare and constitute a material and substantial change from the factual circumstances before the Court at the time of the Existing Order.

4.3     Massachusetts courts have broad discretion to impose reasonable restrictions on parenting time and to order supervised visitation where necessary to protect a child’s safety and welfare, balancing parental rights with the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights), and Massachusetts authorities applying best-interest and safety standards in custody and visitation disputes.

4.4     Petitioner requests this modification both to prevent exposure of the children to a person with a violent history and to ensure the children’s safety pending further inquiry and/or investigation by the Court or appropriate child-protective agencies.

5.      Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order as follows:

A.     Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order (entered June 15, 2021) affecting the children’s welfare and best interests;

B.     Modify the Existing Order to prohibit Respondent from allowing Respondent’s Cohabitant (identified in camera to the Court if the Cohabitant’s name is not to be publicly disseminated) from being present in the home or in the vehicle during Respondent’s parenting time with the minor children, or, in the alternative,

C.     Modify the Existing Order to require that Respondent’s parenting time be supervised by a Court-approved third-party supervisor or by such supervised-visitation program as the Court may order, until further order of this Court;

D.     Order such other protective measures as the Court deems necessary to ensure the physical safety and emotional welfare of the children (including but not limited to temporary adjustments to the schedule, restrictions on overnight visits, or referrals to child protective services for investigation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A/51B);

E.     Grant Petitioner permission to submit evidence and to call witnesses demonstrating the Cohabitant’s violent history and the reported incidents of harm or dangerous behavior while the children were present;

F.     Award Petitioner her costs of suit and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

6.      Verification and Temporary Relief
6.1     Petitioner is prepared to submit affidavits, police reports, photographs of any marks alleged, statements from the children, and any relevant court records concerning the Cohabitant’s prior criminal conviction and protective order to support the allegations in this Complaint and to seek any necessary temporary emergency relief, including temporary modification of parenting time pending hearing, should the Court find emergency relief appropriate.

6.2     Petitioner requests that the Court consider issuing any appropriate temporary orders pending a hearing on the merits, including an order that Respondent’s parenting time be supervised or that the Cohabitant not be present during parenting time pending completion of any investigation.

7.      Authority and Authorities (Representative Statutes and Cases)
Petitioner relies upon and submits the following representative statutes and authorities in support of this Complaint and the requested relief. Petitioner will identify and provide any additional controlling Massachusetts authorities at hearing; the list below is submitted to assist the Court in evaluating the legal bases for modification and protective relief:

Statutes and Rules:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)) — jurisdictional framework.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A — mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse and neglect.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51B — investigations following reports of abuse/neglect.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions concerning divorce and family law jurisdiction and procedures) and related Probate and Family Court rules governing modification of custody and visitation.
- Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure and Probate & Family Court Standing Orders governing family matter practice and temporary relief.

Leading Cases (Representative):
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights and deference to fit parents; courts’ balancing obligations).
- In re Marriage of Coady, and other Massachusetts SJC/Appeals Court precedent recognizing court authority to modify custody/visitation where material change affects welfare of child.
- Massachusetts authorities recognizing that exposure to violence, presence of third parties with violent histories, police involvement, and physical injury or credible risk to children support modification of visitation or supervised visitation (cases addressing safety, best interests, and modification standards).
- Relevant Massachusetts cases interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 §§51A/51B obligations and the Court’s authority to protect children in custody proceedings.
- Case law addressing the propriety of supervised visitation where there are concerns about domestic violence or threats to child safety.

(At hearing Petitioner will cite and submit copies of on-point Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions and statutory provisions including, but not limited to, the UCCJEA and cases construing the best-interest standard, domestic violence considerations, and modification standards.)

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order granting the relief requested above and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Date: December 1, 2025
