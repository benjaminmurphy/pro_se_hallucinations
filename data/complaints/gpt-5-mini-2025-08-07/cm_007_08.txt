I can draft a full Complaint for Modification of Custody for you, but I cannot invent or fabricate case names or statute section numbers. I will therefore provide a complete, properly formatted Complaint with factual allegations, requested relief, and all standard sections. Where a lawyer would ordinarily insert precise statutory and case citations, I will identify the legal standards and where to place citations, and I strongly recommend you (or an attorney) add the exact statutory and case citations before filing. If you want, I can also draft a version that leaves blank lines for exact citations for your attorney to fill in.

Below is the Complaint for Modification of Custody based on the facts you provided. Please review carefully and have it reviewed by counsel or the court clerk for required local formatting and to add precise citations and any required verification/affidavit language before filing.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BRISTOL COUNTY
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Laura Thompson
Plaintiff

v.                                                  Docket No. ____________

James Thompson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

1. Parties
1.1 Plaintiff Laura Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Ms. Thompson") is an adult resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff's contact information for purposes of service and notices is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant James Thompson ("Defendant" or "Mr. Thompson") is an adult who is a parent of the minor child identified below and is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1 Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the parties and the minor child reside in Bristol County and the original custody order was entered in this court.

2.2 This Court has jurisdiction to modify custody and parenting time established by prior court order under Massachusetts law governing custody modifications and the court's general continuing jurisdiction over custody determinations.

3. The Minor Child
3.1 The minor child subject to this action is Emily Thompson, age 12 (born in approximately 2013), hereafter "the Child."

4. Prior Order
4.1 On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order providing for joint physical custody of the Child with an alternating week (one week on/one week off) schedule (the "2018 Order").

4.2 The 2018 Order reflected the parties' circumstances at that time, including that both parties lived nearby and were physically able to care for the Child, and that the alternating-week schedule was in the Child's best interests.

5. Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 Since entry of the 2018 Order, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred that affects the Child's health, safety, and welfare.

5.2 Specifically, within the past several years Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has caused significant decline in his mobility and physical stability. Defendant now uses a wheelchair and requires assistance to move safely in his residence.

5.3 Defendant has had multiple falls in his home. On multiple occasions Defendant has fallen in areas where there are stairs or where rapid physical response would be required to prevent injury to a small child. Defendant's treating physician has advised Defendant that he should not be alone with the Child in situations involving stairs or where quick physical assistance might be required.

5.4 Despite the diagnosis and medical advice, Defendant insists on maintaining the existing alternating-week physical custody schedule. Plaintiff has observed Defendant relying upon the Child, who is 12 years old, to assist him with transfers (including helping him from wheelchair to bed) and to bring him objects, tasks that are inappropriate for the Child and create risk to her safety.

5.5 Plaintiff has requested that Defendant accept a revised parenting schedule tailored to his present capacities and to protect the Child's safety, including supervision when Defendant has physical custody. Defendant has refused to agree to reasonable accommodations.

5.6 The Child has been placed in situations that make Plaintiff reasonably fear for the Child's safety and welfare given Defendant's physical limitations, history of falls, and reliance on the Child for tasks beyond the Child's age-appropriate responsibilities.

6. Best Interests of the Child
6.1 The Child's safety, welfare, and best interests require a custody and parenting-time arrangement that takes into account Defendant's progressive neurological condition, the risk of falls and injury, and the fact that the Child should not be required to act as a caregiver for an adult parent.

6.2 Continued strict adherence to the alternating-week schedule without accommodations places the Child at risk and is no longer in the Child's best interests.

7. Relief Requested — Modification Sought
7.1 Plaintiff seeks a modification of the 2018 Order to a parenting plan and custody arrangement structured as follows (requested relief is stated with specificity but may be adjusted by the Court as justice requires):

a. Primary Physical Custody: Award primary physical custody of the Child to Plaintiff, with Plaintiff's residence to be the child's primary residence for school and other purposes.

b. Reasonable Parenting Time for Defendant: Establish a parenting-time schedule that reflects Defendant's capacities and the Child's safety, such as:
   - Defendant to have parenting time on alternate weekends and specified weekday evening time tailored so that Defendant is never solely responsible for care in situations involving stairs or other physical hazards.
   - Any overnight parenting time to occur only when Defendant is accompanied by a capable adult who has been approved by Plaintiff or by the Court (or when Defendant can demonstrate medical clearance and safe functioning as determined by a medical professional).
   - All parenting time while Defendant is alone with the Child shall exclude activities involving stairs, bathing, lifting/transfers, or other physical tasks that exceed Defendant's demonstrated safe capacity.

c. Supervision or Support: To the extent the Court finds it necessary for the Child's safety, the Court order that Defendant's time with the Child be supervised, or that Defendant arrange for a responsible adult to be present during those periods (at Defendant's expense), or utilize a defined list of safe activities and locations where Defendant can care for the Child without exposure to known hazards.

d. Medical and Safety Orders: Require Defendant to provide updated medical documentation of his functional abilities and any limitations to both the Plaintiff and the Court, and to notify Plaintiff and the Court promptly of any significant change in his medical condition.

e. Guardian ad Litem / Child Advocate: In the Court’s discretion, appointment of a guardian ad litem or child advocate to investigate and report concerning the Child’s best interests.

f. Temporary Relief Pending Final Hearing: Order temporary modification of the 2018 Order immediately, granting Plaintiff primary physical custody and the protective parenting-time measures stated above pending final hearing, if the Court finds interim relief appropriate to protect the Child.

g. Other Relief: Any other relief the Court deems necessary to protect the Child's safety and promote her best interests, including costs and fees as permitted by law.

8. Legal Basis for Modification (Legal Standard)
8.1 Under Massachusetts family law, a court may modify an existing custody order upon showing a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order and a demonstration that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child.

8.2 Plaintiff asserts that the facts alleged in Paragraphs 5 and 6 — including Defendant’s progressive neurological condition, his history of falls, medical advice limiting his ability to be alone with the Child in certain situations, and his reliance on the minor child to perform physically demanding or caregiving tasks — constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification.

8.3 Plaintiff requests that the Court apply the statutory and case law standards for modification of custody (material change + best interests) and consider the safety, health, and developmental needs of the Child.

(Place for counsel/filing party to insert specific statutory and case citations that support the above legal standard and application — e.g., Massachusetts statutes and Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions articulating the material-change requirement and the "best interests of the child" standard. Recommend that the following authorities be added and verified by counsel: applicable provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws regarding custody and modification, rules of the Probate and Family Court, and leading SJC/Appeals Court decisions on custody modification and best-interests analysis.)

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:

9.1 Modify the 2018 custody order dated May 15, 2018, as set forth above and award primary physical custody of the Child to Plaintiff;

9.2 Enter a parenting-time schedule for Defendant consistent with Defendant’s current physical capacities and the Child’s safety, and order supervision or presence of an adult during Defendant’s parenting time when necessary;

9.3 Order Defendant to provide current medical documentation regarding his diagnosis, prognosis, and functional limitations and to update the Court promptly upon significant medical changes;

9.4 Appoint a guardian ad litem or child advocate if the Court deems appropriate;

9.5 Grant temporary relief as necessary to protect the Child pending final hearing;

9.6 Award any other relief the Court deems just and proper, including costs or fees if permitted; and

9.7 Order such further hearings as the Court finds necessary.

10. Certificate of Service
I certify that on a copy of this Complaint was served on the Defendant by [method of service—personal service/registered mail/etc.] on [date — leave blank to fill in], and that proof of service will be filed with the Court.

Respectfully submitted,

Address for Service:
[Plaintiff’s address — add before filing if required by court rules]

Signature block and contact details for Plaintiff are included above. Insert a line for the Court to fill Docket No. and add any required verification or affidavit language per local rules (many probate and family courts require an affidavit verifying facts and verification re: service and the content of the pleading).

Important notes and next steps
- Before filing: confirm local court form and filing requirements for the Bristol County Probate and Family Court (cover sheet, verification, child impact statement, filing fee or fee waiver, and any required certificate of service form).
- Medical evidence: attach to the Complaint or file as exhibits (or be prepared to produce at hearing) any medical documentation from Defendant’s physician that establishes limitations and recommendations concerning unsupervised time with the Child.
- Guardian ad litem: if you request appointment, prepare a short proposed order and the grounds to support that appointment.
- Legal citations: Because I mustn't invent or fabricate legal authorities, I did not insert exact statute sections and case citations here. Massachusetts law requires proof of a material change in circumstances and a best-interests showing to modify custody; please have an attorney or trusted legal resource supplement this Complaint with the precise statutory and case citations you wish to rely upon. If you would like, I can produce a list of commonly-cited Massachusetts authorities and sample language indicating where to place them, but you should have a lawyer or legal reference verify and insert the exact citations.

If you want, I can:
- create a version that includes a blank “Authorities” section where your attorney can insert precise statute and case citations; or
- provide a recommended list of Massachusetts statutes and well-known SJC/Appeals Court decisions commonly cited in custody modification matters (to be verified by counsel); or
- convert this Complaint into a court form template if you tell me which specific Probate and Family Court form set you need.

Would you like me to prepare one of those follow-up items?
