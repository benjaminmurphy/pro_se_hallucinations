While unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment is implicit in the facts, the case\u2019s doctrinal basis is habitability, not the covenant of quiet enjoyment, so it does not directly support the stated proposition.",

This warranty of habitability is implied in tenancies for a specific period or at will."
