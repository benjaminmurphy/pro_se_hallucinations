COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Rodriguez, and for her Complaint against Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc., alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez is an individual and at all times relevant to this Complaint was a resident of Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation doing business in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operating a grocery store at 123 Main St., Somerville, MA 02143, where the events giving rise to this action occurred.

3. The incident that is the subject of this Complaint occurred on September 16, 2023, at Defendant’s premises located at 123 Main St., Somerville, MA 02143, which is within the jurisdiction of this Court. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law for personal injury and damages arising out of negligence.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On Saturday afternoon, September 16, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on Defendant’s premises shopping in the dairy aisle.

6. A puddle of spilled milk was present on the floor of the dairy aisle. The spill was not de minimis; it was large enough that one could see shopping cart tracks through it.

7. There were no warning signs, cones, or other marks cautioning customers about a wet floor or the presence of the spilled milk.

8. Approximately fifteen feet away from the spill an employee of Defendant was stocking shelves. After Plaintiff fell, the employee stated that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing what he was doing before getting the mop.

9. Plaintiff stepped into the puddle, slipped and fell hard onto her hip. Plaintiff initially continued shopping but experienced escalating pain later that night.

10. On September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought treatment at urgent care and was diagnosed with a hip sprain. Plaintiff was referred for and underwent physical therapy to treat the hip sprain.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $800 in wages due to missed shifts at her café job while recovering. Plaintiff also suffered pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, occupied, controlled, maintained and/or had responsibility for the grocery store premises located at 123 Main St., Somerville, MA 02143, including the dairy aisle where Plaintiff fell.

14. As owner/occupier/controller of the premises, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees, including Plaintiff, and to warn of latent or hidden dangers known to Defendant or that Defendant reasonably should have known.

15. Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:
   a. Failing to discover or inspect for hazardous conditions on the premises in a reasonably prudent manner;
   b. Failing to remove or remediate a hazardous condition (the spilled milk) in a reasonably timely manner after the condition existed or after Defendant had notice or constructive notice of the condition;
   c. Failing to place adequate warnings, signs, cones, or other alerts to notify invitees of the hazardous condition; and
   d. Failing to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, maintenance, and operation of the premises.

16. The spilled milk on the floor created an unreasonable risk of harm to customers lawfully on the premises. The risk of harm was foreseeable to Defendant or its employees.

17. Defendant had actual notice of the spilled milk—an employee admitted he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago”—and/or constructive notice because the spilled milk had been on the floor sufficiently long that it could have been discovered by a reasonably diligent inspection and correction policy. Defendant’s failure to act upon actual or constructive notice constituted negligence.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining a hip sprain that required medical treatment and physical therapy, incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200, suffered lost wages of approximately $800, and suffered pain, suffering, disability, and other damages.

19. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable results of Defendant’s negligent maintenance and supervision of the premises.
