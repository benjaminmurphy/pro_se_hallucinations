COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

INTRODUCTION

1.     Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") brings this action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of Defendant FreshMart Grocery Store’s negligence in failing to maintain safe premises and to warn of a hazardous condition on its premises.

PARTIES

2.     Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and a resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

3.     Defendant FreshMart Grocery Store ("Defendant") is a grocery store doing business at and operating the premises located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this complaint, Defendant owned, occupied, leased, managed and/or controlled the premises where the incident described below occurred.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4.     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Middlesex County and the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of the Superior Court.

5.     Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1 and related venue provisions because the incident occurred in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and Defendant’s place of business is located in Middlesex County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6.     On September 9, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant, shopping in the dairy aisle at Defendant's store located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

7.     At that time and place, there was a substantial puddle of spilled milk in the dairy aisle. The puddle was large enough that cart tracks were visible through it.

8.     There were no warning cones, barricades, wet-floor signs, or other warnings or barriers placed around the puddle to alert customers to the hazard.

9.     An employee of Defendant was in the vicinity (approximately fifteen feet away) stocking shelves. After Plaintiff fell, the employee admitted he had noticed the spill "a few minutes ago" but had been finishing his task and had not yet gone to get the mop.

10.    Plaintiff stepped into the puddle, slipped and fell hard onto her hip. She completed her shopping but experienced increasing hip pain later that night.

11.    On September 10, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility and was diagnosed with a hip sprain. Plaintiff was prescribed and attended a course of physical therapy.

12.    As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses, lost approximately $1,500 in wages due to missed shifts at her place of employment, and suffered pain, disability, and loss of enjoyment of life.

13.    Plaintiff timely presents this claim for negligence, as further alleged below.

GOVERNING LAW

14.    Plaintiff’s claim is grounded in the common law duty of care owed by a possessor of land to invitees to use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of hidden dangers. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (1965) (possession of land; duty to invitees); Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (establishing modern duty principles); Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability as an element of duty and proximate cause).

15.    Under Massachusetts law, a proprietor has a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep its aisles safe for business invitees and to warn of dangerous conditions of which it had actual knowledge or constructive notice. See Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 404 Mass. 665 (1989) (discussing proof required to establish constructive notice of a hazardous condition on premises); see also Restatement (Second) Torts § 343A cmt. b (1965).

16.    Comparative negligence principles apply to the apportionment of fault in Massachusetts. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85; see also Massachusetts appellate authority applying comparative negligence principles.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

17.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.

18.    At all times relevant to this complaint, Plaintiff was an invitee on Defendant's premises.

19.    Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees, and to warn invitees of dangers that Defendant knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known about. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A; Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 404 Mass. 665 (1989); see also Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 61 (5th ed.) (treatise discussing landowner liability).

20.    Defendant breached that duty by allowing a substantial puddle of milk to remain in a customer aisle without providing any warnings (such as cones or wet-floor signs), and by failing to mop up or otherwise remedy the hazardous condition in a timely manner despite having an employee near the spill who admitted noticing it "a few minutes" earlier.

21.    The existence of cart tracks through the spill and the employee’s admission that the spill had been noticed for several minutes are circumstantial evidence that the condition existed for sufficient time that Defendant had constructive notice of it and failed to remedy it. See Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 404 Mass. 665 (1989) (discussing use of circumstantial evidence to establish constructive notice); see also Restatement (Second) Torts § 343A cmt. b.

22.    Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. The fall and resulting hip sprain, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages were foreseeable consequences of allowing a puddle in a customer aisle without warning. See Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928).

23.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200, lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,500, and has otherwise been damaged and deprived of the use and enjoyment of her life and activities.

24.    Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries and damages claimed, and that any negligence on Plaintiff’s part is comparatively minor or not at all, such that Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages and that any reduction for comparative negligence should be governed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85.

25.    Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s conduct was negligent, careless, and reckless and was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A.     Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses (currently approximately $1,200), past and future lost wages and earnings capacity (currently approximately $1,500), and damages for pain and suffering, disability, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B.     Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

C.     Costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable;

D.     Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
