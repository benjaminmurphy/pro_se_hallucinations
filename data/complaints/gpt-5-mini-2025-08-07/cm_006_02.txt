COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BRISTOL COUNTY
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Rachel Thompson,
    Plaintiff

v.                                              Docket No.: __________

Mark Johnson,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   1.1 Plaintiff Rachel Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Mother") is an adult resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2 Defendant Mark Johnson ("Defendant" or "Father") is an adult resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.
   1.3 This Court has subject-matter and personal jurisdiction over this matter under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, M.G.L. c. 209B, because the children are residents of Massachusetts and the prior custody order was entered in this Commonwealth.
   1.4 The prior custody/parenting order that is the subject of this Petition was entered on May 15, 2020, in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court. The current parenting arrangement grants Plaintiff primary physical custody of the parties' children, Emily Thompson (age 8) and Noah Thompson (age 6), and grants Defendant alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

2. Relief Requested
   2.1 Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody/visitation order pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208 and other applicable law on the ground that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order and that modification is in the best interests of the children.
   2.2 Specifically, Plaintiff requests:
       a. Temporary and then permanent modification ordering that Defendant's parenting time be conditioned so that Defendant's live-in partner (hereinafter "the Partner") is not present in the children’s presence during Defendant’s visits; OR, in the alternative,
       b. That all of Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by an approved third-party supervised visitation provider until further order of the Court.
       c. That the Court order the Probate & Family Court to conduct any necessary fact-finding (including testimony, child interviews if appropriate, and consideration of any prior criminal and restraining-order history) and that the Court enter such further or different orders as are just and proper for the protection, safety, and welfare of Emily and Noah.
       d. Any other relief the Court deems necessary, including the ordering of a 51A report or referral to appropriate child-protective services if the Court deems it appropriate, and the assessment of costs and fees as authorized by law.

3. Factual Allegations (Material Change in Circumstances)
   3.1 At the time the current custody order was entered on May 15, 2020, neither party was in a serious, long-term dating relationship and there were no court-ordered restrictions regarding third persons in the home during parenting time.
   3.2 Since entry of the order, Defendant has begun cohabiting with a new partner. Plaintiff did not learn the identity of the partner at the time the parties' order was entered and the partner is not referenced in the existing order.
   3.3 Plaintiff has recently learned and reasonably believes the following facts concerning the Partner:
       a. The Partner has a criminal history which includes an assault and battery conviction.
       b. The Partner was the subject of a prior civil restraining order entered at the request of a former partner.
   3.4 The children have reported to Plaintiff that, while visiting Defendant’s home with the Partner present, the Partner yells loudly; slams doors; and on one occasion grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a visible mark on the child's arm.
   3.5 A neighbor called the police due to a loud argument occurring in Defendant’s home while the children were present during a recent visit.
   3.6 Plaintiff believes and alleges that the Partner's presence and conduct in Defendant's home creates a real and immediate risk to the children's physical and emotional safety and well-being, and that the presence of the Partner during parenting time has materially changed the circumstances under which the original custody order was entered.
   3.7 Plaintiff alleges she has a reasonable basis to fear for the children's safety during unsupervised parenting time in Defendant’s home while the Partner is present, and that continued unsupervised parenting time under these circumstances is contrary to the children's best interests.

4. Legal Basis for Modification
   4.1 Plaintiff alleges a material change in circumstances warranting modification of custody and/or visitation orders, and that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the children.
   4.2 Plaintiff relies on the governing legal standards under Massachusetts law that (a) a court may modify a prior custody or visitation order upon a showing of material change in circumstances and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child(ren), and (b) the protection and welfare of a child is a paramount consideration in custody and visitation determinations.
   4.3 Plaintiff further relies on the Court’s authority to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time, including requiring the exclusion of particular persons from parenting time visits or requiring supervised visitation, where necessary to protect the child's welfare.

5. Temporary Emergency Relief Requested
   5.1 Given the allegations of physical grabbing that left a mark, yelling and door-slamming in the children's presence, and a neighbor's report to police, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter ex parte temporary emergency relief pending hearing and determination on the merits, specifically:
       a. An order temporarily suspending Defendant’s unsupervised parenting time until a hearing can be held; or
       b. An order that Defendant’s parenting time be supervised pending hearing; and
       c. Any reasonable conditions the Court deems necessary to protect the children (for example, restricting who may be present in the home during parenting time, prohibiting alcohol or illegal drugs during parenting time, or requiring compliance with a supervised visitation center's rules).

6. Notice and Service
   6.1 Plaintiff will serve a copy of this Complaint and all supporting documents on Defendant by personal service or as otherwise authorized by the Massachusetts Rules and the Probate & Family Court rules.

7. Reservation of Rights
   7.1 Plaintiff reserves the right to introduce further evidence at hearing, to request an evidentiary hearing, to request protective orders as appropriate, and to seek such other relief as justice may require.

Legal Authorities (Representative)
   Plaintiff relies on the following statutes and authorities, among others:
   - M.G.L. c. 208 (statutory provisions concerning divorce, custody determinations, and modification of custody provisions);
   - M.G.L. c. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — jurisdictional rules);
   - M.G.L. c. 119, §51A (duty to report suspected child abuse and neglect);
   - M.G.L. c. 209C (child support enforcement provisions) — as applicable to enforcement and modification matters;
   - Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Rules and the Domestic Relations Practice rules governing custody/visitation modifications and emergency relief.
   Plaintiff also cites the controlling standards and precedent established by Massachusetts appellate courts on modification of custody and visitation orders and the best-interests-of-the-child inquiry, including but not limited to decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and the Appeals Court recognizing the requirement of a material change in circumstances and the authority of the Probate and Family Court to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time to protect children's welfare. See, e.g.:
   - Cases and authorities addressing material change in circumstances and best-interests standard and the court’s authority to condition parenting time (representative decisions and authorities of the Massachusetts courts): see, e.g., Custody and visitation modification decisions and precedents interpreting M.G.L. and the court’s authority to fashion supervised visitation or exclusion of third persons from parenting time where child safety is implicated.

(If the Court prefers, Plaintiff will provide an expanded list of specific controlling Massachusetts appellate decisions and statutory subsections at or before the hearing.)

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
   1. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2020 custody order, and that modification is in the best interests of Emily and Noah;
   2. Temporarily suspend Defendant's unsupervised parenting time pending a hearing, or, in the alternative, order that all Defendant's parenting time be supervised until further order of the Court;
   3. Permanently modify the existing custody/visitation order to either (a) prohibit the presence of Defendant's live-in Partner during any parenting time or (b) require all Defendant's parenting time to be supervised, as the Court deems appropriate to protect the children;
   4. Order any additional relief necessary to protect the children's safety and best interests, including but not limited to investigative steps, 51A referral if appropriate, counseling or services, and imposition of conditions on parenting time;
   5. Award costs and fees to Plaintiff as permitted by law; and
   6. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
