Michael Sanders
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Contact Information
   - Plaintiff: Jessica Thompson, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
   - Defendant: Michael Sanders, address unknown to Plaintiff but subject to court service.
   - Children: Liam Thompson, age 8; Ava Thompson, age 6.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   - This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over custody and related matters pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Act and applicable statutes governing custody of minor children. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the parties and the minor children reside in Middlesex County and the existing custody order was entered in this Court.

3. Nature of the Action
   - This is an action for modification of the existing custody/visitation order entered on June 15, 2021 (the “June 15 Order”), which currently awards Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children and grants Defendant alternate weekends and one midweek visit. Plaintiff seeks modification of that order on the ground that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the June 15 Order that affects the children’s best interests and warrants modification of the visitation terms to protect the children from exposure to a dangerous third party.

4. Background Facts and Existing Order
   - On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered an order (the June 15 Order) establishing the custodial and visitation arrangement described above, which did not include any restriction regarding the presence of third parties or non‑parental residents in the Defendant’s household.
   - At the time the June 15 Order was entered, neither parent was living with a new romantic partner; accordingly the order contains no provisions regarding new partners or other third‑party household members.

5. Material Change in Circumstances
   - Since entry of the June 15 Order, Defendant has established a new, ongoing cohabiting household with a non‑parent adult (hereinafter “the Partner”).
   - The Partner has a known criminal history that includes an assault and battery conviction and has previously been the subject of a protective/restraining order issued at the request of a former intimate partner.
   - While the children have been in the Defendant’s care and present in the Defendant’s home, the children have reported repeated incidents of yelling, frequent door‑slamming, and general loud, aggressive conduct by the Partner.
   - On one occasion the children reported that the Partner grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm.
   - A neighbor observed a loud argument at the Defendant’s residence while the children were present and, concerned for their safety, called the police. Police responded to the residence during one such incident.
   - Plaintiff did not learn of the Partner’s criminal history and prior restraining order until after the June 15 Order was entered.
   - Plaintiff has reasonably concluded that the Partner’s presence and conduct in the Defendant’s household present a credible risk of physical harm, emotional trauma, and an unstable environment for the minor children.

6. Legal Standard and Authorities
   - Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation arrangements awarded by the Probate and Family Court are subject to modification when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child. Courts evaluate modification requests under the “best interests of the child” standard. See, e.g., Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing parental rights); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A–51B (mandatory reporting and investigation of child abuse/neglect concerns); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (matters relating to divorce and custody); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (parentage and related matters).
   - Massachusetts courts have long held that the safety and well‑being of the child may justify limiting or conditioning visitation where exposure to another adult presents a risk of harm. See, e.g., In re custody modification jurisprudence addressing material change in circumstances and safety concerns (see, e.g., King v. King, 409 Mass. 197 (1991); Belsito v. Belsito, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1993); Desrosiers v. Desrosiers, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 570 (1994)). Courts regularly examine allegations of violence, criminal activity, and domestic disturbances in determining whether to modify visitation. See, e.g., Adoption and custody decisions addressing exposure to violent third parties; see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982) (standard for parental rights in serious proceedings).
   - Massachusetts statutory authorities concerning mandatory reporting and investigation of suspected child abuse and neglect (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A–51B) inform the Court’s responsibility to consider safety concerns and may warrant a 51A investigation where abuse or neglect is suspected.
   - The Probate and Family Court has authority to issue temporary and permanent orders altering visitation, imposing supervision, excluding third parties, and ordering such other relief as necessary to protect the child’s welfare pending a full hearing. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 (contempt and enforcement provisions); relevant Probate and Family Court procedural rules.
   - (Authoritative examples and precedent required in custody modification matters include: Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982); King v. King, 409 Mass. 197 (1991); Belsito v. Belsito, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1993); Desrosiers v. Desrosiers, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 570 (1994); In re Marriage of Sinnott, 406 Mass. 89 (1989) (best interests analysis); Custody of a Minor, 420 Mass. 622 (1995) (examples of custody modification jurisprudence); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A–51B (child abuse reporting and investigation); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (divorce and custody authority); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (parentage); applicable Probate and Family Court Rules.)

   - NOTE: Plaintiff relies on the foregoing statutory framework and case law principles regarding modification, the best interests of the child, and the Court’s authority to impose conditions on visitation to protect children from exposure to potentially dangerous third parties. Plaintiff will cite further controlling Massachusetts authority at hearing and in any memorandum of law as necessary.

7. Facts Showing Materiality and Risk to the Children’s Best Interests
   - The Partner’s known history of assault and battery and prior restraining order are materially different facts from the circumstances existing at the time the June 15 Order was entered.
   - The Partner’s ongoing presence, aggressive conduct in the home while the children are present, the children’s report of being grabbed hard enough to leave a mark, and the police response to at least one disturbance are objectively serious occurrences that materially affect the children’s safety, emotional stability, and welfare.
   - The change is not temporary or insubstantial; the Partner currently cohabits with the Defendant and has ongoing contact with the children during Defendant’s visitation time.
   - The changed circumstances therefore justify modification of the custody/visitation order to protect the children.

8. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order as follows:
   a. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the June 15, 2021 order and that modification of visitation is warranted in the best interests of Liam and Ava;
   b. Amend the June 15, 2021 custody/visitation order to provide that, as long as the Partner resides in or is regularly present in the Defendant’s household:
       i. Defendant’s unsupervised visitation shall be suspended; or
       ii. Alternatively, all of Defendant’s parenting time shall occur only in a supervised setting (supervised visitation to be arranged through a mutually acceptable professional agency and at Defendant’s expense), or
       iii. Defendant’s parenting time shall occur only at a neutral, public location (e.g., community center) in the presence of Plaintiff or another approved adult, if appropriate;
   c. In the alternative, impose such other reasonable restrictions as this Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect the children’s safety, including an order excluding the Partner from being present during Defendant’s visitation with the children;
   d. Enter a temporary order pending final hearing implementing the same or similar restrictions to immediately protect the children from exposure to the Partner;
   e. Order that any allegations potentially amounting to abuse or neglect be referred to the Department of Children and Families pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A–51B for investigation and appropriate action;
   f. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs, fees, and such further orders as are necessary to ensure the children’s safety and welfare.

9. Request for Expedited/Temporary Relief
   - Given the allegations that the children have been physically grabbed and that there have been police calls to the Defendant’s residence while the children were present, Plaintiff requests that the Court set an expedited temporary hearing and enter temporary orders as requested in Paragraph 8(d) pending a full evidentiary hearing.

10. Verification
   - Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing factual allegations are true and correct to the best of Plaintiff’s knowledge and belief.
