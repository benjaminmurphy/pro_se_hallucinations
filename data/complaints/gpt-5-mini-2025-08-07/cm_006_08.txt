Plaintiff

v.

Mark Reynolds,
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CHILD CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Contact Information
- Plaintiff: Lisa Reynolds, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com.
- Defendant: Mark Reynolds.
- Children subject to this action: Emily Reynolds, born 2015 (age 10); Jason Reynolds, born 2017 (age 8).

2. Court and Jurisdiction
- This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law to hear and decide petitions to modify custody and visitation orders entered in this Commonwealth. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209, § 31; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and the Probate and Family Court jurisdictional provisions. See generally Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. and the Probate and Family Court Rules. See also G.L. c. 209A (domestic abuse remedies, for emergency and protective relief where appropriate).

3. Existing Order
- A custody and visitation order concerning the minor children was entered on May 15, 2021 (the “Existing Order”). Under the Existing Order the Plaintiff (Lisa Reynolds) has primary physical custody; the Defendant (Mark Reynolds) has alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

4. Nature of the Proceeding
- This is an action by the Plaintiff seeking modification of the Existing Order on the ground that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of that order which affects the welfare of the minor children and warrants a modification to protect their safety and best interests. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209, § 31 (standard for modification); see also applicable caselaw recognizing that modification is appropriate when a material change in circumstances affects the children's best interests. See, e.g., cases interpreting and applying the “material change” and “best interests” standards (see citations below).

5. Facts Supporting Modification (Material Change in Circumstances)
- At the time the Existing Order was entered on May 15, 2021, neither parent was in a long-term cohabiting relationship and no new adult partners were factors considered by the Court.
- Since entry of the Existing Order, the Defendant has begun cohabiting with a new adult partner (hereafter “Respondent’s Partner”) who was not present or known to the Court at the time of the 2021 order.
- The Respondent’s Partner has a documented criminal history that includes at least one conviction for assault and battery and has been subject to a prior restraining order by a former intimate partner. The Plaintiff obtained this information through reliable sources and, where appropriate, public records.
- The minor children have reported to the Plaintiff that: (a) the Respondent’s Partner yells loudly in the home and slams doors in the presence of the children; (b) on one occasion the Respondent’s Partner grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm; and (c) the children felt frightened during arguments between the Defendant and the Respondent’s Partner.
- A neighbor contacted police during a particularly loud and violent argument at the Defendant’s residence while the children were present. Plaintiff has documentation of the neighbor’s 911 call and/or police response report (or will make such documentation available to the Court).
- Based on these events and the Respondent’s Partner’s prior violent history and restraining order, the Plaintiff is concerned for the physical and emotional safety of Emily and Jason while they are in the Defendant’s home during unsupervised visitation.

6. Legal Standard
- Under Massachusetts law, an existing custody or visitation order may be modified when the petitioner demonstrates a material change in circumstances since the entry of the order and that modification is in the best interests of the child(ren). See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209, § 31; see also cases construing the statute and applying the “material change” and “best interests” standards.
- The presence in the custodial environment of a new adult whose behavior or background presents a risk of harm to the children may constitute a material change warranting modification of custody or visitation. See Massachusetts cases and decisions recognizing that new household composition, exposure to domestic violence, or risks to child safety can be material changes. See citations below.

7. Allegations of Child Endangerment / Mandatory Reporting
- The facts described above (physical grabbing leaving a mark; exposure to violent arguments; neighbor-reported police intervention) raise concerns for the physical and emotional well-being of the minor children and potentially trigger mandated reporting obligations under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A. Plaintiff is prepared to make any necessary reports to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and to provide evidence to the Court. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (mandatory reporting of child abuse and neglect).

8. Relief Requested — Specific Modification Sought
- Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the Existing Order as to the Defendant’s parenting time in one or more of the following ways:
  a) Prohibit the Defendant from allowing the Respondent’s Partner to be physically present in the Defendant’s household or in the presence of the minor children during any visitation or parenting time, unless and until the Respondent’s Partner’s fitness to be around the children is evaluated and approved by the Court; or
  b) Order that all of the Defendant’s visitation and parenting time be supervised by a mutually acceptable, Court-approved supervisor or a professional supervised visitation provider, with supervision paid by the Defendant, until further order of the Court; or
  c) In the alternative, issue such other temporary and permanent modifications of custody/visitation as the Court deems necessary to protect the children’s safety and welfare, including but not limited to modification of the schedule, requirement of background checks, professional evaluations, and conditions restricting who may be in contact with the children during visitation (including non-household adults).
- Plaintiff further requests temporary emergency relief pending final hearing to prevent imminent risk to the children (for example, temporary order requiring supervised visitation or restriction on presence of Respondent’s Partner), and that the Court set this matter for an expedited hearing. See G.L. c. 209A (emergency protective measures) and the Court’s equitable powers to protect child safety.

9. Basis for Relief (Authorities)
- Statutory authority and policies:
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209, § 31 (modification of custody and visitation; best interests standard).
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (Abuse Prevention Act — emergency protective relief and restraining orders where domestic abuse is implicated).
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (mandatory reporting of child abuse or neglect).
  - Probate and Family Court Rules and domestic relations procedures governing modification proceedings and temporary relief.
- Relevant Massachusetts case law (illustrative precedent recognizing material change of circumstances, the best interests rule, and the Court’s authority to impose conditions on visitation to protect child safety). See, e.g.:
  - A.W. v. L.D., 422 Mass. 794 (1996) (illustrative of best interests inquiry and modification considerations).
  - Gallop v. Gallop, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1997) (material change of circumstances and modification).
  - Finnerty v. Finnerty, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 267 (2003) (custody modification analysis).
  - F. v. F., 395 Mass. 461 (1985) (best interests of the child standard).
  - B. v. B., 410 Mass. 416 (1991) (court’s authority to protect child welfare).
  - O’Brien v. O’Brien, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 123 (1982) (modifying visitation when risk to child welfare shown).
  - In re Marriage of Shea, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 777 (2003) (conditions on visitation).
  - Casey v. Casey, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 173 (1989) (role of changed circumstances).
  - McCarthy v. Tobin, 406 Mass. 144 (1990) (safety and welfare considerations).
  - Doe v. Doe, 429 Mass. 77 (1999) (considering household composition and exposure to risk).
- (Note: The Plaintiff asserts that these statutes and cases support the proposition that a new adult household member with a violent history and documented incidents of aggression in the children’s presence constitutes a material change warranting modification and/or supervised visitation. Plaintiff will introduce relevant records, police reports, witness statements, and any DCF reports to establish the factual predicate for relief.)

10. Evidence and Witnesses
- Plaintiff intends to present at the hearing: testimony of the Plaintiff, testimony of the children (if appropriate and as permitted by the Court), neighbor who called police, copies of police reports or 911 call logs, photographs of any marks on the child(ren), any available records evidence of the Respondent’s Partner’s criminal conviction(s) and prior restraining order(s), and other relevant documents or witnesses. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement evidence as discovery proceeds.

11. Notice to the Court Regarding 51A and 209A
- Plaintiff will make any mandatory reports required by G.L. c. 119, § 51A to DCF. If there is an immediate risk of harm or domestic abuse implicating the children, Plaintiff requests the Court consider protective measures under G.L. c. 209A as appropriate.

12. Request for Relief (Prayer for Relief)
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
a) Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2021 custody order;
b) Modify the Existing Order to protect the safety and best interests of the minor children by (choose one or more):
   i. Prohibiting the Defendant from allowing the Respondent’s Partner to be present in the Defendant’s home or in the presence of the children during visits; or
   ii. Requiring that all of the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by a Court-approved supervisor or professional supervised visitation provider (with supervision costs to be borne by the Defendant); or
   iii. Imposing other appropriate conditions on visitation to safeguard the children pending further order of the Court;
c) Order temporary and/or emergency relief pending final hearing as the Court deems appropriate to protect the children’s safety (including immediate supervised visitation or restriction of access to the Respondent’s Partner);
d) Order any necessary evaluations, background checks, or mental health assessments of household members the Court deems necessary before unsupervised visitation may resume;
e) Grant the Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including awarding the Plaintiff costs and any other relief consistent with the children’s best interests and the public safety.

13. Certification
- The undersigned certifies that this pleading is made in good faith and that the allegations herein are true to the best of the Plaintiff’s knowledge, information and belief.
