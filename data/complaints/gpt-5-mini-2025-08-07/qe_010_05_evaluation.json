It states that the covenant protects the tenant\u2019s \u2018beneficial enjoyment\u2019 and that uninhabitable conditions which materially impair basic living requirements justify withholding rent and are directly relevant to possession, thus encompassing peaceful and lawful possession without substantial interference from the landlord or uninhabitable conditions.",

This implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that \u2018bare living requirements\u2019 must be maintained. In most cases substantial compliance with those applicable building and housing code standards which materially affect health and safety will suffice\u2026.\u201d}"
