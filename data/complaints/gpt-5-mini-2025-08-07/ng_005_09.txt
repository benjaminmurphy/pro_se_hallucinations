COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
HAMPDEN COUNTY
Suffolk Superior Court (Hampden Division)

JESSICA MARTIN,
    Plaintiff,

v.                                                Civil Action No.: ___________

ROBERT THOMPSON,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Robert Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martin is an individual resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Her address for service is c/o the undersigned as set forth below.

2. Defendant Robert Thompson is an individual who resides in Springfield, Massachusetts and who at all times relevant herein owned, controlled, possessed and/or maintained the ladder described below at or adjacent to 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

3. The events complained of occurred at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts on March 15, 2023. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction and venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court under the Massachusetts venue statutes and rules because the claims arose in this county and the defendant resides here. Mass. R. Civ. P. 10(a); Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who share a driveway at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

5. Defendant kept a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against the common wooden fence adjacent to the area where Plaintiff parked her car.

6. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant that the ladder might fall onto her vehicle, especially in windy conditions. Defendant stated he would tie the ladder down or move it but failed to do so.

7. On or about March 15, 2023, while backing into the shared driveway at 34 Maple Street, a gust of wind caused Defendant’s unsecured ladder to fall from where it leaned against the fence and strike Plaintiff’s motor vehicle. The ladder struck and dented the hood and cracked the windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle.

8. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained property damage requiring bodywork and replacement of the windshield. Plaintiff’s vehicle remained operable, but Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket costs, including an insurance deductible and the expense of renting a replacement vehicle while repairs were made for over one week.

9. Plaintiff has no significant medical expenses or lost wages arising from this incident.

10. All acts and omissions by the Defendant described herein were negligent and were a proximate cause of the damages incurred by Plaintiff.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Negligence — Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages)

11. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

12. At all times material, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage, securing, and maintenance of his property (including the ladder), so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to neighbors’ persons or property. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282–284 (duty to exercise reasonable care); Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (establishing the common-law negligence standard).

13. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things, negligently leaving a tall extension ladder unsecured and leaning against a shared fence in an area accessible to wind gusts; failing to tie down, move, or otherwise secure the ladder despite prior warnings and requests by Plaintiff; and otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 324A (liability for negligent performance of an undertaking to render services safely); see also Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (duty to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that cause foreseeable harm to others).

14. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of the ladder falling and striking Plaintiff’s vehicle on or about March 15, 2023, thereby causing the property damage alleged herein. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate causation concept); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 431–435 (causation).

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained property damage to her vehicle, incurred out-of-pocket expenses (including insurance deductible and car rental expenses), and has suffered inconvenience, loss of use of her property, and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial. See general negligence damages principles, e.g., Prosser, Law of Torts; see also Massachusetts cases applying negligence standards and awarding compensatory damages (see e.g., Brown v. Kendall, supra; other authorities cited below).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

B. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;

C. Award costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent allowed by law;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
