The Court also frames the constitutional problem in terms of how that fundamental parental autonomy must be respected and weighed when the State, invoking the child\u2019s best interests, authorizes third\u2011party visitation. Thus the case is properly cited for both the recognition of fundamental parental rights and the need to balance those rights against best\u2011interests determinations.",

Thus, Palmore both engages the best\u2011interests framework and delineates which considerations (racial prejudice and its effects) cannot lawfully factor into that analysis, matching the proposition\u2019s description.",

We have little difficulty concluding that they are not\u2026 Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\u201d"
