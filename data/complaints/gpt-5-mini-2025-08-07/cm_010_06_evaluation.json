The Court holds that Washington\u2019s broad third\u2011party visitation statute, as applied, unconstitutionally infringed that parental right by allowing judges to substitute their best\u2011interest judgments for those of a fit parent without giving special weight to the parent\u2019s decision. This directly supports the proposition about Supreme Court precedent on parental rights and the role of courts in custody/visitation matters.",
