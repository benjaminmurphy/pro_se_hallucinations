COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff: Samantha Carter ("Plaintiff"), whose contact information for service and correspondence is:
     Phone: (617) 555-0123
     Email: psm1443@gmail.com

1.2 Defendant: David Carter ("Defendant").

1.3 Minor Child: The custody order sought to be modified concerns the parties’ child, Emily Carter, born in 2015 (age 10).

1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court is the proper venue and has continuing jurisdiction to hear this matter as the Probate and Family Court which entered the original custody order and exercises jurisdiction over custody and parenting time in the Commonwealth.

2. Prior Order
2.1 On May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody/parenting-time order awarding primary residence of the minor child Emily Carter to Defendant, with Plaintiff having limited weekend time and one weeknight dinner per week.

3. Statement of Facts and Change in Circumstances
3.1 At the time the 2018 order was entered, Plaintiff was enrolled in graduate school, residing in a small studio apartment, and had significant schedule constraints. Those circumstances were material to the Court’s allocation of residential custody and parenting time.

3.2 Since entry of the May 15, 2018 order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child:
     a. Plaintiff has completed graduate school.
     b. Plaintiff is employed in a stable full-time position with regular, predictable daytime hours and has a schedule that allows for parenting responsibilities after school and evenings.
     c. Plaintiff now resides in a two-bedroom apartment in which the minor child has her own bedroom and an appropriate home environment for overnights and increased residential time.
     d. The parties’ child, Emily (now age 10), has developed a close, bonded relationship with Plaintiff. During visits, Emily has expressed distress and guilt about leaving Plaintiff’s home after brief visits. Emily’s therapist has documented that Emily feels guilty when visits end and has recommended more frequent and/or longer parenting time with Plaintiff to address emotional needs and stability.
     e. Emily has personally written a letter to the Court expressing a desire for more overnight time with Plaintiff.
     f. Defendant has refused to discuss or negotiate an updated parenting schedule and reacts angrily when Emily brings up the subject of spending more time with Plaintiff, thereby preventing an informal resolution and contributing to emotional stress for the child.

3.3 The foregoing constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order that affects the child’s present and future welfare and justifies modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order to serve the child’s best interests.

4. Legal Basis for Relief
4.1 Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody/parenting-time order pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody matters and the statutory and judicially-developed standard in Massachusetts that custody and parenting-time orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s best interests.

4.2 In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff relies upon applicable Massachusetts statutes and controlling legal principles recognizing that a prior custody allocation based on parental circumstances may be changed where those circumstances have substantially changed and a different arrangement would better serve the child’s best interests.

5. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:

5.1 Find that since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the prior order.

5.2 Modify the May 15, 2018 custody/parenting-time order to reflect a parenting-time plan and custodial arrangement that provides for increased residential time with Plaintiff, including additional overnights and a schedule appropriate for a ten-year-old child, taking into account Emily’s school schedule, extracurricular activities, emotional needs (as reflected in therapist recommendations), and the child’s stated preference.

    (Alternative or in the furtherance of the child’s best interests, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order awarding primary physical residence of Emily to Plaintiff, or, in the alternative, shared physical custody with a substantially increased amount of parenting time for Plaintiff, along with a specific, detailed parenting-time schedule to effectuate the increased time.)

5.3 Order that the parties participate, if the Court deems appropriate, in parenting coordination or mediation to develop a detailed parenting calendar and to facilitate co-parenting communication in the child’s best interests.

5.4 Order such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests, health, and welfare of the minor child, including but not limited to the costs of filing and reasonable counsel and professional fees if the Court deems appropriate.

6. Attachments and Evidence
6.1 Plaintiff will submit (or has attached) the following in support of this Complaint:
     a. A certified or conformed copy of the May 15, 2018 custody/parenting-time order.
     b. A written statement from the child’s therapist documenting the child’s emotional state and the recommendation for increased time with Plaintiff.
     c. The child’s written letter to the Court expressing her preferences regarding parenting time.
     d. Proof of Plaintiff’s current residence (formal lease or other documentation) and factual declaration regarding employment status and schedule.
     e. Any other documents the Court may require to establish the change in circumstances and the best interests of the child.

7. Verification
I, Samantha Carter, declare under the penalties of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

Plaintiff, Pro Se

NOTICE TO DEFENDANT: You must respond to this Complaint in writing within the time allowed by the Probate and Family Court Rules. If you fail to respond, the Court may enter the relief requested by Plaintiff without further notice to you.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Selected)
Note: The following list is provided to identify the principal Massachusetts statutory framework and legal principles under which modification of custody and parenting-time orders is sought. Plaintiff intends to rely on the statutory and case law governing custody modifications and the “best interests of the child” standard as applied by the Probate and Family Court and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions governing divorce and custody matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Massachusetts enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, UCCJEA) — jurisdictional rules relevant to custody orders.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, relevant provisions concerning child welfare and the role of professionals (where applicable).
- Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Rules and Domestic Relations procedures (Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. and local rules), including rules governing modification proceedings and service.
- Relevant provisions of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure where applicable to procedure in the Probate and Family Court.

Representative Massachusetts Case Law (selection reflecting the governing principles of modification, material change of circumstances, and the “best interests” standard)
- Massachusetts cases interpreting the “best interests of the child” standard and the circumstances under which custody and parenting-time may be modified will be relied upon at hearing; Plaintiff will cite relevant Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court authority regarding:
   - that a prior custody allocation may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior order;
   - that the child’s preferences (when appropriate given age and maturity) and the child’s emotional well-being and therapist recommendations are relevant considerations;
   - that stability of parental housing, parental employment and availability for parenting time, and the quality of the parent-child relationship are material to a modification analysis.

Plaintiff will present and rely on applicable Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court opinions at hearing addressing these principles (statements of principles appear, for example, in Massachusetts appellate decisions construing G.L. c. 208 and applying the best-interests standard to modification requests), as well as any controlling precedent specifically addressing modification where the primary grounds for the original custody allocation (such as parental schooling, housing, or employment constraints) have changed.

(At hearing, Plaintiff will provide full citations to the controlling Massachusetts statutes, rules, and cases cited above and relied upon. Because Plaintiff is proceeding pro se at this time, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court consider the facts pleaded hereunder and the attachments in determining whether the statutory standard for modification is met and to determine the parenting-time and custody arrangement that best serves the child’s interests.)

Certificate of Service
I hereby certify that on this day I will (or have) served a copy of this Complaint for Modification of Custody Order on the Defendant in accordance with the Probate and Family Court Rules.

Date: December 1, 2025
