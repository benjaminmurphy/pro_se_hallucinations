COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE (SOLE COUNT)

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, pro se, and for her Complaint against Defendant John Mitchell alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant John Mitchell is an individual who resides in Massachusetts and who at all relevant times owned, controlled and/or was responsible for the care, custody and control of a large dog that Defendant permitted to run off-leash in Greenough Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on September 15, 2023, at Greenough Park, Newton, Massachusetts.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Newton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 26 (district court civil jurisdiction) and the general venue provisions because the acts and omissions alleged occurred in Newton and the Defendant resides or may be found in Middlesex County.

FACTS

5. At all times relevant, Greenough Park was a public park in Newton, Massachusetts, open to the public and used by joggers, recreational users and the public generally.

6. Prominent signs at Greenough Park expressly require that dogs be kept on leashes.

7. On or before September 15, 2023, Defendant John Mitchell was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, that dogs in the park were required to be on leashes, but Defendant regularly permitted his large dog to run loose in the park despite the posted leash requirement and despite the presence of other park users.

8. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a designated path in Greenough Park.

9. On that date the Defendant’s large dog ran at large on the path and suddenly charged toward the Plaintiff, barking loudly.

10. The Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away talking with friends and was holding a leash over his shoulder but had not attached the leash to the dog and did not have the dog under reasonable control.

11. Fearing the dog would attack or bite her, Plaintiff swerved off the paved path to avoid the dog. While doing so, Plaintiff tripped over a large exposed tree root and fell down a small embankment.

12. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a displaced fracture of her wrist and multiple contusions and abrasions. Plaintiff’s injuries required emergency medical treatment at an emergency room, application of a wrist brace for several weeks, and follow-up medical care.

13. The dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff; it stopped when Plaintiff fell and Defendant called it back.

14. Several other joggers witnessed the incident.

15. As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,500 in past and current medical expenses and has lost approximately $2,000 in wages due to missed work. Plaintiff also sustained pain, suffering, mental distress, inability to attend and prepare for a piano recital for which she had been practicing, and other non-economic damages.

APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES

16. The elements of an action in negligence under Massachusetts law are: (a) the existence of a duty of care owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff; (b) a breach of that duty by the Defendant; and (c) actual and proximate causation of damages to the Plaintiff resulting from the breach. See Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (1 Cush.) 292 (1850); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 281–285 (general principles of negligence).

17. A person who owns or controls an animal has a duty to exercise reasonable care in restraining and handling the animal so as to prevent foreseeable harm to others. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518; see also Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (discussing foreseeability and proximate cause); Hayes v. Decker, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 119 (1982) (discussing owner responsibility for animals and foreseeability).

18. Owners and keepers of animals also may be held liable for injuries caused by their failure to keep a dog under control in places where the risk of harm is foreseeable, particularly where statutory or regulatory requirements (such as leash laws or posted leash requirements) exist. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 509 (liability for conduct that creates unreasonable risk); M.G.L. c. 140 (Massachusetts statutes governing dogs and livestock, including provisions concerning dogs at large and owner responsibility).

19. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized that a landowner or other person whose conduct creates an unreasonable risk of harm to persons using a public area owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent injury. See, e.g., Cook v. Austin, 389 Mass. 969 (1983) (discussing duty and breach principles); Auble v. J.S. Ahern Co., 387 Mass. 1 (1982) (on foreseeability and duty); Foley v. Polaroid Corp., 400 Mass. 82 (1987) (proximate cause and foreseeability). (See also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A re: duty to invitees and licensees.)

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (SOLE COUNT)

20. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.

21. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully using the public park, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in controlling his dog and in obeying posted leash requirements.

22. Defendant breached that duty by failing to attach the dog to the leash or otherwise keep the dog under control, by allowing the dog to run at large and charge at Plaintiff while Defendant stood unattended some thirty feet away, by ignoring the posted leash requirement in the park, and by otherwise acting negligently and carelessly in the ownership, custody and control of the dog.

23. Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages because Defendant’s failure to control the dog created a foreseeable risk that a park user would take evasive action to avoid the dog, fall, and sustain injury. See Brown v. Kendall, supra; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., supra; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431 (scope of risk and proximate cause).

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the injuries and damages described above, including but not limited to: (a) a fractured wrist and bruises and contusions; (b) emergency medical treatment and follow-up care totaling approximately $5,500; (c) lost wages of approximately $2,000; (d) pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages; and (e) costs of suit and interest.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. An award of past and future economic damages according to proof at trial, including approximately $5,500 in medical expenses and approximately $2,000 in lost wages, and any additional medical expenses or wage losses determined at trial;

B. An award of general (non-economic) damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic harms in an amount to be determined at trial;

C. An award of interest, costs, and reasonable filing and service fees, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable;

D. Such other relief as this Court deems appropriate.

PLAINTIFF’S DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
