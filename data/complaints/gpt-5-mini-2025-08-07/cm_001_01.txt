Mark Thompson
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Laura Johnson ("Plaintiff" or "Laura") is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant" or "Mark") is the children’s father and a party to the existing custody/parenting order entered in this Court.
1.3 The minor children subject to this action are Emma Johnson, born 2017 (age 8), and Liam Johnson, born 2019 (age 6) (collectively, the "Children").
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter and the parties pursuant to Massachusetts law because the prior custody/parenting time order was entered in the Probate and Family Court for Bristol County on March 15, 2021, and the parties and the Children are residents of Massachusetts.

2. Existing Order
2.1 On or about March 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody/parenting time order (the "Existing Order") which established that Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the Children and that Defendant has parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week (the "Parenting Schedule").

3. Nature of Relief Sought
3.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28 and related authority, seeking modification of the Existing Order to change the Parenting Schedule and to impose reasonable limitations and procedures for overnight parenting time to protect the Children’s safety, stability, and best interests.
3.2 Plaintiff alleges a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that justifies modification of the Parenting Schedule. Plaintiff requests temporary relief as needed, a hearing on the merits, and entry of an amended parenting plan consistent with the relief requested below.

4. Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 At the time the Existing Order was negotiated and entered (March 15, 2021), both parents worked regular daytime schedules and the Parenting Schedule was workable and in the Children’s best interests.
4.2 Since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant has accepted a new work schedule that regularly requires him to work overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Several nights per week he works these overnight shifts, including nights that correspond to his scheduled overnight parenting time under the Existing Order.
4.3 As a result of the new work schedule, Defendant has repeatedly failed to be available and alert to care for the Children during his scheduled overnights. On numerous occasions he has dropped the Children off at Plaintiff’s residence with little or no notice to Plaintiff and with no reasonable plan for safe, attentive care. Defendant has told Plaintiff that he is "too tired" after work to care for the Children, and he has left the Children in the care of his roommate — a person unknown or unknown well to Plaintiff — during times when Defendant is awake only to nap or rests immediately after his shift.
4.4 The Children have reported to Plaintiff that they often fall asleep on the couch while Defendant naps after returning home from work and that Defendant is frequently too sleepy to engage with them or attend to their needs during his scheduled overnights.
4.5 On multiple occasions Defendant’s last-minute drop-offs have disrupted the Children’s routines, caused confusion and stress, and required Plaintiff to rearrange work and childcare at short notice. These occurrences have been recurring and substantial in number and frequency since the change in Defendant’s work schedule.
4.6 Defendant’s overnight unavailability, last-minute drop-offs, and reliance on third-party caregivers about whom Plaintiff has little or no information constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order and create concerns about the Children’s safety, stability, and welfare when Defendant is scheduled for overnight parenting time while working overnight shifts.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Under Massachusetts law, modification of a custody or parenting order requires a showing of a material change in circumstances and that modification of the existing order is in the best interests of the child. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28; see also governing case law and authorities cited below.
5.2 The best-interests standard includes consideration of the child’s safety, the stability of the child’s living situation, the child’s health and emotional needs, parental availability, and the reasonableness of the proposed parenting schedule. The Court has authority to modify parenting time and impose reasonable conditions to protect the child’s welfare and to ensure parenting time occurs when a parent is able to provide appropriate care and supervision.

6. Basis for Relief Requested
6.1 The changes in Defendant’s employment hours and the resulting parenting-time problems (frequent last-minute drop-offs, Defendant’s fatigue and lack of alertness while caring for the Children, and the Children being left with an unfamiliar roommate) are substantial, unanticipated, and ongoing. These events are a material change of circumstances that warrant modification of the Existing Order.
6.2 Continued enforcement of the Existing Order without modification would subject the Children to continued risk of inadequate supervision, inconsistent routines, disruption, and emotional stress. Modification limiting overnight parenting time to periods when Defendant is not scheduled to work and requiring reasonable notice and caregiver disclosures is in the Children’s best interests.

7. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order granting the following relief:
7.1 That the Existing Order be modified to require that Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur only when Defendant is scheduled to be off work and reasonably available to personally supervise and care for the Children for the duration of the overnight period. Overnights shall not occur when Defendant is scheduled to work a night shift ending near or during the overnight period.
7.2 That, when Defendant’s work schedule makes overnights impossible or impracticable, the parties’ parenting time schedule will convert the overnight period to daytime parenting time on a schedule to be set by the Court (e.g., extended daytime visits), or that weekend/daytime parenting time be adjusted so that Defendant receives comparable time when he is off duty.
7.3 That Defendant be required to provide to Plaintiff, at least seven (7) days in advance when practicable, his work schedule covering the upcoming month (or as otherwise ordered by the Court) so that parenting time may be scheduled and so Plaintiff may plan for the Children’s safety and childcare.
7.4 That Defendant be required to provide the names, addresses, and contact information for any person who will be supervising or caring for the Children in his home or while they are in his care (including roommates or other regular caregivers) and that such persons be subject to emergency contact and identification requirements.
7.5 That Defendant provide reasonable notice (not less than 24 hours when practicable) before any deviation from the parenting schedule, and that unplanned last-minute drop-offs without prior notice be prohibited except in bona fide emergencies; that the Court retain jurisdiction to determine whether any purported “emergencies” are valid.
7.6 That the Court order any other relief necessary to protect the Children’s safety and best interests, including but not limited to temporary modification of parenting time pending hearing, appointment of a guardian ad litem or child psychiatrist/psychologist if the Court deems appropriate, and requirements for transportation and exchanges to minimize disruption.
7.7 That the Court award Plaintiff costs and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including attorney’s fees if warranted (or such relief as the Court finds appropriate given the parties’ relative resources).
7.8 That the Court schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and enter temporary relief if the Court finds it necessary to protect the Children pending final determination.

8. Certificate of Good Faith
8.1 Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to resolve this matter informally with Defendant prior to filing this Complaint by discussing scheduling concerns and requesting that overnight parenting time not be exercised when Defendant is unable to provide adequate care due to his work schedule. Despite Plaintiff’s attempts, Defendant has continued to exercise overnight parenting time without regard to his work fatigue and has continued last-minute drop-offs, necessitating this application to the Court.

9. Prayer for Relief
9.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court:
     a) Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order and that modification is warranted;
     b) Modify the Existing Order as set forth in Paragraphs 7.1–7.7 above (or in the alternative, in such other manner as the Court deems in the Children’s best interests);
     c) Schedule an expedited hearing and enter temporary orders as necessary pending final hearing; and
     d) Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Laura Johnson
