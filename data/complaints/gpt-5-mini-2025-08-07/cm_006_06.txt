COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
a. Petitioner: Emma Richardson, of Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Petitioner’s contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
b. Respondent: Jacob Thompson, of Barnstable County, Massachusetts.
c. The subject minor children are:
   - Ava Richardson, born 2015 (age 10);
   - Lucas Richardson, born 2017 (age 8).
d. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law because the original custody order was entered in this Court and the children reside in Massachusetts. The original custody/visitation order relevant to this Complaint was entered on June 15, 2021.

2. Relief Requested
Petitioner seeks a modification of the existing custody/visitation order dated June 15, 2021, to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the minor children. Specifically, Petitioner requests that the Court:
a. Prohibit Respondent from having the specified third party (the person with a criminal history and prior restraining order) physically present in the same household or at any parenting-time contact with the minor children; OR
b. In the alternative, order that all of Respondent’s parenting time be supervised by an approved professional or agency until further order of the Court; and
c. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to ordering a guardian ad litem, a forensic custody evaluation, and/or referral to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) for investigation, if appropriate.

3. Background — Existing Order
a. On June 15, 2021, this Court entered an order awarding primary physical custody of the minor children to Petitioner and awarding Respondent alternate weekends and one midweek visit per week (the “Existing Order”).
b. At the time the Existing Order was entered, neither party was living with a new romantic partner and there was no finding or provision in the decree regarding new partners being present during parenting time.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
Since entry of the Existing Order, a material change in circumstances has occurred that directly affects the safety and welfare of the minor children and warrants modification of custody/visitation under Massachusetts law:
a. Respondent has begun cohabiting with a new partner (hereafter the “Cohabitant”), who has a documented criminal history for assault and battery and who has been the subject of a prior restraining order entered by a former intimate partner.
b. The minor children have reported to Petitioner that the Cohabitant yells frequently in the home, slams doors, and has engaged in physical conduct toward at least one of the children that left a visible mark on the child’s arm.
c. A neighbor called the police during a loud argument at Respondent’s residence while the minor children were present. Police responded to the disturbance.
d. These new facts were not known to the Court and did not exist at the time of the Existing Order, and they raise serious concerns about the children’s emotional and physical safety when in Respondent’s care or present in Respondent’s home.
e. Petitioner has reasonable concern, based on the foregoing, that remaining in the status quo would place the children at risk of harm and is not consistent with their best interests.

5. Best Interests of the Children
a. Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation determinations must be made in accordance with the best interests of the child. The presence in Respondent’s household of an individual with a history of violent criminal conduct and a prior restraining order — together with the children’s reports of verbal aggression, door-slamming, and at least one incident of physical grabbing that left a mark — constitute a substantial risk to the children’s welfare and material changed circumstances warranting modification.
b. Petitioner requests that the Court modify the Existing Order to eliminate or limit the children’s exposure to the Cohabitant by prohibiting the Cohabitant from being present during parenting-time exchanges and visits, or by requiring supervision of Respondent’s parenting time until the Court determines that unsupervised parenting time will not jeopardize the children’s safety or well-being.

6. Requested Interim Relief
Given the immediate safety concerns described above, Petitioner requests that the Court issue temporary/interim relief pending a full hearing on this Complaint, including but not limited to a temporary order that:
a. Prohibits the Cohabitant from being present in the home or during any in-person contact between Respondent and the children; or
b. Requires that all of Respondent’s parenting time be supervised by a professional or agency-approved supervisor; and
c. Orders that any in-person contact occur only after an approved safety plan is in place; and
d. Orders that the names and identifying information for the Cohabitant be disclosed to the Court and to any evaluating professional for purposes of background checks and safety assessment.

7. Additional Relief and Investigations
Petitioner respectfully requests the Court also consider the following as appropriate:
a. Appointment of a guardian ad litem for the minor children or a court-appointed evaluator to investigate and make a recommendation to the Court regarding custody and visitation;
b. A referral to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) for investigation pursuant to M.G.L. c. 119, § 51A, if the Court determines a report is appropriate;
c. An order for Respondent to refrain from introducing any new cohabitants to the children without prior written notice to Petitioner and the Court and, if requested by Petitioner or the Court, prior court approval; and
d. Any other remedy the Court deems necessary to protect the children’s health, safety, and welfare.

8. Factual Support / Attachment of Evidence
To support this Complaint, Petitioner will rely on:
a. The minor children’s statements to Petitioner regarding the Cohabitant’s behavior;
b. A contemporaneous photograph/observation of the mark on the child’s arm (if available) and any contemporaneous notes made by Petitioner;
c. Any police reports generated from the neighbor’s 911 call and subsequent police response to the Respondent’s residence;
d. Any public records showing the Cohabitant’s prior criminal conviction(s) and the existence of a prior restraining order; and
e. Testimony and documentary evidence establishing the foregoing facts.

9. Legal Basis for Modification
This Complaint is brought pursuant to the appropriate provisions of Massachusetts law governing modification of custody and visitation orders where a material change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the child. Petitioner relies on statutory and case law principles that custody and visitation may be modified when continuing the existing arrangement would be detrimental to the child’s welfare or when new facts affecting the child’s welfare have arisen since entry of the prior order.

(See Authorities listed below.)

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
1. Schedule a hearing on this Complaint at the earliest practicable date;
2. Enter such temporary orders as necessary to protect the minor children’s safety pending final resolution, including prohibiting the Cohabitant from presence during visits or ordering supervised visitation;
3. After hearing, enter a permanent modification of the Existing Order consistent with the children’s best interests, including provision that the Cohabitant may not be present during Respondent’s parenting time unless and until the Court finds that presence is safe, or that all Respondent’s parenting time be supervised, or other appropriate restrictions;
4. Order such evaluations, guardian ad litem appointment, and/or DCF investigation as the Court deems necessary; and
5. Grant such other relief as the Court considers just and equitable.

Petitioner declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of her knowledge.
