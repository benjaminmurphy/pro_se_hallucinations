It ties these obligations both to the implied warranty of habitability and to the expanded covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects a tenant\u2019s \u201cbeneficial enjoyment\u201d through maintenance of basic services. Thus, failure to provide essential services like hot water can constitute a breach of the landlord\u2019s obligations to provide habitable premises and of the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment.",

      "supports_proposition": true,
      "support_confidence": "medium",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion clearly holds that a residential lease includes an implied warranty of habitability covering essential facilities, and that the landlord\u2019s failure to maintain such essential services (including adequate hot water) breaches that obligation. It also ties such failures to tenants\u2019 inability to bathe adequately, showing that lack of hot water is within the contemplated breach of habitability/fitness for residential use. However, the case analyzes these failures under the implied warranty of habitability and contract theory, not explicitly as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, so that portion of the proposition is only implicitly, not expressly, supported.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "[T]he residential tenant who has suffered a breach of the warranty . . . cannot bathe as frequently as he would like or at all if there is inadequate hot water; he must worry about rodents harassing his children or spreading disease if the premises are infested; or he must avoid certain rooms or worry about catching a cold if there is inadequate weather protection or heat. Thus, discomfort and annoyance are the common injuries caused by each breach and hence the true nature of the general damages the tenant is claiming."

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition is very general\u2014stating only that unspecified rights and remedies \"asserted herein\" are supported by listed authorities. Park West squarely holds that New York residential leases contain a nonwaivable implied warranty of habitability, that breach of that warranty allows tenants to withhold rent and obtain an abatement measured by diminution in value, and that this warranty applies even when conditions result from events like strikes. Thus, insofar as the asserted rights and remedies relate to the implied warranty of habitability and rent abatement/setoff in residential leases, this case does support that proposition. Because the exact rights and remedies referenced are not specified in the snippet, the fit is assessed at medium confidence rather than high.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Codifying existing case law, the enactment of section 235-b of the Real Property Law (L 1975, ch 597, as amd), placed \"the tenant in parity legally with the landlord\"... A residential lease is now effectively deemed a sale of shelter and services by the landlord who impliedly warrants: first, that the premises are fit for human habitation... The obligation of the tenant to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord\u2019s satisfactory maintenance of the premises in habitable condition... the proper measure of damages for breach of the warranty is the difference between the fair market value of the premises if they had been as warranted... and the value of the premises during the period of the breach."

Loretto clearly is a leading authority establishing that a permanent, even minor, physical occupation of property authorized by the government is a per se taking requiring just compensation, so it validly serves as supporting authority for takings-based rights or remedies. There is no mismatch or mischaracterization of the holding in this generic use.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe conclude that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve. \u2026 In short, when the \u2018character of the governmental action\u2019 \u2026 is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.\u201d"
