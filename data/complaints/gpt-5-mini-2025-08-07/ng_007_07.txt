COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff James Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff James Thompson is an adult resident and citizen of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center is an entity doing business and providing after-school and recreational programs at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302. At all times relevant herein Defendant was responsible for staffing, supervision, safety policies, and the condition of its premises, including the gymnasium located at 75 Crescent Street.

3. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, §1 (jurisdiction of district courts) and because the events complained of occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts.

4. This Complaint is filed within the period required by Massachusetts law; the statutory period for personal injury actions is three years from the date of the injury. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, §2A.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at approximately the after-school program hours, Plaintiff’s minor child attended an after-school program run by Defendant at its gymnasium located at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, MA 02302.

6. Defendant advertises and represents that children participating in its after-school programs will be supervised at all times while in the gym.

7. On September 15, 2023, the gym was scheduled to be supervised by two staff members while approximately twenty children were present. One of the two staff members left the gym area and went to the office to perform paperwork, leaving only one staff member in the gym on duty.

8. The remaining staff member was largely inattentive—standing near the bleachers and looking at her cellular phone—while children were playing on the hardwood floor.

9. Two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood gym floor. Several children noticed the game and reported it to the staff member on duty. The staff member responded dismissively, saying words to the effect of “boys will be boys” and took no effective steps to stop the dangerous activity or to separate the children.

10. Plaintiff’s eight-year-old child (small for his age) was deliberately tackled by one of the older boys, struck his head on the hardwood floor, and lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

11. Plaintiff’s child was transported to an emergency room and diagnosed with a concussion. He missed several days of school and required medical treatment and follow-up related to the concussion.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,000 in medical expenses, has suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200 (as a result of parental time away from work to care for the injured child), and has sustained pain, suffering, and other compensable damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through 12 above as if fully set forth herein.

14. At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation and supervision of its after-school program and the safety of children in its care, including a duty to provide adequate supervision, to enforce safety rules, to take reasonable steps to prevent known or foreseeable hazards and dangerous activities, and to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §314A (duty of possessor of land to exercise reasonable care to protect others from third-party conduct); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§282, 302B, 324A (establishing basic standards of care and liability for negligent supervision and affirmative acts creating risk).

15. Defendant breached its duties by, among other things:
   a. leaving the gym under-supervised (reducing two assigned staff to one and permitting that single staff member to be inattentive);
   b. permitting or failing to stop a dangerously rough tackle game between older and younger children on a hard hardwood gym floor;
   c. failing to remove or separate children engaged in hazardous conduct after multiple warnings from other children;
   d. failing to provide supervision consistent with its representations and customary standards for after-school programs; and
   e. failing to take reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable injury to smaller, younger children from being harmed by older, larger children in rough play.

16. Defendant’s breaches were negligent and proximately caused the tackle of Plaintiff’s child, the child’s head striking the hardwood floor, loss of consciousness, and the concussion and related injuries and damages described above. See Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (explaining the foundational negligence standard requiring the exercise of reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §314A; §302B.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer economic and non-economic damages, including but not limited to:
   a. medical and related expenses (approximately $5,000 to date);
   b. loss of earnings and wages (approximately $1,200 to date);
   c. pain, suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, impairment, and loss of enjoyment of life; and
   d. costs of suit and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES

18. Plaintiff relies on the general principles of negligence under Massachusetts law, the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and relevant Massachusetts case law interpreting duties of care, duties to supervise, and premises liability. Authorities include, without limitation:
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, §2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions);
   - Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (general rules of pleading);
   - Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (basic negligence standard);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §282 (negligence — lack of due care);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §302B (negligent entrustment and responsibility for third-party conduct);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §314A (duty of possessor to protect against third-party acts);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §324A (liability for negligent performance of affirmative acts);
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts §321 (duty and foreseeability principles);
   - Mass. cases applying the Restatement standards to premises and supervision contexts (see, e.g., cases addressing duty to supervise and to protect invitees and licensees; see also decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and Massachusetts trial courts construing reasonable care and foreseeability);
   - Massachusetts Pattern Jury Instructions — Civil (negligence and duty instructions) and other Massachusetts authorities interpreting the duty to exercise reasonable care in supervision and premises contexts.

(These authorities are cited to establish governing principles of negligence, foreseeability, duty, breach, causation, and damages under Massachusetts law; Plaintiff may rely on additional case law and statutory authority as the litigation develops.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses (approximately $5,000), lost wages (approximately $1,200), and non-economic damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. For interest on all recoverable sums as allowed by law from the date of injury;

C. For costs and expenses of this action, including filing fees and costs of service;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
