Emily Johnson,
    Plaintiff,
v.                                                  Civil Action No. ___________

Robert Williams,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident of Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents the second-floor apartment at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144.

2. Defendant Robert Williams ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the property located at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144 and, at all relevant times, landlord of Plaintiff’s apartment. Defendant may be served at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court because the premises subject to this complaint are located in Somerville and the acts giving rise to this claim occurred in Somerville.

4. Plaintiff brings this action pro se. Plaintiff’s contact information: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1433@gmail.com.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into possession under a residential tenancy at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, MA, for which Plaintiff pays $1,800 per month in rent.

6. Plaintiff’s lease contains an express entitlement to "quiet enjoyment," and, in any event, Plaintiff enjoys an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized by Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

7. Approximately six months ago (spring 2025), tenants who occupy the unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment moved in.

8. Since their move-in, the upstairs tenants have engaged in repeated and ongoing, unreasonable and substantial noise and disruptive conduct (including loud stomping, late-night music, and what sounds like moving furniture at or near midnight) at all hours.

9. Plaintiff has attempted to resolve the problem directly: Plaintiff asked the upstairs tenants to reduce the noise; they complied for approximately one week and then resumed the disruptive conduct.

10. Plaintiff has repeatedly complained to Defendant—approximately five or six times—requesting that Defendant take reasonable steps to abate the nuisance and enforce the lease terms. On at least one occasion, Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants but thereafter informed Plaintiff that he "can't control how people live" and has taken no effective remedial action.

11. Defendant has actual notice of the continuing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and has failed to take reasonable steps to abate the interference.

12. As a result of the ongoing noise, Plaintiff is averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night and has experienced significant adverse impacts on health and employment. Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk. Plaintiff’s physician has prescribed sleep medication, which Plaintiff now pays $40 per month to obtain.

13. Plaintiff has incurred other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in an effort to mitigate the disturbance, including purchasing earplugs and a white noise machine, and attempting to rearrange the bedroom. None of these measures have remedied the substantial interference.

14. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages resulting from the substantial, unreasonable, and ongoing interference with her quiet enjoyment, including physical and emotional distress, diminution of the benefit of the bargain under the lease, and out-of-pocket expenses.

LEGAL BASIS — BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, tenants are entitled to the covenant (express and/or implied) of quiet enjoyment: the right to possession and use of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or others acting with the landlord’s knowledge or consent. The landlord is obligated to take reasonable steps to abate substantial interferences of which the landlord has notice. See M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes); see also common-law principles recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties.

17. The landlord's failure to take reasonable actions to abate known substantial interference that significantly impairs a tenant's use and enjoyment constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment entitling the tenant to damages for loss of use, consequential damages, and other remedies under Massachusetts law.

18. By allowing the above-described substantial and ongoing noise disturbance to continue after receiving repeated complaints and requests for remedial action from Plaintiff, Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease and/or the express covenant promising quiet enjoyment.

19. Defendant’s breach has proximately caused Plaintiff to suffer actual damages including, but not limited to, diminution of the rental value and enjoyment of the premises, medical and prescription expenses ($40/month for sleep medication), reasonable mitigation expenses (earplugs, white noise machine), and lost income or other employment consequences (written warning at work), as well as emotional distress and inconvenience.

20. Plaintiff estimates her recoverable compensatory damages directly attributable to Defendant’s breach to be $2,400. Plaintiff also reserves the right to prove a greater amount at trial and to recover any further damages as established by evidence.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon and cites the following Massachusetts statutes, rules, and authorities relevant to landlord obligations and remedies for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and related landlord-tenant principles (non-exhaustive):

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant generally)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process; jurisdiction and procedure for housing matters)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2 and § 9 (Unfair and deceptive acts or practices; private remedy for certain landlord conduct)
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant (provisions on covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties) (persuasive authority)
- Massachusetts decisions recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord remedial duties (see, e.g., cases discussing landlord responsibility for nuisances, imposition of damages for interference with possession and use, and remedies for breach of quiet enjoyment) (collectively cited as Massachusetts common law and SJC/Appeals Court precedent interpreting landlord-tenant duties)

(Notes: Plaintiff cites the foregoing statutory and common-law authorities for the Court’s consideration; Plaintiff will rely on controlling Massachusetts statutory law and on SJC and Appeals Court precedent recognizing and defining the covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord duties to abate known nuisances, and tenant remedies for breach. Plaintiff intends to rely on relevant and controlling Massachusetts caselaw and authorities at hearing or trial.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and award the following relief against Defendant:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount not less than $2,400, or such other amount as Plaintiff proves at trial for loss of use and enjoyment of the premises, medical/prescription expenses, mitigation expenses (earplugs, white noise machine), and other consequential damages caused by Defendant’s breach;

B. An order declaring that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

C. An order requiring Defendant to take reasonable steps to abate the ongoing noise and to enforce lease provisions against the upstairs tenants (including, if necessary, restraining further nuisance conduct or requiring remedial steps to reduce noise);

D. Costs of suit and filing fees;

E. Pre- and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;

F. Such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
