Dwyer deals exclusively with property law governing easements (dominant and servient estates, and unilateral relocation of easements by the servient owner). It does not concern landlord-tenant relationships, habitability, landlord obligations, or tenants\u2019 remedies. Citing this case as discussing landlord obligations and tenants\u2019 remedies is therefore inaccurate and not supported by the holding or reasoning.",

We conclude that, subject to certain limitations, described below, the servient estate owner may do so.\u2026 The owner of the servient estate is in possession of the estate burdened by the easement. An easement is created to serve a particular objective, not to grant the easement holder the power to veto other uses of the servient estate that do not interfere with that purpose.\u201d"
