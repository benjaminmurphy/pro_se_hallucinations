    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant is the landlord that owns and operates the building and is responsible for maintaining common areas and life\u2011safety devices (\u00b6\u00b62,6,17). Those factual allegations establish a landlord\u2019s duty to tenants to maintain smoke detectors and warn of known dangerous conditions."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the hallway detector repeatedly chirped for months, Plaintiff notified Defendant at least three times, Defendant promised to \u2018take care of it\u2019 but did not, and the detector\u2019s battery was removed and not reinstalled so the detector was inoperative (\u00b6\u00b67\u20139,18). Those facts sufficiently plead a failure to maintain/repair the device."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the detector was inoperative and therefore failed to sound an alarm; Plaintiff\u2019s awareness and escape were delayed by the lack of alarm, and she suffered smoke inhalation and required hospitalization (\u00b6\u00b611\u201313,19). Those allegations, if proved, support the reasonable inference that the injuries would not have occurred but for the defective/nonfunctioning alarm."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint expressly alleges the harm was a reasonably foreseeable result of failing to maintain operative smoke detectors and that Defendant knew or should have known such failure would create an unreasonable risk of serious injury (\u00b6\u00b620,23\u201325). Given the nature of smoke detectors, those factual allegations adequately plead proximate causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete damages including approximately $10,500 in medical expenses, $2,000 in lost wages, hospitalization, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and property damage (\u00b6\u00b613\u201314,21). These allegations adequately plead actual damages."
