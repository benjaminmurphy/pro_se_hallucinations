COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/ PARENTING TIME

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   1.1. Plaintiff: Rebecca Collins, pro se, (tel.) (617) 555-0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant: Tom Collins.
   1.3. The minor child subject to this action is Max Collins, born (age 8).
   1.4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA), and by virtue of the existing custody order entered in this Court on November 15, 2019.
   1.5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the original order was entered in this Court and the child resides in Massachusetts.

2. Nature of Action
   2.1. This is an action by the Plaintiff to modify the current custody/parenting-time order entered on November 15, 2019, which currently awards primary physical custody of the minor child to the Plaintiff and grants the Defendant three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.
   2.2. Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing order to reflect material changes in circumstances since entry of the order and to provide a parenting plan that is in the child’s best interests given the child’s current needs, age, and school schedule.

3. Background and Factual Allegations (Material Change in Circumstances)
   3.1. At the time the current order was entered (11/15/2019) the Defendant did not have suitable housing for overnight parenting time: he occupied a shared apartment with roommates and did not have a separate bedroom for the child. Because of that housing situation the Court limited the Defendant’s parenting time to several short visits and a Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.
   3.2. Since entry of the order, the Defendant has obtained a separate apartment in which the minor child has an identified bedroom suitable for overnight stays. The Defendant’s housing situation has materially improved and now provides an appropriate, stable environment for overnight parenting time.
   3.3. The child is now eight years old and attends school full time. Over the past several years the short, frequent midweek visits (three short visits during the week plus a short Sunday visit) have caused frequent shuttle trips on school nights, disrupting the child’s homework, bedtime routine, and rest. This arrangement is no longer practicable or in the child’s best interests.
   3.4. The child has repeatedly asked to have actual sleepovers at his father’s home.
   3.5. The Plaintiff and Defendant are in agreement that the parenting plan should be changed to reduce disruptive short school-night exchanges and to provide parenting time consistent with the child’s age, school obligations, and need for stable routine, and to permit reasonable overnight parenting time with the Defendant.
   3.6. Because the Defendant now has suitable housing, and because the child’s circumstances (age, schooling, expressed wishes) and the practical effects of the current schedule have changed, there has been a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the 2019 order.

4. Legal Basis for Relief
   4.1. The UCCJEA, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, authorizes this Court to exercise jurisdiction over child custody determinations and modifications where Massachusetts is the appropriate forum.
   4.2. Massachusetts law—consistent with controlling constitutional principles—governs modification of custody and parenting time by prioritizing the best interests of the child, subject to parents’ fundamental liberty interests. See, e.g., Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing parental rights); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979).
   4.3. Courts recognize that a custodial or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances that affects the child's best interests. The facts set forth above constitute such a material change warranting modification of the existing order to reflect present realities and the best interests of the minor child.
   4.4. Relevant authorities include, without limitation: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (divorce and related provisions addressing custody determinations); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children and families generally); and pertinent decisions addressing parental rights and best-interests analysis, including Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982); Lassiter v. Dep’t of Social Servs., 452 U.S. 18 (1981); Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248 (1983); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429 (1984). (Plaintiff will rely upon applicable Massachusetts Commonwealth caselaw applying these principles at hearing.)

5. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   5.1. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the November 15, 2019 custody/parenting-time order.
   5.2. Modify the existing order to adopt the following parenting-time and custodial structure (or such other schedule as the Court deems in the best interests of the child):
        a. Defendant shall have regular overnight parenting time with the minor child, consisting of alternate weekend custody from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m., beginning the weekend following entry of the modification order;
        b. The weekday short visits currently scheduled (three short weekday visits) shall be eliminated to avoid disruptive midweek shuttling and to permit stable homework and bedtime routines; instead, the parties shall have one midweek evening visit by mutual agreement (e.g., Wednesday 5:00–8:00 p.m.) that does not include an overnight, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties or ordered by the Court;
        c. The parties shall work in good faith to develop a written parenting plan addressing holidays, school vacations, transportation, communication, medical care, and extracurricular activities; if the parties cannot agree on a parenting plan within 30 days, the Court shall order the parties to participate in mediation or appoint a parenting coordinator as appropriate.
   5.3. Order such temporary relief as is necessary pending the hearing on the modification (including reasonable parenting exchanges and communication protocols) so the minor child may begin weekend overnight visits at the Defendant’s home without further disruption.
   5.4. Award any other relief the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances, including costs and such further orders as will effectuate the best interests of the minor child.

6. Request for Expedited Hearing (if appropriate)
   6.1. Given that the current schedule frustrates the child’s school-night routine and both parents agree that modifications are warranted, Plaintiff requests that the Court setting a prompt hearing on this Complaint and, if the Court finds good cause, enter a temporary order permitting the Defendant to begin alternate weekend overnight parenting time pending final resolution.

7. Reservation of Rights
   7.1. Plaintiff reserves the right to request further modifications based on additional evidence and to supplement allegations and authorities at or before the hearing.

8. Certificate of Service
   I certify that on December 1, 2025, I will (or have) served a copy of this Complaint upon Tom Collins at his last known address, by first-class mail (and by any other method required by law).

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Rebecca Collins
