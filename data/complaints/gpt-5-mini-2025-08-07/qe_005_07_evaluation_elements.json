    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. The complaint states that Defendant is the owner and landlord of 123 Elm Street and that Plaintiff began renting the premises under a written lease beginning January 15, 2022, paying monthly rent (\u00b6\u00b62\u20133, 6). Those factual allegations put Defendant on notice of a landlord-tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. The complaint pleads specific omissions by Defendant: Plaintiff complained to Defendant on multiple occasions, Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants once but then declined to take effective action, and Defendant failed to abate or enforce the lease against the noisy tenants (\u00b6\u00b610\u201311, 16\u201317). Those allegations describe a landlord omission/failure to act to remedy the nuisance."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. The complaint describes repeated, ongoing, and severe noise (constant stomping, heavy walking at all hours, loud amplified music late at night, dragging/moving furniture near midnight, etc.) and asserts this conduct \"substantially and unreasonably interferes\" with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment (\u00b68). It also alleges concrete consequences\u2014averaging 4\u20135 hours of sleep per night and \"material interference\" with habitual use (\u00b612)\u2014sufficiently pleading substantial interference."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. The complaint links Defendant's inaction to the continuation of the interference: Plaintiff alleges she complained repeatedly, Defendant failed to take effective remedial measures, and \"as a direct and proximate result\" of the noise and Defendant's failure to act, Plaintiff suffered harm (\u00b6\u00b610\u201313, 17\u201319). Those allegations sufficiently plead that the landlord's omission caused the ongoing interference and resulting harm."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. The complaint lists specific actual damages (medical expenses for sleep medication, cost of earplugs and a white-noise machine, loss of sleep, a work warning for falling asleep, emotional distress, diminished use and enjoyment) and provides a damages estimate ($1,200) while reserving additional damages to be proven (\u00b6\u00b613, 19\u201320). These factual allegations adequately plead damage."
