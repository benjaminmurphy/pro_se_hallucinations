The plurality discusses the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard at length and holds that, as applied, the Washington statute\u2019s pure best\u2011interest regime impermissibly infringed fundamental parental rights. Thus, it is accurate to cite Troxel for recognizing fundamental parental rights and addressing the best\u2011interest inquiry, even though it does not concern UCCJEA jurisdiction or enforcement.",

Although the Court ultimately holds there is no automatic right to counsel in every termination case, it articulates the governing Mathews v. Eldridge balancing framework and discusses the nature and weight of the parent\u2019s interests, the state\u2019s interests, and the risk of error\u2014i.e., the procedural protections analysis in child welfare proceedings. Thus it is an appropriate authority for the general proposition that Lassiter concerns procedural protections in child welfare proceedings.",

Eldridge\u2026propounds three elements to be evaluated in deciding what due process requires, viz., the private interests at stake, the government\u2019s interest, and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions. We must balance these elements\u2026against the presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty.\u2026 We therefore adopt the standard found appropriate in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, and leave the decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in termination proceedings to be answered in the first instance by the trial court\u2026.\u201d"
