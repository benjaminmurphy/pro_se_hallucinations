COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Johnson”) is an individual and a tenant who resides at 252 Elm St., Worcester, Massachusetts 01605. Plaintiff’s contact information: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the residential dwelling located at 252 Elm St., Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 and, upon information and belief, resides or does business in Worcester County.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a tenancy for the premises located at 252 Elm St., Worcester, MA, commencing January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays Defendant monthly rent of $1,200.

4. This action is filed in the Worcester District Court because the defendant’s principal place of business/residence is in Worcester County and the subject premises are located in Worcester; the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court; and venue is proper in Worcester District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Beginning approximately three months prior to the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff first observed mouse droppings in the kitchen area of the rented premises.

6. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation and requested remediation.

7. In response, Defendant placed a small number of mouse traps in the unit and, on one occasion, arranged for a single visit by an exterminator.

8. The exterminator who inspected the building told Plaintiff that the problem was not likely to be resolved by a single visit and that a comprehensive, building-wide course of treatment was indicated.

9. Defendant declined to authorize comprehensive or repeated professional extermination services, telling Plaintiff that rodents are “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff needed to “keep [her] kitchen cleaner.” Plaintiff kept the kitchen in a clean condition and did not cause the infestation.

10. Despite Defendant’s limited remedial measures, Plaintiff continues to find mouse droppings in the kitchen on a regular basis (approximately weekly), and the problem persists.

11. As a direct consequence of Defendant’s failure to take adequate remedial action, Plaintiff incurred consequential losses including: discarded food (approximately $200) that was rendered unfit for consumption after evidence of contamination by rodents, and purchase of plastic food storage containers (approximately $80) to attempt to protect foodstuffs. Plaintiff estimates total out-of-pocket economic damages at $280.

12. The ongoing presence of mouse droppings and the landlord’s failure to take adequate corrective action have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, in particular her ability to safely prepare and eat food and to use the kitchen without fear or anxiety.

13. Plaintiff has made repeated oral requests for more comprehensive pest control measures. Defendant has refused to authorize sufficient building-wide or ongoing extermination and has obstinately relied on minimal measures (a few traps and a single exterminator visit) that Defendant knows or should know are inadequate.

14. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a continuing breach of obligations attendant to tenancy, including the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in leases under Massachusetts law and governing landlord-tenant principles.

LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to abate substantial and ongoing intrusions upon the tenant’s possession and use of the premises — including significant pest infestations that render premises unfit for ordinary residential use — constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord & Tenant §§ 15.3, 16.1 (recognizing covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties to prevent substantial interference); Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing that substantial housing defects and code violations may give rise to tenant remedies); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (discussing landlord obligations where habitability and quiet enjoyment undermined).

17. The State Sanitary Code and local housing and public health standards establish minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, and persistent rodent infestation is recognized as a condition inconsistent with the habitability and quiet enjoyment of rented premises. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health and sanitation statutes authorizing enforcement of sanitary standards).

18. Under general Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and related principles, a landlord is obligated to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s possession and use of the premises. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (general landlord-tenant law); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process provisions governing possessory disputes and rents) (authorities demonstrating the statutory framework governing landlord-tenant relations). Massachusetts courts and other authorities recognize that substantial interferences — including persistent infestations that a landlord negligently or intentionally fails to abate — can constitute breaches of landlord obligations and justify tenant damages and injunctive relief. See Javins, supra; Green, supra; Hilder v. St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church, 478 A.2d 202 (R.I. 1984) (treating landlord responsibility for infestation when landlord fails to afford reasonable remedy); see also Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord & Tenant §§ 15–17.

19. Defendant’s failure to take adequate remedial steps after notice and after at least one professional opinion recommending more comprehensive treatment constitutes an unreasonable refusal to abate a condition that substantially interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and is therefore a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered economic damages (replacement, disposal, and storage of food) and non-economic harm (inconvenience, anxiety, loss of full use of the kitchen, and loss of the quiet enjoyment of the premises).

- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant remedies where housing conditions substantially impair use).
- Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (addressing landlord duties regarding habitability and tenant remedies).
- Hilder v. St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church, 478 A.2d 202 (R.I. 1984) (infestation case addressing landlord responsibility).
- Additional authorities that treat landlord obligations and remedies for substantial interference with tenancy: See, e.g., authorities addressing housing standards and landlord obligations under state sanitary codes and common-law quiet enjoyment principles (collectively cited above and relied upon by courts assessing landlord responsibility for pest infestations and habitability problems).

(These authorities and the general principles they state are submitted in support of Plaintiff’s claim for relief for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.)

DAMAGES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

21. Plaintiff seeks relief against Defendant as follows:

Wherefore Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant for:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $280.00 for Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket losses (approximately $200 for spoiled/discarded food and $80 for storage containers), and damages for loss of quiet enjoyment and inconvenience in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $500.00; alternatively, the Court may award such compensatory damages as the evidence warrants;

B. An order for injunctive and/or mandatory relief requiring Defendant to retain, at Defendant’s expense, licensed pest control professionals to perform comprehensive, building-wide extermination and ongoing follow-up treatment as recommended by professionals within a reasonable time, and to take such other measures as necessary to abate the infestation and prevent recurrence;

C. Statutory costs and court costs as permitted by law;

D. Pre- and post-judgment interest to the maximum extent permitted by law;

E. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

(If the Court prefers to determine a monetary abatement of rent proportionate to the loss of use of the kitchen, Plaintiff requests that the Court award a rent abatement consistent with the diminution in value of the tenancy caused by the infestation for the period in which the condition persisted, and damages as above.)

JURY DEMAND

22. Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Notes and Important Information for the Court and Parties

- Plaintiff is proceeding pro se. If the Court prefers that Plaintiff file any additional or amended pleading or provide documentary evidence (receipts for discarded food and storage containers, communications to Defendant regarding the infestation, and any exterminator report), Plaintiff is prepared to file those documents upon request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like, I can produce a separate one‑page cover sheet, a proposed form of service, or an amended complaint adding exhibits (receipts, photographs of droppings, the exterminator’s written note, written communications with the Landlord) to attach as evidence. I can also prepare a concise proposed order for injunctive relief requiring comprehensive extermination if you would like to submit that to the Court.
