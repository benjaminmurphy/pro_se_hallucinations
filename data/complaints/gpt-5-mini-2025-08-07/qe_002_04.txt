v.                                                Docket No.: ___________

Susan Blake,
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Carter ("Plaintiff") is a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, residing at 45 Waverly Street, Basement Unit, Roxbury, MA 02119. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 or psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Susan Blake ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the "Premises") and at all relevant times was the landlord to Plaintiff.

3. Plaintiff began tenancy of the Premises on March 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Housing Court under Massachusetts law because the Premises are located in Roxbury (Suffolk County) and the action arises from a landlord-tenant relationship and an alleged breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and related landlord-tenant provisions); Boston Housing Court rules and practice.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. From March 1, 2022 through the present, Plaintiff has been a tenant in the basement unit at the Premises and has paid rent in the amount of $1,200 per month.

6. In October 2025 Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying rent due to medical bills. Plaintiff paid the outstanding rent and the landlord's late fee in full shortly thereafter. The short delay in October 2025 was resolved and rent was fully paid.

7. In November 2025, after a period of heavy rainfall, Plaintiff observed water seeping into the basement unit through a basement wall (the "Water Intrusion"). Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant by text message and Defendant responded that she would "look into it."

8. Despite Plaintiff’s notice and request for repair, Defendant failed to make any repairs or remedial efforts within a reasonable time. The Water Intrusion continued when it rained heavily.

9. Because health and safety concerns and the continuing water intrusion went unaddressed by Defendant, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston (the "City"). A City inspector visited the Premises, inspected the basement, and identified the presence of water infiltration and other housing code violations and/or housing-quality defects requiring remedial work. The City inspector’s visit confirmed the ongoing problem that Defendant had been notified of.

10. The Water Intrusion damaged Plaintiff’s personal property. A rug and a bookshelf placed against the affected basement wall were ruined/damaged. The reasonable replacement/repair value of the damaged personal property is approximately $400.

11. To control moisture and mold risk, Plaintiff has been running a dehumidifier continuously in the basement unit since discovering the Water Intrusion, resulting in increased electricity costs.

12. The Water Intrusion, the ongoing damp conditions, the need to run a dehumidifier constantly, and Defendant's failure to timely remediate the problem have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

13. After the City inspected the Premises, Defendant told Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 and called Plaintiff a "problem tenant." Defendant stated that the nonrenewal was because of the October late rent. The timing of Defendant’s statements and the sequence of events — City inspection after Plaintiff notified Defendant of the water problem, followed by the landlord’s refusal to renew and labeling Plaintiff a "problem tenant" — created a reasonable belief that Defendant’s decision not to renew was retaliatory in response to Plaintiff’s legitimate complaint about habitability and to the City inspection.

14. Defendant’s conduct — failing to timely repair/abate the water intrusion and related defects after notice, permitting ongoing conditions that damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, and communicating non-renewal and labeling Plaintiff a "problem tenant" shortly after Plaintiff reported habitability defects and the City inspected — constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in a residential tenancy.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord implicitly warrants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and that the premises will be fit for residential use; the landlord must not substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, nor permit conditions that deprive a tenant of substantial use and enjoyment after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord and tenant statutes); the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); see also the principles recognized in Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability), Kline v. 1500 Mass. Ave. Apartment Corp., 439 F.2d 477 (D.C. Cir. 1971), and as applied in landlord-tenant jurisprudence addressing landlord responsibility to repair and not substantially interfere with tenancy.

17. A landlord’s failure to repair conditions that materially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises after notice may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and entitle the tenant to damages and equitable relief. See e.g., Javins, 428 F.2d at 1080; Kline, 439 F.2d at 483; Restatement (Second) of Property §15.4 and §16.4 (landlord’s duty to repair and tenant’s remedies for breach).

18. A landlord cannot lawfully retaliate against a tenant for reporting code or health violations or exercising rights under housing law; retaliatory nonrenewal or threats may be relevant evidence of a breach of the covenant. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and related provisions governing landlord-tenant matters); case law recognizing that retaliatory conduct may violate tenant protections and the covenant of quiet enjoyment (see Javins, supra; Kline, supra; and related authorities).

19. Defendant had actual notice of the Water Intrusion and the adverse conditions in November 2025 and a reasonable opportunity to repair. Defendant's failure to timely correct the water intrusion and conditions that caused damage and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to: (a) damage to personal property in the amount of approximately $400; (b) increased electrical costs due to continuous operation of a dehumidifier; and (c) diminution of use and enjoyment of the Premises, emotional distress, and other consequential damages.

21. Plaintiff seeks all available remedies for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, including compensatory damages, declaratory and injunctive relief to abate the condition, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems equitable and just.
