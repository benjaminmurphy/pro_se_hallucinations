It explains that substantial defects in these essential services constitute a breach of the warranty and allow remedies such as rent abatement and damages, which aligns directly with the proposition that lack of essential services may breach the landlord\u2019s obligations.",

Additionally, the implied warranty of habitability covers all latent and patent defects in the essential facilities of the residential unit\u2026. In determining whether there has been a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, courts should inquire whether the claimed defect has an impact on the safety or health of the tenant.\u201d"
