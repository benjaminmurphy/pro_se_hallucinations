COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Quincy Family Restaurant ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.
2. Defendant Quincy Family Restaurant is a restaurant doing business at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts 02169.
3. This action arises from personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff on August 15, 2023 on real property owned, occupied, managed, leased, or controlled by Defendant at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts.
4. The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the District Court and this suit is properly brought in the Norfolk Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 214 and other applicable law.
5. Venue is proper in Norfolk County pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 2 and applicable statutes because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Quincy, Norfolk County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6. On August 15, 2023, at approximately dinner hours, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169.
7. Between the kitchen and the dining room there is a narrow tile-floored hallway used by restaurant staff and patrons to access restrooms and service areas.
8. While Plaintiff was dining, a server dropped a tray in the hallway containing several water glasses. The tray broke and water and ice were spilled onto the tile floor.
9. The server picked up the broken glass quickly but left the spilled water and ice on the tile floor. The server stated she would “be right back with a mop.”
10. The server did not place any warning, cone, sign, barrier, or other notice to alert patrons or staff that the hallway floor was wet and dangerous.
11. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose from her table and, unaware of the hazard, proceeded toward the restroom. The hallway floor remained wet; Plaintiff observed the tile looked shiny but did not perceive (and had no reasonable ability to perceive in advance of stepping on it) that there was a hazardous puddle of water and ice on the floor.
12. While walking through the hallway Plaintiff stepped on the water and slipped, twisting her knee severely and falling.
13. Following the fall Plaintiff sought medical attention at urgent care and was diagnosed with a severe knee sprain. Plaintiff was placed in a knee brace and prescribed physical therapy. Plaintiff incurred medical bills of approximately $2,500 and lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200 while recovering and attending medical appointments and therapy.
14. After Plaintiff’s fall, other Defendant employees were overheard by Plaintiff or others saying that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some period of time prior to the incident, indicating that Defendant’s staff knew or should have known of the dangerous condition but failed to take adequate corrective action or warn patrons.
15. The hazardous condition (spilled water and ice on a tile hallway) created an unreasonable risk of harm to invitees such as Plaintiff in the absence of timely cleanup, warning, or other reasonable precautions.
16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence as described below, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, loss of earnings, and other damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)
17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–16 as if fully set forth herein.
18. At all times relevant, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee on its premises, the duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, inspection, and safe condition of the premises, including the duty to warn of or remedy known dangerous conditions, to inspect the premises in a reasonably prudent manner, and to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to invitees. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (liability of possessor of land for physical harm) and related authorities.
19. Defendant breached the duties owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:
    a. Failing to properly and promptly remove, contain, or remedy the spilled water and ice after the tray was dropped;
    b. Failing to place adequate warning signs, cones, barriers, or other notice to patrons and staff of the wet floor;
    c. Failing to promulgate, enforce, or follow reasonable procedures to ensure prompt cleanup of spills in a narrow, patron-used hallway;
    d. Failing to reasonably inspect and supervise its premises and employees so as to discover and correct the hazardous condition in time to avert harm to patrons.
20. Defendant knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known of the existence and dangerous nature of the puddle of water and ice in the hallway. The server and other employees’ awareness that patrons were “dodging that puddle” establishes that the condition was known or should have been discovered and remedied by Defendant within a reasonable time before Plaintiff’s fall.
21. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages, including but not limited to physical injury, medical expenses (approximately $2,500), lost wages (approximately $1,200), pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and other economic and non-economic losses in an amount to be determined at trial.
22. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action, if any, and has brought this action within the applicable statute of limitations (see G. L. c. 260, §2A).

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITY
23. Plaintiff’s claim is governed by Massachusetts negligence and premises liability principles. Representative authorities include, without limitation:
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts §282 (duty to exercise reasonable care), §287–§289 (breach and causation), §343 (liability of possessor for physical harm caused by dangerous condition on land), and §343A (open and obvious risks; duty to warn).
    - Massachusetts statutes governing limitations and related procedural matters, including G. L. c. 260, §2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions), and the Massachusetts comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, §85.
    - Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court precedent addressing duty, inspection, notice, and liability of property possessors and occupiers to invitees, including Scheibel v. Hill, 368 Mass. 42 (1975) (negligence and jury questions), and other Massachusetts authorities construing premises liability and the standard of care for business owners toward invitees.
    - Treatises and secondary authorities such as Prosser and Keeton on Torts and the Restatement (Second) of Torts interpreting duty and premises liability principles.
24. Plaintiff will rely at trial on the foregoing statutes, Restatement provisions, and Massachusetts case law establishing that a business proprietor may be liable for injuries to invitees caused by hazardous conditions on its premises when the proprietor knew or should have known of the danger and failed to take reasonable action to remedy or warn of the danger.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:
A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including:
    1. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500;
    2. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200;
    3. An award for past and future pain and suffering, disability, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined at trial;
B. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;
C. For costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees if and to the extent permitted by law;
D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025

Notes and practical considerations (for Plaintiff’s information only):
- Plaintiff should confirm and, if necessary, supplement the citation list with specific Massachusetts cases directly on point (e.g., SJC and Appeals Court decisions regarding notice, constructive notice, and the duty to warn invitees). Representative Massachusetts authorities and Restatement provisions are cited above; Plaintiff may wish to consult a lawyer or legal resources for precise case law citations and discussion tailored to this fact pattern.
- Plaintiff should preserve all medical records, wage documentation, photos of the scene (if any), witness names and contact information, and any surveillance footage or incident reports from the restaurant.
- If filing pro se, Plaintiff should consult the Norfolk Superior Court local rules and filing requirements for format, filing fee, and service.
