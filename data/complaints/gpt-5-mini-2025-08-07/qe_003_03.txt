COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130)

Plaintiff Alex Rivera (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Jordan Morgan (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is an individual and tenant residing at 45 Green Street, Apartment (Studio), Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

2. Defendant Jordan Morgan is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130, and may be served at the same address.

3. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy/lease for the studio apartment located at 45 Green Street on or about February 1, 2022, and continues to occupy the premises as a residential tenant. Rent is $1,500.00 per month, paid to Defendant.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Jamaica Plain Division, because the premises are located within its territorial jurisdiction and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Prior to entering the tenancy, during a showing of the premises, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling in the main living area. Plaintiff asked Defendant about the stains.

6. Defendant represented to Plaintiff at the showing that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.” Relying on that representation, Plaintiff entered into the tenancy and moved into the studio.

7. On the first significant rainstorm after Plaintiff began occupancy, water began dripping through the ceiling in the exact location of the prior stains. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the leak and the ongoing ingress of water.

8. Defendant responded through multiple subsequent communications that the issue was a “minor cosmetic issue” and that Plaintiff had understood the apartment’s “character” at the time of signing the lease. Defendant declined to make prompt and effective repairs.

9. The water intrusion has increased in frequency and severity. During a later storm, water from the ceiling saturated Plaintiff’s couch and soaked a laptop left on the coffee table. The laptop was ruined; Plaintiff replaced it at a cost of approximately $900.00.

10. The chronic water intrusion has resulted in a persistent musty odor in the apartment and Plaintiff has experienced headaches which Plaintiff attributes to mold/mildew growth caused by the ongoing water intrusion.

11. Because of the ceiling leak and the musty conditions, Plaintiff has been forced to move the bed and other personal effects away from the affected area of the studio and has been, in practical effect, confined to using only roughly half of the unit.

12. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant repair the leak, remediate any resulting mold, and make the unit safe and habitable. Defendant has not made prompt, adequate repairs or taken steps to remediate the conditions and restore the tenant’s full use and enjoyment of the premises.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered actual monetary loss, inconvenience, loss of use and diminished enjoyment of the premises, and emotional distress. Plaintiff’s provable out-of-pocket damages related to damaged property (the laptop) total approximately $900.00. Plaintiff also reserves the right to seek additional appropriate damages, including diminution in rental value, for loss of use and other harms.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease (express or implied) contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment that guarantees the tenant’s right to the possession and use of leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord. A landlord’s wrongful failure to repair conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of that covenant.

16. Defendant’s representations that the prior leak had been “totally fixed,” its subsequent failure to repair or remediate the recurrent and worsening water intrusion, and its characterization of the ongoing water entry and resulting damage as merely “cosmetic” — together with Defendant’s refusal or failure to take timely and effective corrective action after repeated complaints — constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.

17. The water intrusion, property damage (including the ruined laptop), the development or risk of mold and associated odors and health effects, and Plaintiff’s resulting displacement within the unit demonstrate a significant diminution in the habitability and full use of the leased premises, and therefore constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

18. Plaintiff has given Defendant notice of the ongoing condition and an opportunity to cure, but Defendant has failed to do so.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer monetary damages and other harms, including: (a) $900.00 in actual damages for the ruined laptop; (b) loss of use of a significant portion of the premises and diminution in the value of the tenancy; (c) inconvenience and loss of quiet enjoyment; (d) costs of any reasonable temporary measures required for safety or mitigation; and (e) such other damages as the Court deems just and proper.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon and invokes the standards and authorities applicable to landlord obligations, habitability, and covenant of quiet enjoyment, including without limitation:

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (general landlord-tenant law)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health), including enforcement of sanitary code standards
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (consumer protection statute), where applicable to landlord practices
- 105 CMR 410.000, et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
- 780 CMR (Massachusetts State Building Code) (applicable building/structural standards)

Cases (illustrative and persuasive authority recognizing landlord duty and covenant of quiet enjoyment or habitability principles)
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies)
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (discussing tenant remedies for housing defects)
- [Plaintiff further relies upon Massachusetts appellate and Supreme Judicial Court precedent construing landlord duties and the covenant of quiet enjoyment and will provide specific Massachusetts caselaw at or before trial, consistent with discovery and any Court requirements.]

(Notes: Plaintiff pleads reliance on the cited statutes and regulations and on the common-law principles reflected in the cited cases. Plaintiff will supplement or identify additional Massachusetts authorities as needed in accordance with Court rules and deadlines.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in the amount of Nine Hundred Dollars ($900.00) for provable out-of-pocket losses (laptop replacement) caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. For an award of additional damages to compensate Plaintiff for the diminution in use and value of the tenancy, loss of quiet enjoyment, inconvenience, emotional distress, and other non-economic harms caused by Defendant’s breach, in an amount to be proved at trial;

C. For an order directing Defendant to make prompt and effective repairs to the premises, to remediate any mold and related health hazards, and to take all other actions necessary to restore Plaintiff’s full use and quiet enjoyment of the rental unit (injunctive and/or equitable relief);

D. For costs of suit and court filing fees;

E. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

F. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

CERTIFICATION AND SIGNATURE

Plaintiff certifies that, to the best of Plaintiff’s knowledge, information and belief, the factual allegations in this Complaint are true and accurate.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Alex Rivera
