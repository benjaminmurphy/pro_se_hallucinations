COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
   1.1 Plaintiff: Jessica Harrington (hereinafter "Plaintiff" or "Mother"), contact phone (617) 555-0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com. Plaintiff is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
   1.2 Defendant: Michael Harrington (hereinafter "Defendant" or "Father"). Defendant is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
   1.3 Minor child: Sophie Harrington, age 10 (hereinafter "the Child").

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court's authority to modify custody and parenting time orders entered in the Commonwealth.
   2.2 Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the Parties and the Child reside in the County and because the prior custody order was entered and is enforced in this Court.

3. Prior Order
   3.1 On April 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody/parenting-time order concerning the parties and the Child (the "Prior Order").
   3.2 The Prior Order awarded primary residence of the Child to the Father and awarded the Mother limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner visit per week. The Prior Order was entered based, in part, on the Mother's then-existing circumstances: she was enrolled in graduate school, living in a small studio apartment, and did not have a flexible work schedule.

4. Change in Circumstances — Material and Substantial
   4.1 Since entry of the Prior Order on April 15, 2018, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the Child and the ability of the parties to implement the Prior Order.
   4.2 Specifically:
        a. The Mother has completed her graduate degree.
        b. The Mother is now employed in a stable job with regular, predictable daytime hours and a schedule that permits weekday and overnight parenting time.
        c. The Mother now resides in a two‑bedroom apartment in which the Child has a separate bedroom and adequate space conducive to overnight custody and care.
        d. The Child is now ten years old. The Child has expressed a desire to increase residential time with the Mother. The Child’s therapist has evaluated the Child and has advised that the Child feels guilt at leaving the Mother after short visits and has expressed a preference for more regular, longer visits and additional overnights with the Mother. The Child has also prepared a written statement addressed to the Court expressing a wish for increased overnights with the Mother, which the Plaintiff will present to the Court in support of this modification.
        e. The Father refuses to discuss any change to the existing schedule; when the Child raises the subject the Father becomes angry and discouraging. The Father's unwillingness to cooperate or consider the Child's expressed wishes is affecting the Child emotionally and interfering with the Child's ability to have a meaningful relationship with the Mother.
   4.3 The foregoing facts constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Prior Order that warrants reconsideration of the custodial schedule under controlling Massachusetts law and caselaw concerning modification of custody and parenting time.

5. Best Interests of the Child
   5.1 Modification of the Prior Order is in the best interests of the Child. The Mother can now provide a stable, safe, and developmentally-appropriate home environment, has the time and resources necessary to care for the Child on additional overnights and weekends, and supports frequent, meaningful contact between the Child and both parents.
   5.2 The Child's expressed wishes, as reflected in statements to her therapist and in a written statement to the Court, favor increased time with the Mother. Consideration of the Child's reasonable preferences is appropriate under Massachusetts best-interests analysis given her age and maturity.
   5.3 Increasing the Child's time with the Mother will promote the Child's emotional well-being and stable parent-child relationship without evidence that such a change would harm the Child.

6. Relief Requested — Modification
   6.1 The Plaintiff requests the Court modify the Prior Order and enter a new order as follows (in the alternative to be determined by the Court based on the Child's best interests):
        a. Increase the Mother's parenting time to include additional overnights so that the Child has regular overnight stays with the Mother. Plaintiff proposes, as a reasonable starting point, an expanded schedule that provides the Mother with weekday overnight time and extended weekend time (for example, alternating mid-week overnights and an expanded weekend schedule such as two overnights every other weekend or a similar schedule as recommended by the Court or a custody evaluator).
        b. Adjust holiday and school-break parenting time to allow the Child to spend a fair and developmentally-appropriate share of vacations and school holidays with the Mother.
        c. Order the parties to attend mediation and/or parenting coordination to resolve scheduling and co-parenting disputes in good faith and under the Court's guidance.
        d. Any further relief the Court deems appropriate to protect and promote the Child’s best interests, including but not limited to limited exchanges at neutral locations, telephone and electronic contact, and a referral for a custody evaluation or therapeutic co-parenting intervention if the Court finds it helpful to resolve disputes or assess the Child’s needs.
   6.2 Plaintiff requests that the Court retain jurisdiction to effectuate any such order, make any necessary adjustments to child support if required by changes in parenting time and incomes, and award such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

7. Legal Basis for Modification
   7.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting-time orders may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and upon a demonstration that modification is in the best interests of the child. The facts set forth above satisfy those requirements.
   7.2 Plaintiff will rely on the statutes, rules, and controlling case law of the Commonwealth in support of this request and will provide the Court with any necessary affidavits, testimony (including from the Child's therapist), documents showing the Mother's changed living and employment circumstances, and the Child's written statement to the Court.

8. Requests for Relief
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   A. Schedule a hearing on this Complaint for Modification of Custody;
   B. Modify the Prior Order dated April 15, 2018, to increase the Mother's parenting time consistent with the Child's best interests and as described above (including additional overnights and expanded weekend and holiday time);
   C. Order the parties to attend mediation, parenting coordination, or a custody evaluation if the Court finds it appropriate to aid in resolving the parties' disputes and determining a parenting plan that serves the Child's best interests;
   D. Reserve and/or direct any adjustments to child support in accordance with the modified schedule and applicable child support statutes and guidelines;
   E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

9. Verification and Notice
   9.1 Plaintiff requests that this Complaint be served upon Defendant in accordance with the Probate and Family Court rules and that appropriate notice of hearing be provided.
   9.2 Plaintiff is prepared to provide sworn affidavits and documentary evidence at the time of hearing, including but not limited to verification of her changed residence and employment, and documentation/letters from the Child’s therapist and the Child’s written statement to the Court.

Respectfully submitted,

Date: December 1, 2025
