     Plaintiff
v.                                                      Docket No. ____________

MICHAEL SMITH
     Defendant
---------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff: Jessica Thompson, of residence in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: Michael Smith, address unknown to Plaintiff for purposes of this Complaint (service to be effected pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. and the Probate and Family Court Rules).
1.3 Children: Emma Smith, born 2017 (age 8); Liam Smith, born 2019 (age 6).
1.4 Original Order: A custody/parenting order affecting the above-named children was entered on May 15, 2021, in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court (hereinafter the “Existing Order”).
1.5 Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction to hear this complaint under the Probate and Family Court’s statutory authority over custody and care of minor children.

2. Relief Requested
2.1 Plaintiff seeks modification of the Existing Order to protect the best interests and safety of the children by (a) prohibiting the Defendant’s live-in partner (identified below) from being present in the household during the Defendant’s parenting time with the children; or alternatively (b) requiring that all of the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised (either by a mutually-agreed supervisor or by an agency-approved supervisor) until further order of the Court.
2.2 Plaintiff requests temporary emergency relief (ex parte or expedited hearing if appropriate) to require supervised visits or exclusion of the Defendant’s partner from parenting-time exchanges pending a full hearing on the merits, pursuant to the Court’s authority to fashion temporary orders to protect children’s welfare.
2.3 Plaintiff further requests such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs if applicable.

3. Background and Existing Custody Arrangement
3.1 At the time the Existing Order was entered on May 15, 2021, neither party was living with a new romantic partner; the Judgment does not contain provisions addressing new persons in the household during parenting time.
3.2 Under the Existing Order, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Emma and Liam. Defendant is entitled to alternate weekend parenting time and one midweek visit.

4. Facts Establishing Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, the Defendant has begun cohabitating with a new partner (hereinafter the “Partner”). The Partner has a known criminal history including convictions for assault and battery, and previously was subject to a restraining order issued by a former intimate partner. Plaintiff learned of the Partner’s criminal history through public records and credible third-party reports.
4.2 The children have told Plaintiff that the Partner yells frequently in the home and slams doors during arguments. The children have expressed fear and distress about being in the home during these episodes.
4.3 On one occasion the Partner grabbed one of the children hard enough to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm. Plaintiff observed the mark and the child reported being hurt by that contact.
4.4 A neighbor, while the children were present in the Defendant’s home during a visit, called the police because of a loud argument involving the Defendant and the Partner. Police responded and documented the disturbance.
4.5 The foregoing events—cohabitation with a partner who has a history of assaultive conduct, the children’s reports of yelling and frightening conduct, a physical contact that left a mark, and involvement of police—constitute a material change in circumstances since May 15, 2021.
4.6 The material change affects the children’s safety, welfare, and best interests and therefore warrants modification of the Existing Order to ensure protection of the children.

5. Legal Basis for Modification
5.1 The best interests and welfare of the child are the paramount considerations in custody determinations and modifications. When a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare occurs, the court may modify custody or parenting time to protect the child’s best interests.
5.2 The requested relief—excluding the Partner from the Defendant’s parenting time or requiring supervised parenting time—is narrowly tailored to protect the children from exposure to violent or destabilizing behavior and to ensure their safety during contact with the Defendant.
5.3 Plaintiff alleges that continued unsupervised parenting time in the presence of the Partner would pose a real risk of physical or emotional harm to the children and that supervised parenting time (or exclusion of the Partner) is necessary and appropriate.

6. Allegations in Support of Emergency/Special Relief
6.1 The events described in Paragraphs 4.1–4.4 are recent, ongoing, and present a risk of immediate and significant harm to the children’s physical and emotional welfare.
6.2 Absent expedited temporary relief ordering supervised visits or exclusion of the Partner from the Defendant’s custody time, there is a substantial risk that the children will suffer further harm or emotional trauma.
6.3 Plaintiff therefore requests that the Court schedule an expedited hearing and enter temporary relief as described in Paragraph 2.1 while this matter is adjudicated on the merits.

7. Facts Regarding Best Interests Factors
7.1 The children’s attachment to Plaintiff: The children reside primarily with Plaintiff, attend school in the community, and have established relationships with their schools, pediatricians, and neighbors.
7.2 Safety concerns in Defendant’s household: The Partner’s history of assaultive conduct, previous restraining order, police response to an argument while the children were present, the children’s reported fear, and a physical contact that left a mark on a child are relevant to the children’s safety and best interests.
7.3 The children’s wishes and psychological well-being: Given their ages (Emma, 8; Liam, 6), the children’s statements regarding fear and distress are supportive evidence the Court should consider in evaluating best interests.
7.4 Any additional factors the Court finds relevant to the children’s welfare and safety.

8. Request for Investigation and Protective Measures
8.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court (a) order an immediate assessment by the Court’s custody evaluator or other appropriate family services personnel; (b) order a child-safe exchange procedure for personal property exchanges and parenting-time transfers; and (c) consider any reports to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) or 51A inquiries as necessary to protect the children.
8.2 Plaintiff further requests that the Court order that the Defendant notify Plaintiff and the Court in advance of any intended change of residence or new cohabitation that would place the Partner in a household where the children will be present.

9. Case Law and Statutory Authorities (Non-exhaustive)
Plaintiff relies on the statutory and decisional law establishing the Court’s authority to modify custody and to protect children’s welfare and safety, including but not limited to:
Statutes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (Dissolution of Marriage; custody provisions and the court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody and care of minor children).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209 (Matters relating to family and children; jurisdiction over custody and modification).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (Abuse Prevention Act) (relevance of protective orders and history of abusive conduct to custody determinations).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, § 79 (contempt and enforcement procedures applicable to court orders).
- Rules of the Probate and Family Court and the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure governing modification and emergency relief.
Case Law (selected Massachusetts decisions recognizing material change standard and best-interests analysis)
- Cases recognizing modification where material change in circumstances affects child welfare and safety, and permitting courts to impose supervised visits or restrict contact (see, e.g., leading authority applying the “material change” standard and best-interests analysis).
- Cases addressing the court’s power to consider history of domestic violence, restraining orders, and criminal conduct in custody determinations (Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court authorities).
(Where specific case citations are required in briefing or at hearing, Plaintiff will supply pertinent published decisions from the Massachusetts Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court addressing material change of circumstances, best-interests factors, and restrictions or supervision of parenting time in situations involving violence or risk to children.)

10. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
10.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order such that modification of the custody/parenting-time provisions is warranted to protect the children’s best interests and safety;
10.2 Modify the Existing Order to prohibit the Defendant’s Partner from being present in the Defendant’s home or in the presence of the children during the Defendant’s parenting time; or in the alternative, order that all of the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised (by a mutually-agreed supervisor or by an agency-approved supervisor) until further order of the Court;
10.3 Issue temporary emergency relief (pending a full hearing) requiring supervised parenting time or exclusion of the Partner from the Defendant’s parenting time to protect the children from immediate risk;
10.4 Order any additional protective measures the Court deems necessary, including custody evaluation, DCF investigation or 51A assessment if appropriate, and safe exchange procedures;
10.5 Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including costs and attorney’s fees if warranted.

11. Verification
I, Jessica Thompson, verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing allegations are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Notes and Practical Guidance (for the Plaintiff)
- This Complaint requests an expedited hearing and temporary protective relief based on the children’s immediate safety needs. When filing, present any available supporting documentation (photographs of marks, police report number or incident report if available, written statements by the children or neighbor, school notes, medical records) to the Court to support the emergency relief request.
- If there is concern of ongoing danger, consider filing a 51A report with DCF; a DCF assessment can be relevant evidence for the Court at a custody modification hearing.
- If the Defendant’s partner has an active criminal conviction and/or restraining order history, secure and file certified records or certified court documents showing those matters, if available.
- If you need help serving the Defendant or requesting an ex parte temporary order, seek assistance at the Probate and Family Court clerk’s office; many clerks’ offices can assist unrepresented parties with filing forms and procedures, although they cannot provide legal advice.

Authority and Case Law Appendix (For Counsel/Briefing Purposes)
- Plaintiff relies generally on Massachusetts statutory law authorizing the Probate and Family Court to enter and modify child custody and parenting-time orders to protect children’s best interests and safety. Plaintiff will rely on and cite, as appropriate in subsequent filings and at hearing, controlling SJC and Appeals Court precedent on (a) the “material change in circumstances” standard for modification; (b) the best-interests analysis; and (c) the permissibility of ordering supervised visits or excluding particular people from parenting-time settings when necessary to protect children from harm (including cases applying those principles where evidence of domestic violence, prior restraining orders, or criminal assaultive history was relevant). Plaintiff will present specific citations to the Court at hearing.
