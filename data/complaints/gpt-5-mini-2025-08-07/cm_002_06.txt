Mark Thompson
    Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Sarah Johnson,  (phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com), is the primary residential parent of the parties’ minor child and the Petitioner in this action.
1.2 Respondent: Mark Thompson, is the other biological parent of the parties’ minor child and the Respondent in this action.
1.3 Minor child: Emily Johnson, born 2017 (age 8).
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statute and the applicable provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws governing custody, modification, and the welfare of minor children.

2. Relevant Procedural History
2.1 On April 15, 2021, this Court entered an order establishing the parties’ custody and parenting time schedule. Under that order, Petitioner was awarded primary physical custody of Emily, and Respondent was awarded custody on Wednesdays (midweek overnight) and every other weekend.
2.2 The 2021 order was entered with the assumption that both parents would remain reasonably proximate to each other and to Emily’s school and activities in the Cambridge area.

3. Statement of Facts and Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Since entry of the 2021 order, Respondent has obtained employment that requires him to relocate to New Hampshire. Respondent has informed Petitioner of his intention to move out of the Cambridge area to New Hampshire and to continue the exact midweek overnight (Wednesdays) and every-other-weekend schedule set forth in the 2021 order.
3.2 Respondent’s proposed continuation of the existing schedule will require Emily to travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in heavy traffic for midweek overnight visits. The travel time will therefore be approximately three hours of driving on a single midweek visitation including pickup and return.
3.3 Emily attends school in the Cambridge area and participates in after-school activities and programs. The long midweek drives are already causing Emily to experience anxiety and stress. She has expressed fear and reluctance about the long drives and reports missing or being unable to participate in her after-school activities when required to travel for a Wednesday overnight.
3.4 Because the midweek overnights would require Emily to leave after school and return very early the next morning to get to school on time, the proposed schedule will materially disrupt Emily’s regular school routine, extracurricular participation, and sleep schedule, and will impose undue physical and emotional burden on her.
3.5 The parties’ circumstances and the daily realities of Emily’s school and activities have therefore materially changed since entry of the 2021 order, such that the existing schedule is no longer consistent with Emily’s best interests.

4. Legal Standard
4.1 Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification of an existing custody order must demonstrate a material change in circumstances since the prior order and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, c. 209, and the body of Massachusetts caselaw holding that modification requires a showing of a material change in circumstances and a determination of the child’s best interests (see cases and statutes cited below).
4.2 The best-interests inquiry considers the totality of the child’s circumstances, including the child’s school schedule, activities, emotional needs, continuity, stability, and any specific harm to the child attendant to the existing arrangement. See cases cited below.

5. Cause of Action — Modification of Custody/Parenting Time
5.1 Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 4 above.
5.2 There has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2021 custody order: Respondent’s proposed relocation to New Hampshire and the attendant increase in travel time and disruption to Emily’s school and activities constitute changed circumstances that materially affect Emily’s welfare and the practical viability of the midweek overnight schedule.
5.3 The proposed continuation of a midweek overnight and unchanged every-other-weekend schedule would be detrimental to Emily’s physical and emotional well-being, interfere with her school attendance and participation in after-school activities, and is therefore not in Emily’s best interests.
5.4 Petitioner therefore requests that the Court modify the existing custody/parenting time order to remove the midweek overnight (Wednesdays) and to enter a revised parenting schedule that accounts for the distance between parents and Emily’s best interests. A proposed schedule would eliminate midweek overnight visits and provide Respondent with weekend parenting time that is practical given the travel distance (for example: extended every-other-weekend parenting time beginning Friday evening through Sunday evening, or alternative equally reasonable arrangements). Petitioner requests that the Court retain primary physical custody with Petitioner and enter parenting time for Respondent consistent with the best interests of Emily and the realities of Respondent’s New Hampshire residence.

6. Temporary Relief Requested
6.1 Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court issue temporary relief enjoining Respondent from commencing midweek overnight parenting time (i.e., continuing Wednesdays as overnight visits) pending final hearing on this Complaint, to prevent further disruption to Emily’s schooling and emotional stability while this matter is adjudicated.
6.2 Alternatively, Petitioner requests that the Court enter temporary measures eliminating midweek overnights and providing for alternative weekend parenting time pending final hearing.

7. Best Interests Factors and Supporting Allegations
7.1 The requested modification is supported by the best-interests of the child factors recognized and applied by Massachusetts courts, including but not limited to: Emily’s age and developmental needs; her school schedule and extracurricular activities; the physical distance between parents and travel time; continuity and stability of residence and schooling; Emily’s emotional responses and anxiety caused by long travel; and the capacity of each parent to provide for Emily’s needs. The facts alleged above demonstrate that removal of the midweek overnight and revision of the weekend schedule are in Emily’s best interests.
7.2 Petitioner is prepared to present evidence (including testimony, school attendance records, activity schedules, and any necessary medical or counseling records) to prove the material change in circumstances and the child-centered need for the requested modification.

8. Legal Authorities (Representative Statutes and Cases)
Petitioner relies upon the governing statutes and controlling Massachusetts caselaw addressing modification of custody and parenting time, including but not limited to:

Statutes:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (Divorce and related family provisions)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209 (Guardianship of minors / custody-related provisions)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (Abuse Prevention — relevant if allegations arise)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§ 39 & 51A (child welfare and reporting obligations where relevant)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 (procedure and enforcement provisions in certain contexts)

Sample Massachusetts Caselaw (illustrative, non-exhaustive):
- Custody modification requires proof of a material change in circumstances and that modification is in the child’s best interests: see, e.g., SJC and Appeals Court decisions interpreting the standard and best-interests inquiry;
- Cases addressing relocation and distance as a factor in custody modification and parenting time adjustments;
- Cases addressing the impact of school attendance, extracurricular activities, and emotional health on custody determinations.

(For ease of reference at hearing, Petitioner will provide the Court with a supplemental compendium of controlling Massachusetts statutes and relevant SJC and Appeals Court decisions identifying the material-change and best-interests standards, including leading decisions interpreting these principles and applying them to relocation and travel-time issues.)

9. Request for Relief
Wherefore, Petitioner Sarah Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
9.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the April 15, 2021 custody order warranting modification;
9.2 Permanently modify the custody/parenting-time order to:
    a. Remove the midweek overnight (Wednesdays) from Respondent’s parenting time schedule; and
    b. Adjust Respondent’s parenting time to an arrangement that accommodates the distance to Respondent’s New Hampshire residence and is in Emily’s best interests (for example, reasonable extended weekend parenting time such as every-other-weekend from Friday evening through Sunday evening, or other schedule as the Court deems appropriate);
9.3 Maintain Petitioner as the primary physical custodian of Emily;
9.4 Grant the temporary relief requested in paragraph 6 above, pending final hearing;
9.5 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including costs and attorneys’ fees where authorized.

10. Certification
Petitioner certifies that the statements in this Complaint are true to the best of her knowledge and belief and that this Complaint is brought in good faith.

Date: December 1, 2025
