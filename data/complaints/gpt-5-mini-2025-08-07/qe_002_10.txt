COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Williams, and complains against Defendant Laura Smith as follows:

PARTIES
1. Plaintiff Jordan Williams (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Williams”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the basement unit of 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.
2. Defendant Laura Smith (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Smith”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA and, upon information and belief, resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or does business therein.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to applicable provisions governing landlord-tenant matters and small claims and civil actions in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division. Venue is proper in this Division because the premises that are the subject of this action are located in Roxbury, Massachusetts.
4. This action arises out of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied by law in Massachusetts residential tenancies and related duties to maintain premises in habitable condition.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Plaintiff began renting the basement unit at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA on March 1, 2022, pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy/lease (the “Tenancy”). Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00.
6. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying rent due to unexpected medical bills. Plaintiff paid the outstanding rent and the landlord’s asserted late fee in full thereafter.
7. In November 2025, after a period of heavy rain, Plaintiff discovered water seeping through the basement wall at the rental unit. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message. Defendant responded that she would “look into it.”
8. Several weeks passed and no effective remedial action was taken by Defendant to stop the water intrusion, to repair the deteriorated wall, or to abate the hazardous and habitability issues resulting from repeated water penetration.
9. Concerned for health and safety and after no repairs were made, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston (building inspectors/health/code enforcement). City inspectors came to the premises, inspected the unit, and noted the water infiltration and additional code-related defects/violations.
10. As a result of the water intrusion, Plaintiff’s rug and a bookshelf placed against the affected wall were damaged and rendered unusable. Plaintiff estimates replacement and repair costs of approximately $400.00 for those damaged personal items.
11. Because of the ongoing dampness and moisture risk from repeated seepage, Plaintiff has been forced to operate a dehumidifier on a continuous basis to prevent mold and to try to preserve the habitability of the unit, resulting in increased electricity usage and higher utility costs to Plaintiff.
12. Defendant has not effectuated repairs sufficient to stop the water intrusion or to remedy the defects noted by City inspectors; the problem remains ongoing as of the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025).
13. Within recent weeks, Defendant informed Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it terminates in March 2026. Defendant stated that her reason for nonrenewal was Plaintiff’s past short late rent payment in October 2025. Plaintiff believes and alleges that the stated reason is pretextual and that Defendant’s refusal to renew is motivated, at least in part, by Plaintiff’s involvement with the City inspection and/or reporting or complaining about the condition of the premises.
14. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent when due (except the brief late payment in October 2025 that was promptly cured), complied with the tenancy’s obligations, and otherwise acted in good faith.

LEGAL BACKGROUND (select authorities)
15. Massachusetts law implies a covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential tenancies; a landlord’s conduct that substantially interferes with a tenant’s lawful use and enjoyment of the premises may constitute a breach of that covenant. See Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and related doctrines affecting tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment); see also general landlord-tenant principles recognized under Massachusetts law and applicable housing and sanitary codes.
16. The Massachusetts Sanitary Code sets forth minimum standards of fitness for human habitation and authorizes municipal enforcement when conditions present hazards to health and safety. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); see also M.G.L. c. 111, §127 (public-health enforcement authority).
17. Summary process and landlord-tenant statutes govern rights and remedies for tenants and landlords in Massachusetts and provide the substantive and procedural context for enforcement of tenants’ rights. See M.G.L. c. 239 (Summary Process); see also M.G.L. c. 186 (landlord and tenant laws).
18. Massachusetts caselaw recognizes that a landlord’s persistent failure to correct defects that materially impair a tenant’s use of the premises can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and support tenant damages or equitable relief. See, e.g., Javins, supra; see also Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (discussing warranties of habitability and remedial rights); see also analogous decisions and treatises recognizing the tenant’s right to habitable housing and to be free from substantial interferences with enjoyment.
19. Courts have also held that landlord conduct that appears retaliatory in response to a tenant’s complaint to code enforcement or similar governmental authorities may be evidence of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or other wrongful conduct. See, e.g., Javins, supra; see also cases recognizing protection against retaliatory evictions and abuse of landlord remedies.

CAUSE OF ACTION
COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts Common Law)
20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.
21. At all relevant times, the Tenancy created an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, under which Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to refrain from substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and to maintain the premises in a condition that does not deprive Plaintiff of their reasonable use and enjoyment.
22. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, among other things:
    a. Failing to repair and abate ongoing water intrusion through the basement wall after notice from Plaintiff and after City inspection revealed defects and code violations;
    b. Allowing a condition (recurrent water infiltration, dampness, and associated hazards) to persist that materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises;
    c. Failing to take timely and effective remedial action after being put on notice of the problem; and
    d. Engaging in or threatening retaliatory nonrenewal of Plaintiff’s tenancy shortly after Plaintiff complained and after City inspection — conduct that has chilled and interfered with Plaintiff’s rights and enjoyment of the premises.
23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:
    a. Damage to personal property (rug and bookshelf) in the approximate amount of $400.00;
    b. Increased electricity and utility costs from continuous use of a dehumidifier;
    c. Loss of quiet enjoyment and diminution of habitability; and
    d. Other consequential damages to be proved at trial.
24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, together with interest, costs of suit, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

B. An order awarding interest, costs of suit, and such other statutory interest as provided by law from the date of loss or breach;
C. An order directing Defendant to repair and abate the water intrusion and related defects so that the premises conform to applicable habitability standards and housing codes (injunctive or equitable relief to abate ongoing interference), or, in the alternative, a declaration that Defendant’s continued failure to remedy the defects constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including attorney’s fees if authorized by statute or contract and any other relief available under Massachusetts law.
