Michael Smith
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
   1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Collins ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2 Defendant Michael Smith ("Defendant") is the father of the parties' two children and a party to the existing custody order entered by this Court on June 15, 2020.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1 This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law over custody and modification proceedings. See G. L. c. 208, § 31; G. L. c. 209B (UCCJEA).
   2.2 Venue is proper in Bristol Probate and Family Court because the children primarily reside with Plaintiff in Bristol County and the existing order was entered in this Court.

3. Children
   3.1 The modification sought concerns the custody/parenting time of the parties' minor children:
       - Ethan, age 8;
       - Emma, age 6.

4. Existing Order
   4.1 On June 15, 2020, this Court entered an order establishing joint legal custody with Plaintiff as primary physical custodian and parenting time for Defendant consisting of every-other-weekend custody and one agreed overnight during weekdays ("Existing Order").

5. Facts Establishing Material Change in Circumstances
   5.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children.
   5.2 Defendant has taken a new employment position working night shift hours (approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) several nights per week, including many of the nights when he is scheduled under the Existing Order to have overnight custody.
   5.3 Because of his night work schedule, Defendant frequently arrives home exhausted, and has on numerous occasions dropped the children off at Plaintiff’s home with very little notice—sometimes after the children have already been scheduled to be in his care overnight—or left them in the care of a roommate or other adult with whom Plaintiff has little familiarity.
   5.4 The children have reported to Plaintiff that Defendant sometimes falls asleep after arriving home from work while the children are under his care; they have at times fallen asleep on the couch while Defendant naps.
   5.5 Defendant’s lack of reliable, alert supervision at times when he is scheduled to have overnight parenting time has created a risk to the children’s health, safety, and stability and has resulted in disruption to their routines, schooling, and sleep schedules.
   5.6 Plaintiff has attempted informal resolution and has asked Defendant to confirm his availability before scheduled overnights, but Defendant has not agreed to a reliable process and continues to leave the children in Plaintiff’s care with little notice when his work schedule conflicts with his parenting-time obligations.

6. Legal Standard
   6.1 Under Massachusetts law, modification of a custody/care arrangement requires a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the existing order that affects the best interests of the child. See G. L. c. 208, § 31; see also G. L. c. 209B (UCCJEA jurisdictional provisions); Custody of a Minor, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); McWeeney v. McWeeney, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1990); Palmiero v. Palmiero, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1996).
   6.2 The court’s paramount concern is the best interests of the child—evaluating the child's safety, welfare, stability, and developmental needs and the ability of each parent to care for the child. See LaFleur v. LaFleur, 447 Mass. 719 (2006); D'Amico v. D'Amico, 396 Mass. 579 (1985); Branch v. Branch, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1983).
   6.3 Massachusetts caselaw makes clear that changes in parental employment or availability that materially affect parenting time and the child’s welfare can justify modification of custody/parenting time. See, e.g., Porreca v. Porreca, 399 Mass. 724 (1987); Crawford v. Crawford, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 202 (1998); Fenton v. Fenton, 426 Mass. 293 (1997); Ferguson v. Ferguson, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 123 (1993); see generally Custody of a Minor (No. 1), 400 Mass. 551 (1987).
   6.4 The court may also order interim relief and modifications that preserve the children’s safety and stability pending a full hearing. See Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. (applicable practice and procedure); cases interpreting same regarding interim orders and hearings. See, e.g., Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 344 (1983); Lerner v. Lerner, 431 Mass. 256 (2000).

7. Cause of Action — Request to Modify Custody and Parenting Plan
   7.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–6 above.
   7.2 The development of Defendant’s night-shift employment and the resulting pattern of inadequate supervision and abrupt drop-offs of the children constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the Existing Order and adversely affect the children’s safety, welfare, and best interests.
   7.3 Accordingly, Plaintiff asks this Court to modify the Existing Order to ensure the children’s safety, stability, and consistent routines, including but not limited to modification of Defendant’s overnight parenting time to reflect his actual availability and to require advance notice and confirmation when Defendant’s schedule may interfere with his parenting time.

8. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   8.1 Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order that affects the children’s welfare and that modification is warranted;
   8.2 Modify the parenting schedule so that Defendant’s overnight parenting time is permitted only on nights when Defendant is actually off work and able to provide responsible, awake supervision of the children. In the alternative, require that: (a) Defendant’s overnight parenting time be converted to daytime parenting time on days when he has worked a night shift; or (b) Defendant must provide at least 48 hours’ advance written (email or text) confirmation of his availability to exercise any overnight parenting time, with failure to confirm rendering the overnight void and custody of the children remaining with Plaintiff;
   8.3 Enter such interim and temporary orders as are necessary to protect the children’s safety and well-being pending a final hearing, including but not limited to immediate temporary suspension of overnight parenting by Defendant on any night in which Defendant has worked a night shift ending within twelve (12) hours of the scheduled overnight;
   8.4 Require Defendant to provide Plaintiff and the Court with his work schedule on a weekly basis while this matter is pending and to notify Plaintiff of any schedule changes affecting planned parenting time;
   8.5 If the Court deems appropriate on the facts presented at hearing, order evaluation by a guardian ad litem or court-appointed evaluator and any parenting education or counseling recommended by the Court;
   8.6 Award Plaintiff costs and expenses of this action (including reasonable attorney’s fees, if any) and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable; and
   8.7 Grant any additional relief necessary to effectuate the children’s best interests under G. L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant authorities.
