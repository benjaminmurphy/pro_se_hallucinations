COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson ("Plaintiff"), pro se, states the following Complaint against Defendant, William Carter ("Defendant"), and alleges:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is an individual and a tenant residing at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Apt. __, Dorchester, MA 02124.

2. Defendant is Plaintiff’s landlord and owner/manager of the premises located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, MA 02124, and may be served at that address.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant are subject to the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The rental tenancy began on August 1, 2022.

4. The rent for the two-bedroom apartment is $2,200 per month. Plaintiff has paid rent when due and is current.

5. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts statutes governing landlord-tenant disputes and torts, and venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court (Dorchester Division) because the premises and the parties are located in Dorchester.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. During the winter season of 2024–2025 (roughly December 2024 through March 2025), Plaintiff experienced repeated episodes in which the apartment’s central heat would drop substantially, often to approximately 60°F, for periods of several hours, usually in the evenings.

8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating problem. Defendant arranged for repairs on two separate occasions.

9. The first repair visit temporarily improved heat delivery for approximately one week; thereafter the problem recurred.

10. On the second repair visit, the repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and indicated there was not much more that could be done to improve the condition. No permanent repair that resolved the intermittent inadequate heating was performed.

11. As a result of the recurring inadequate heat, Plaintiff purchased two electric space heaters to maintain a livable temperature in the apartment. Plaintiff’s electric bills increased by approximately $150 per month during the months she used the space heaters.

12. In January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis. Plaintiff’s treating physician stated that the illness was probably made worse by prolonged exposure to cold indoor air. Plaintiff missed three days of work as a result of the illness and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses for treatment including antibiotics.

13. Defendant has responded to Plaintiff’s complaints by asserting that the heating system is “working” because it never goes completely out and the overall building is not frozen. Defendant has refused to make or secure effective, lasting repairs to prevent recurrent substandard heating.

14. Defendant’s actions and omissions—failing to timely and adequately repair the heat so that the apartment was reasonably habitable and fit for the purposes for which it was let, and failing to abate the recurrent interference with heat despite notice—have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

15. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct in an amount of approximately $600 for out-of-pocket expenses (increased electric bills and medical expenses), and seeks recovery of those damages herein.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law and Massachusetts Law)

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law (and longstanding common law principles recognized by Massachusetts courts), a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, which includes the right to possession and beneficial use of the premises without substantial interference by the landlord. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) and related authorities.

18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached by landlord conduct that substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Constructive eviction or substantial interference may occur where essential services provided by the landlord—such as adequate heat during winter—are not furnished or are inadequately furnished after reasonable notice and opportunity to cure.

19. Defendant’s failure to effectuate adequate, lasting repairs to the heating system after repeated complaints, his acceptance of conditions that left the apartment intermittently unheated to roughly 60°F for multi-hour periods, and Defendant’s refusal to take effective remedial measures constitute a material interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.

20. Plaintiff provided Defendant with notice of the problem and the opportunity to remedy it. Despite two repair visits, the condition continued and Defendant failed to secure a lasting remedy; Defendant’s response that the heating was “working” because it never completely failed does not excuse the recurring unacceptable indoor conditions.

21. Defendant’s breach caused Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses including increased electric bills for supplemental heating and medical expenses related to bronchitis that was aggravated by cold indoor conditions, and caused loss of use and enjoyment of the rented premises.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of approximately $600, together with costs, interest, and any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

APPLICABLE STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon the following statutes, regulations and authorities in support of the legal theory and as applicable guidance to the Court (non-exhaustive list):

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general statutory framework governing residential tenancies).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process) (procedures affecting landlord/tenant matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and the public health authority of local boards of health (public health standards applicable to residential premises).
- 105 CMR 410.000, State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation (standards for heat, ventilation, and habitable housing).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act) (limited relevance to landlord practices; reserved rights).
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant (principles concerning covenant of quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction).

Leading and Persuasive Case Law
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognition of implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies; widely cited in landlord-tenant jurisprudence).
- (Massachusetts authorities recognizing protection for tenants’ rights to habitable premises and quiet enjoyment; courts look to common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment and public-health based standards when assessing landlord obligations.)
- (Additional persuasive authorities addressing constructive eviction, substantial interference with habitability, landlord notice and opportunity to cure, and tenant damages under breach of covenant principles.)

Plaintiff specifically invokes and will rely upon the statutes and regulatory standards cited above, as well as controlling and persuasive case law on the covenant of quiet enjoyment, constructive eviction, and landlord obligations to provide essential services and habitable housing.

(If required by the Court, Plaintiff stands ready to provide a fuller list of on-point Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court decisions and supporting authority at or before trial; Plaintiff cites Javins as an influential decision and relies on Massachusetts statutory and regulatory standards set forth above.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $600.00 for out-of-pocket expenses proximately caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (increased electricity expenses and medical expenses), or such other amount as the Court finds just and proper;

B. Awarding costs of this action and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable;

C. Awarding pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and

D. Granting any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.
