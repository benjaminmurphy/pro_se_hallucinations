COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Michael Smith (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is a resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, MA 01605, which is the subject premises in this action.

2. Defendant Michael Smith is the owner and landlord of the residential rental premises located at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, MA 01605 where Plaintiff resides.

3. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for the subject premises commencing on May 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Worcester District Court.

5. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Worcester District Court because the subject premises are located in Worcester and the acts complained of occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff reincorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. Beginning approximately three months before the filing of this complaint, Plaintiff began to notice mouse droppings in the kitchen area of the apartment.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent infestation and requested effective remediation.

9. Defendant responded by placing a small number of mouse traps. Two mice were caught. Defendant did hire a professional exterminator for a single visit. The exterminator advised that the building required a more comprehensive, systematic treatment to eradicate an established rodent infestation.

10. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for the recommended comprehensive extermination, stating that occasional rodent sightings are “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff should keep the kitchen cleaner.

11. Plaintiff has maintained the apartment in a clean and sanitary condition. Plaintiff’s efforts to keep food sealed and kitchen surfaces clean have been diligent; despite this, rodent droppings continued to appear on a weekly basis.

12. As a direct result of Defendant’s refusal to undertake adequate extermination and abatement measures, Plaintiff has been forced to discard approximately $200.00 worth of food that was contaminated or potentially contaminated by rodents, and to purchase plastic, rodent-proof food containers costing approximately $80.00. Plaintiff therefore seeks damages totaling $280.00 for personal property loss and reasonable replacement costs.

13. The ongoing infestation and Defendant’s failure to abate it have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Plaintiff is anxious about cooking or eating in the kitchen and fears the health risks posed by rodents and rodent droppings. The infestation has substantially impaired the habitability and quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

14. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable, effective measures to eradicate the rodent infestation, despite actual notice and opportunity to cure, constitutes a continuing and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s possession and enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff reincorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and common law, a tenant has a right to the quiet enjoyment of leased premises and a landlord has an obligation not to substantially interfere with that right. A landlord’s failure to remedy conditions that materially impair the tenant’s use and enjoyment may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

17. The rodent infestation and Defendant’s refusal to authorize necessary, comprehensive extermination and remediation have deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment and use of the kitchen and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

18. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has sustained actual damages in the amount of $280.00, consisting of spoiled food and replacement containers, and is entitled to recover such damages, together with costs, interest and other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF / PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $280.00;

B. Award Plaintiff pre- and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

C. Award Plaintiff costs and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including any other relief allowable under Massachusetts law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; and

D. Grant Plaintiff such further relief as the Court may deem proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts statutory and regulatory law and established landlord-tenant principles recognizing the tenant’s right to possession and quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord and tenant statutes governing tenancies and related rights and remedies);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and applicable public health statutes regulating habitability and sanitary housing conditions;
- 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) and related public health codes and local housing codes applicable in Worcester regarding infestations and vermin;
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing that substantial defects that render premises unfit for their intended use may constitute a breach of the tenant’s rights);
- Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (discussing landlord obligations and tenant remedies for substandard conditions);
- Park W. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979) (discussing habitability and landlord obligations);
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (warranty of habitability and related landlord obligations);
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 12.1 and related sections (authoritative treatise guidance on quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations);
- Cases and authorities recognizing that chronic vermin or rodent infestation that materially interferes with occupancy may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or render premises untenantable under applicable law;
- Applicable Worcester housing codes and regulations governing landlord duties to maintain premises free from infestations and to take appropriate extermination and remediation measures.

Plaintiff reserves the right to rely on additional statutes, regulations, codes, and caselaw as may be applicable and discovered in the course of litigation.
