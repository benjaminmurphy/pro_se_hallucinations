It does not discuss residential tenancies, covenants of quiet enjoyment, landlord obligations, or tenant remedies. Accordingly, this case does not provide authority for the stated proposition about an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in Massachusetts residential tenancies.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "On appeal, Liberty argues that, because it did not consent to accepting less than full reimbursement from the proceeds of the third-party action, the judge was not authorized to approve the proposed settlement. Liberty points out that the statutory language does not invest the judge with the authority to choose what amount shall be refunded, unless agreed upon by the workers\u2019 compensation insurer. We think that this construction is supported by both the pertinent legislative history and the case law interpreting the statute."
