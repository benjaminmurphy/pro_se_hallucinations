    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Exclusive claim: Breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff" or “Turner”) is an individual and a resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s mailing address is 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Roberts ("Defendant" or “Roberts”) is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”). Upon information and belief Defendant resides and/or conducts business in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

3. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for the two-bedroom apartment at the Premises with Defendant on or about January 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of $1,800.00.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) and general jurisdictional statutes for contract and tort matters heard in the Boston Municipal Court. Venue is proper in the Dorchester Division because the Premises is located in Dorchester, Suffolk County.

FACTS

5. Plaintiff rents the two-bedroom apartment at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA from Defendant pursuant to an oral/written tenancy beginning January 1, 2022.

6. During the winter of 2024–2025 (the relevant period), the heating system in Plaintiff’s apartment repeatedly failed to maintain adequate heat. On numerous evenings the indoor temperature would drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for hours at a time.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the recurring inadequate heat. Defendant sent maintenance/repair personnel to the Premises on at least two separate occasions. The first repair temporarily improved the heating but the condition recurred about one week later. The second technician inspected the boiler and stated it was “old but functional” and indicated there was not much more to do.

8. Despite the repairs, the inadequate heating persisted intermittently throughout the season, requiring Plaintiff to obtain alternative means of supplemental heat.

9. To maintain habitable conditions and daily functioning during the periods of inadequate heat, Plaintiff purchased and used two electric space heaters. The increased electricity use resulted in an approximately $150 per month increase in Plaintiff’s electric bills for several months.

10. In January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis. Plaintiff’s treating physician concluded that Plaintiff’s bronchitis was likely aggravated by exposure to prolonged cold indoor air. As a result of the illness Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses for a doctor visit and prescription antibiotics.

11. Defendant has repeatedly represented that the building’s heat is “working” because the boiler never completely failed and the building was not freezing at all times. Defendant’s assertions ignore the recurring and intermittent failure of the heating system to maintain reasonable indoor temperatures at Plaintiff’s apartment and the consequent effects on Plaintiff’s health, safety, comfort, and use of the Premises.

12. The recurring inadequate heating materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, made the apartment uncomfortable and unhealthful at times, increased Plaintiff’s monthly expenses, and caused physical illness and lost wages.

13. Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses related to the inadequate heating (purchase of space heaters, increased electric bills) and consequential damages (medical expenses, lost wages).

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord is subject to an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord’s acts or omissions materially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, or render them substantially unsuitable for their intended use. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 12.1 (covenant of quiet enjoyment); see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes generally governing rights and obligations of landlords and tenants).

16. The State Sanitary Code and related Massachusetts law establish minimum standards for habitability, including adequate heat and safe living conditions. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation; heating and maintenance requirements); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health enforcement). Failure to provide heat sufficient to maintain reasonable indoor temperatures, particularly during cold months, can constitute a violation of habitability standards and can support a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the defect materially interferes with the tenant’s use of the premises.

17. By permitting the heating system to repeatedly fail to provide adequate heat in Plaintiff’s apartment and by failing to repair or replace the heating system so as to stop the recurring lapses in adequate heating, Defendant committed acts and omissions that substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises.

18. Defendant’s conduct caused actual damages to Plaintiff, including but not limited to: increased utility expenses (approximately $150 per month attributable to supplemental electric heat), the cost of purchasing two space heaters, medical expenses for treatment of bronchitis, lost wages from three missed work days, and general inconvenience, discomfort, and distress.

19. Plaintiff has attempted to notify Defendant and to obtain adequate repairs; Defendant’s responses (sending repair persons twice, with only temporary fixes, and statements that the boiler is “old but functional”) have been insufficient to eliminate the recurring interference with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the Premises.

20. Defendant’s breach is continuing in nature because the heating system remains old and prone to intermittent failure, and the resulting interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises has recurred and may continue absent remedial action.

21. Under Massachusetts law, tenants who suffer a substantial interference with use and enjoyment caused by a landlord’s breach of obligations (including failures related to habitability and essential services) may recover damages for their losses. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 12.1 (remedies for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment); see generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. Courts in Massachusetts have recognized that inadequate heat and repeated failures of essential services can constitute grounds for relief. (Authorities cited below.)

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to the out-of-pocket expenses cited above and other consequential damages.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF (PRAYER)

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount sufficient to fairly compensate Plaintiff for the losses caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:
   1. reimbursement for increased utility costs (approximately $150 per month for the months affected);
   2. reimbursement for the cost of two electric space heaters;
   3. medical expenses incurred as a result of bronchitis attributable to the inadequate heat;
   4. lost wages for three days of work missed due to illness;
   5. other proven consequential and general damages, including damages for discomfort and loss of use.

B. Award Plaintiff the sum of $500.00 in damages as presently calculated (subject to amendment based on proof at trial), representing Plaintiff’s current good-faith estimate of recoverable damages arising from Defendant’s conduct; and/or such other amount as the Court determines to be appropriate following proof.

C. Award pre- and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law.

D. Award Plaintiff the costs of suit and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

E. Grant such further relief as the Court deems equitable, including injunctive relief if warranted to compel permanent repair or replacement of defective heating equipment or to otherwise abate the continuing interference.

ATTORNEY’S FEES

23. Plaintiff brings this action pro se. To the extent applicable statutory or equitable authority exists for an award of attorneys’ fees for violations of statutory habitability or other rules, Plaintiff reserves the right to seek attorneys’ fees; alternatively, Plaintiff seeks costs and other relief as permitted by law.

PRAYER FOR JURY TRIAL

24. Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
