COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Reynolds ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605. Plaintiff may be contacted by telephone at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, and is the landlord from whom Plaintiff rents the apartment.

3. Plaintiff began renting the apartment from Defendant on or about September 1, 2021, under a periodic tenancy for which Plaintiff pays $1,400.00 per month in rent.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the subject premises are located in Worcester and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Beginning approximately three months before the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff began to observe and find rodent droppings in the kitchen of the rental unit at 73 Elm Street.

6. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant about the rodent evidence and the ongoing infestation concerns. In response, Defendant placed a limited number of snap traps in the unit and arranged for a single visit by an exterminator.

7. The single exterminator visit confirmed that the building requires more comprehensive and periodic treatment to eliminate the rodent infestation and recommended follow-up treatments and building-wide remediation. Defendant declined to authorize comprehensive treatment, stating that some presence of mice is "normal for older buildings" and that Plaintiff should keep the kitchen "cleaner."

8. Plaintiff maintains the kitchen and the rented premises in a clean and sanitary condition and, notwithstanding reasonable cleanliness, continued to find droppings weekly. The presence of droppings persisted despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and Defendant’s limited efforts.

9. As a direct result of the continuing rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to undertake reasonable and timely remedial measures to abate the infestation, Plaintiff suffered pecuniary loss: she discarded approximately $200.00 worth of food items that were contaminated or at risk of contamination and purchased $80.00 of plastic food storage containers to protect remaining food items.

10. Plaintiff also has suffered physical and emotional distress, including anxiety and loss of quiet enjoyment of her home. She feels unable to cook or eat in her own kitchen without concern for contamination.

11. Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to resolve this matter with Defendant but has been unable to obtain adequate remediation. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a continuing deprivation of Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and to inhabitable premises under applicable Massachusetts law and regulations.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11 above.

13. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was in lawful possession of the rented premises and Defendant was the landlord with control over the building’s maintenance and pest control.

14. Under Massachusetts law, and the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in leases, a landlord must not substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises and must take reasonable steps to remedy conditions that substantially impair habitability and the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the landlord’s obligations and tenant’s remedies in the presence of housing code violations); see also applicable Massachusetts law and regulations cited below.

15. The continuing rodent infestation, Defendant’s refusal to authorize comprehensive and reasonably necessary extermination and remediation recommended by a licensed exterminator, and Defendant’s insistence that the presence of rodents is merely "normal for older buildings" constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and a breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. The alleged interference is material and continuing and has caused Plaintiff to suffer both economic damages (replacement and disposal of contaminated food; purchase of food storage containers) and non-economic harm (anxiety, loss of the ability to use the kitchen without fear). Plaintiff’s economic losses total approximately $280.00.

17. Because Defendant has failed to take reasonable measures to abate the condition, Plaintiff is entitled to damages and injunctive relief to end the continuing breach.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $280.00 for documented economic losses resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. Award additional general damages for loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and inconvenience in an amount to be determined at trial;

C. Enter an injunction ordering Defendant to undertake and complete comprehensive extermination and remediation of the building and the Plaintiff’s unit consistent with the recommendations of licensed pest control professionals and in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and other applicable standards and regulations (including, but not limited to, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.) to abate the rodent infestation;

D. Award Plaintiff her costs of suit and other relief the Court deems just and proper, including reasonable attorney’s fees if permitted by statute or applicable law;

E. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

APPLICABLE STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND AUTHORITIES (Representative)

Plaintiff relies upon Massachusetts statutory and regulatory law and relevant case authority recognizing a tenant’s right to habitability and quiet enjoyment and a landlord’s obligations to maintain rental premises in a fit and habitable condition. Representative authorities include, without limitation:

Statutes and Regulations
- Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186 (Landlord and Tenant statute generally) and pertinent sections therein governing landlord obligations and tenant remedies;
- Massachusetts General Laws chapter 111 (public health; sanitary regulations and nuisance abatement authority);
- Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A (consumer protection statute) (as background authority regarding unfair or deceptive practices by landlords, where applicable);
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., Code of Massachusetts Regulations (State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation);
- Applicable local Worcester health and housing codes and regulations (as enforceable by local boards of health).

Cases and Authorities (Representative)
- Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant remedies for housing code violations and landlord duties);
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and landlord obligations) (persuasive authority);
- Massachusetts appellate and trial court decisions applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties (authority includes decisions interpreting landlord obligations under M.G.L. ch. 186 and building and health codes);
- Authorities addressing landlord liability for pests, nuisance, and habitability under state and local housing codes, including cases finding breaches of quiet enjoyment where landlords failed to abate infestations or permit habitability;
- Local Worcester Board of Health enforcement guidance and decisions relating to infestations and landlord remediation obligations.

(Notes: Plaintiff will rely on and cite specific Massachusetts cases and statutory sections in pre-trial filings and at trial as appropriate. Representative categories above are provided to show the legal framework; Plaintiff intends to rely on binding Massachusetts authorities construing the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the landlord’s maintenance obligations, and abatement remedies, and on 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. and local housing codes addressing vermin and infestation as standards establishing Defendant’s obligations.)

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
