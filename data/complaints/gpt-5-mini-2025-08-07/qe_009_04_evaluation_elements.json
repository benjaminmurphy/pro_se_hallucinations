      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately pleaded: Complaint alleges a residential tenancy beginning January 15, 2022, rent payments of $1,200/month, and that Defendant is the owner/landlord of the Premises (\u00b6\u00b61\u20135, 3)."

    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately pleaded: Plaintiff alleges Defendant arranged an electrician but has acknowledged the need for substantial repair, is \u201cgetting quotes,\u201d has delayed work, and has not restored electricity or provided a timeline (\u00b6\u00b68\u201311, 14). These allegations describe affirmative responses plus the landlord's omission/failure to complete necessary repairs."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately pleaded: The complaint alleges one of two bedrooms has lacked electricity for ~six weeks, rendering the bedroom unusable (it was used as a home office), forcing Plaintiff to work elsewhere and incur recurring expenses, and materially impairing use of the living area (\u00b6\u00b66\u20137, 12\u201313, 18). Those facts plausibly allege a deprivation of beneficial use sufficient to constitute substantial interference."

    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately pleaded: Complaint links Defendant\u2019s knowledge and failure to repair (\u00b6\u00b68\u201311, 14) to the lack of electricity and the resulting loss of use and expenses, alleging the damages are a direct and proximate result of the condition and Defendant\u2019s inaction (\u00b6\u00b612, 20, 21)."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately pleaded: Plaintiff specifies actual out\u2011of\u2011pocket damages of $720 (coffee shop and coworking expenses), and also alleges inconvenience, loss of exclusive possession of part of the premises, and diminution of use (\u00b6\u00b612\u201313, 15, 20\u201321)."
