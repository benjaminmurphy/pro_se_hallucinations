Samuel Thompson,
   Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

INTRODUCTION

1. This is an action by Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell for damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s lease under Massachusetts law. The Defendant landlord has failed to abate repeated, substantial and ongoing noise disturbances from tenants in the building despite repeated notice, causing Plaintiff loss, discomfort and financial harm.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell is an individual and a tenant who resides at 25 Union Square, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.

3. Defendant Samuel Thompson is the landlord and record owner/manager of the property at 25 Union Square, Somerville, Massachusetts, and may be served at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA 02143 or at such other place as the Court may direct.

4. Plaintiff entered into a lease for the premises located at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA 02143 beginning on January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,800.00.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in the Somerville District Court. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court because the premises at issue are located in Somerville and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Somerville.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the rented premises at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA since January 1, 2022 under a written lease that includes the express covenant of quiet enjoyment and Plaintiff’s right to peaceful occupancy.

7. In approximately June 2025 (about six months prior to the filing of this Complaint), new tenants moved into the apartment directly above Plaintiff’s unit.

8. Since that time the upstairs tenants have created continuous, excessive and unreasonable noise, including frequent heavy stomping and footfalls, loud music late at night, and noises consistent with moving furniture around midnight and at other late hours.

9. The noise is recurrent and severe enough that it routinely wakes Plaintiff and prevents Plaintiff from obtaining normal sleep. Plaintiff is averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night as a direct result of the noise.

10. Plaintiff has personally requested on multiple occasions that the upstairs tenants reduce the noise. The tenants temporarily reduced the noise for approximately one week, but then resumed the disruptive behavior.

11. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant landlord about the ongoing noise disturbances on approximately five to six separate occasions over the past six months. On at least one occasion Defendant spoke briefly with the upstairs tenants and thereafter told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”

12. Defendant, despite notice of the interference from Plaintiff and despite having authority or control over the tenancy at the premises, has failed to take adequate remedial action to abate the substantially interfering noise.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises, including but not limited to:
   a. Severe and repeated sleep deprivation (averaging four to five hours of sleep per night);
   b. A written warning at work for falling asleep on the job;
   c. Medical treatment and a prescription for sleep medication that Plaintiff now pays $40.00 per month to obtain;
   d. Out-of-pocket costs for earplugs, a white-noise machine, and other measures taken to attempt to mitigate the disturbance;
   e. General discomfort, stress, loss of quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the home; and
   f. Other incidental and consequential damages.

14. Plaintiff has attempted reasonable self-help and remedies and has notified Defendant of the problem repeatedly, but Defendant has refused or failed to take appropriate action to abate the disturbance.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law and the common law applicable to landlord-tenant relationships, a lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment that guarantees the tenant’s right to possession and reasonable, peaceful use and enjoyment of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or others under the landlord’s control. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 15 (1977); see also Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied obligations in residential leases).

17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord, having notice of substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, fails to take reasonable steps within the landlord’s control to abate the interference. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 16; see also cases recognizing landlord liability for substantial interference where landlord had notice and control.

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff the obligation to take reasonable steps to abate or prevent substantial interference with Plaintiff’s possession and enjoyment of the premises once the Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the problem.

19. Defendant had actual notice of the repeated, substantial noise disturbances affecting Plaintiff (Plaintiff complained to Defendant approximately five to six times and Defendant spoke with the upstairs tenants at least once).

20. Despite notice and control over the tenancy at the building, Defendant failed to remedy or meaningfully abate the ongoing, substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, thereby breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered compensable damages as alleged above, including but not limited to medical expenses, out-of-pocket costs, lost wages or disciplinary action at work, emotional distress, discomfort, and loss of the benefit of the bargain of the lease.

DAMAGES

22. Plaintiff alleges general and special damages, including but not limited to:
   a. Compensatory damages for inconvenience, discomfort and loss of quiet enjoyment;
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses totaling at least $40.00 per month for medication and additional reasonable costs for earplugs and a white-noise machine;
   c. Any economic losses or other damages resulting from the disturbance (including any lost earnings or diminishment of earning capacity due to sleep deprivation);
   d. Costs and disbursements of suit; and
   e. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest where permitted by law.

23. Based on the information available and the harm described above, Plaintiff seeks an award of damages in the amount of $1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred dollars) for the breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, together with costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend and supplement the damages claim after discovery.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $1,200.00, or in such other amount as the evidence supports at trial;
B. Costs and disbursements of this action;
C. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as allowed by law;
D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
