Michael Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Residence
1.1 Plaintiff Laura Smith ("Plaintiff" or "Mother") is an individual residing in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be served at: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Michael Johnson ("Defendant" or "Father") is an individual believed to reside in Barnstable County (Cape Cod), Massachusetts. Defendant’s last-known contact information and address are within the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 The minor child subject to this action is:
- Emily Johnson, born [DOB withheld; age 8].

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters and modification of custody orders under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 208 (allocation of parental responsibility and divorce-related custody), and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209D. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the parties and the child are residents of Barnstable County and the existing order was entered in this Commonwealth on August 15, 2019.

3. Existing Order
3.1 A custody order entered on August 15, 2019 establishes that Plaintiff has primary custody of Emily and Defendant has parenting time every other weekend plus one midweek overnight on Wednesdays (the “2019 Order”).

4. Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 At the time the 2019 Order was entered, the parties lived in the same town and the Wednesday midweek overnight involved a short drive; the child was able to attend school the next morning without undue hardship.
4.2 Since entry of the 2019 Order, Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school. Defendant nevertheless continues to exercise the Wednesday midweek overnight in the same form as in 2019.
4.3 Defendant routinely picks Emily up from school on Wednesdays, drives her to Cape Cod, has an overnight, and then returns her the next morning. To arrive to school on Thursday morning, Defendant commonly wakes Emily at approximately 4:30 a.m. to drive back for school. These are lengthy, early-morning drives on a school night.
4.4 As a direct result of the travel required by the Defendant’s continued Wednesday overnight, Emily experiences persistent exhaustion. Her teacher has reported a noticeable drop in class participation and alertness on Thursdays, as compared to other weekdays.
4.5 The Defendant’s relocation and the resulting travel demands were not contemplated by the parties or by the Court at the time of the 2019 Order and were not temporary in nature. The travel regimen described above has been occurring regularly since Defendant’s relocation.
4.6 The change in circumstances described in Paragraphs 4.2–4.5 is substantial and material and has adversely affected Emily’s health, sleep, and school functioning.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Under Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the existing order that affects the welfare of the child and warrants modification in the child’s best interests. See generally G.L. c. 208 (statutory authority for custody orders and modifications); G.L. c. 209D (UCCJEA) (jurisdictional provisions); accord Massachusetts cases applying the material-change/best-interest standard. Relevant authorities include, by way of example and illustration: G.L. c. 208 (Custody provisions); G.L. c. 209D (UCCJEA); G.L. c. 119 (child welfare); and controlling Massachusetts precedent establishing that modification requires both a material change and a best-interests analysis. (See, e.g., well-established Massachusetts jurisprudence holding these principles.)
5.2 The best interest of the child is the paramount consideration for this Court when fashioning a modified custody and parenting schedule. The Court considers physical and emotional needs of the child, stability, school functioning, parental ability to meet needs, and any negative effects of parental arrangements on the child’s health and education.

6. Allegations of Material Change and Harm to Child
6.1 Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s relocation to Cape Cod (approximately ninety miles from Emily’s school), followed by his continued exercise of a Wednesday midweek overnight that requires long, early-morning travel back to school, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 Order.
6.2 Plaintiff alleges that the ongoing long-distance travel and early-morning returns have caused Emily to suffer chronic sleep deprivation, decreased classroom participation, and materially impaired school functioning, thereby adversely affecting Emily’s health, welfare, and best interests.
6.3 Plaintiff alleges that continuation of the current schedule would pose a continuing risk of harm to Emily’s sleep, school performance, and overall well-being.

7. Relief Requested — Modification of Parenting Time and Elimination of Midweek Overnight
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
7.1 Finding that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 Order such that modification is warranted;
7.2 Eliminating the current Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time granted to Defendant and ordering that Defendant shall no longer take Emily overnight on Wednesdays; and
7.3 Modifying the weekend parenting time schedule (without restricting Defendant’s reasonable parenting time) to provide an alternative arrangement that (a) reduces or eliminates long-distance overnight travel on school nights; (b) permits meaningful parenting time for Defendant without requiring Emily to undertake lengthy, early-morning drives on school nights; and (c) ensures school attendance and adequate sleep for Emily (examples to consider: extended alternate-weekend parenting time on non-school nights, or shifting to daytime midweek parenting time that does not require overnight travel that interferes with school);
7.4 Awarding such further, other or different relief as the Court deems appropriate in the best interests of Emily, including but not limited to orders for parental cooperation on transportation, reasonable notice, exchange locations, and (if the Court deems appropriate) a limited parenting coordinator or mediation to implement a practical schedule that prevents school-night travel and protects Emily’s health and education;
7.5 Granting such costs, fees, and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

8. Authority and Support (Representative Statutes and Case Law)
Plaintiff relies upon the governing statutory authority and case law for modification of custody orders and the best-interest standard, including without limitation:
Statutes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (custody and related provisions, including authority to enter and modify orders affecting minor children).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209D (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children and youth protections; child welfare provisions) — general welfare considerations.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, various provisions applicable to probate practice and the Probate and Family Court.
- Other statutory authorities applicable to custody and parental responsibility as may be relevant under Massachusetts law.

Representative Massachusetts Case Law (illustrative, non-exclusive)
- Massachusetts case law holds that modification of child custody requires a showing of a material change in circumstances since the prior order and that the child’s best interests are paramount in determining whether modification is warranted.
- The Court should consider Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court precedent addressing the material-change requirement and best-interests evaluation in custody modification matters, as well as jurisprudence addressing the effects of parental relocation and the impact on a child’s schooling and welfare. Plaintiff will rely upon applicable Massachusetts decisions interpreting the statutory standards and setting forth factors to be weighed by the Court at the time of hearing.

(Please note: specific statutory sections and case-law citations will be relied upon and briefed in detail at hearing and in any supporting memorandum of law filed with the Court. Plaintiff expressly reserves the right to cite additional statutes, rules, and cases in support of her position.)

9. Notice and Service
9.1 Plaintiff will arrange for service of this Complaint upon Defendant in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and Probate and Family Court Rules for modification proceedings.
9.2 Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint and issue any temporary orders necessary to protect Emily’s health and school functioning pending a final determination on the merits.

10. Verification
10.1 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Notes and Practical Guidance (for filing and court use)
- Plaintiff requests that the Court consider short-term interim relief (e.g., suspension of the midweek overnight or an order that midweek parenting time be exercised only through daytime visits, or that exchanges occur at a mutually agreeable location that does not require school-night overnight travel) pending a full hearing.
- Plaintiff will supplement this Complaint with a supporting affidavit, any school/teacher statements, and proposed revised parenting schedule when filing with the Court.
- Plaintiff intends to file a proposed parenting schedule that eliminates overnight school-night travel and provides for meaningful weekend parenting time without compromising Emily’s sleep and school performance.

End of Complaint.
