    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant owned, controlled, maintained, and/or occupied the building and had responsibility for the adjacent sidewalk and an obligation to keep it reasonably safe for invited users (delivery persons). These factual allegations adequately plead a landowner duty."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific conduct: Defendant shoveled only a narrow path, failed to apply de-icing material, ignored tenant texts/photos notifying her of the ice, and otherwise failed to take reasonable remedial or warning measures\u2014facts that adequately plead a breach of the duty to maintain the sidewalk safely."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the icy zone created by Defendant\u2019s narrow-shoveling/no-deicer practice caused Plaintiff\u2019s feet to slip and led to her fall and injury.

      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the harm (slip-and-fall on ice) was a foreseeable consequence of leaving an untreated, refrozen shoveled path and that Defendant had notice of the condition. Those facts adequately plead proximate (foreseeable) causation."

      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete special damages (approx. $2,500 medical expenses and $800 lost wages) and general damages for pain and suffering \u2014 facts sufficient to plead actual damages."
