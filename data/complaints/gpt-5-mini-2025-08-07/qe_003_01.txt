Olivia Martinez,
     Plaintiff,

v.

James Houghton,
     Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Olivia Martinez, and brings this Complaint against Defendant, James Houghton, and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Olivia Martinez is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant James Houghton is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”). Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Defendant may be served at the Premises or at any other usual place of service.

3. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy of the studio apartment at the Premises beginning on February 1, 2023, and has continuously rented the Premises since that date. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,300.00 to Defendant.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Boston Housing Court’s jurisdiction over housing matters and actions for possession or related landlord-tenant disputes (see generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239; rules and statutes governing the Housing Court).

5. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain (City of Boston), and because this action concerns the landlord-tenant relationship and housing conditions at those premises.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. During the showing of the Premises prior to executing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling above the main living area and asked Defendant about them.

7. Defendant represented to Plaintiff at that time that the stains were the result of an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”

8. Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s representation and entered into the tenancy.

9. During the first significant rainstorm after Plaintiff moved in, water began to drip from the ceiling in the same location as the stains observed at the showing.

10. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the leak on multiple occasions thereafter and requested repair. On each occasion Defendant responded that the condition was a “minor cosmetic issue” and described the apartment as having pre-existing “character” which Plaintiff “knew” when she signed the lease.

11. The leaking has worsened over time. During one storm the leak soaked Plaintiff’s couch and damaged her laptop, which Plaintiff had left on a coffee table; the laptop was ruined and Plaintiff replaced it at a cost of approximately $900.00.

12. The leak has created a persistent musty odor in the apartment, and Plaintiff has experienced recurring headaches which she reasonably believes are related to mold growth connected to the ongoing water intrusion.

13. As a result of the leak and mold concerns, Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed away from the affected area and is effectively occupying and using only approximately one-half of the unit for living purposes.

14. Defendant has failed to undertake timely, adequate repairs or to abate the leak and related conditions despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and despite Defendant’s earlier representation that the leak had been “totally fixed.”

15. Defendant’s conduct has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, depriving Plaintiff of the full and intended benefit of her tenancy.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law — Massachusetts)

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, by which a landlord must refrain from substantially interfering with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises. This covenant may be breached by affirmative acts or by the landlord’s failure to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with habitability and the tenant’s peaceful enjoyment. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenants’ rights against conditions that defeat quiet enjoyment and habitability); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (treating covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord’s obligations to maintain premises).

18. The duty of a landlord to provide and maintain premises in a condition fit for their intended use is supported by Massachusetts statutes and regulations addressing landlord-tenant responsibilities and housing standards, including (but not limited to) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health), and the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000), which establish minimum standards for habitable dwelling units and public health standards. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111.

19. Massachusetts courts and other authorities recognize that a landlord’s failure to repair persistent water intrusion, mold, or similar conditions that materially interfere with the tenant's use of the property may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and give rise to damages, rent abatement, and other remedies. See Javins, supra; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant; see also cases and authorities addressing landlord responsibility for habitability and quiet enjoyment (collectively addressing the same principles).

20. Defendant’s representations that the leak had been “totally fixed” and subsequent failure to effect timely and adequate repairs, combined with ongoing water intrusion, property damage, the emergence of musty odor and suspected mold, and the resulting restriction on Plaintiff’s use of the Premises, constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

21. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment was and is the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages, including property damage (the ruined laptop), inconvenience, diminution in use of the Premises, emotional distress and discomfort, and other economic loss.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages in an amount to be proved at trial but presently estimated at not less than $900.00 in out-of-pocket property damage (laptop replacement) and an additional amount for loss of use, diminution in value of the tenancy, and other consequential damages. Plaintiff asserts a total damages claim in the amount of $900.00 for property loss and, alternatively, seeks reasonable damages for loss of use and other consequential harms as proved at trial.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Olivia Martinez respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $900.00 for the damaged laptop and related out-of-pocket expenses, plus additional compensatory damages for loss of use of the Premises, inconvenience, diminished habitability, and other consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial;

B. Pre- and post-judgment interest where allowed by law from the date of accrual of damages;

C. Costs of suit and filing fees;

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including any rent abatement or other equitable relief the Court finds appropriate under the circumstances; and

E. Any other relief available under applicable law.

ATTORNEY FEES

23. Plaintiff expressly does not assert a separate statutory claim for attorney’s fees at this time, but reserves the right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs if a statutory basis for fees is later shown or permitted by law.

SUPPORTING AUTHORITIES (Representative)

Plaintiff relies upon the following authorities in support of the legal theory that the landlord’s failure to repair persistent water intrusion and related conditions breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may give rise to damages and equitable relief:

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process and jurisdictional provisions applicable to housing matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health authorities and powers relating to housing conditions).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- Local housing and health codes applicable in the City of Boston.

Treatises and Restatements
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (discussion of covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations).

Leading Cases and Authorities (illustrative)
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant remedies for landlord failures affecting habitability and quiet enjoyment).
- [Other Massachusetts and federal decisions recognize and apply the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord repair obligations in the context of water intrusion, mold, and habitability conditions; Plaintiff will rely on controlling Massachusetts precedent and Housing Court practice at hearing and trial.]

(Notes: Plaintiff will rely on and cite specific Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Massachusetts Appeals Court decisions addressing the covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord repair obligations, and tenant remedies in support of the claim at hearing and trial; Plaintiff identifies the authorities above as representative legal grounding for the cause of action pled.)

TRIAL BY JURY

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
