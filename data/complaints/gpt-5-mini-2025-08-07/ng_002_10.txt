COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), by counsel or pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant John Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual and resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant John Thompson is an adult individual who, upon information and belief, resides in or around Newton, Massachusetts and at all times relevant maintained control and custody of a large dog that Defendant permitted to run unleashed in Newton Commonwealth Park.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold for this court.

4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court, Newton Division, because the tort occurred in Newton Commonwealth Park, Newton, Massachusetts. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 4 (venue for actions against individuals).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully and peacefully jogging on a public path in Newton Commonwealth Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

6. Newton Commonwealth Park is a public place where signage posted by the City of Newton requires dogs to be leashed. On information and belief, these signs were visible at or near the location where Plaintiff was running.

7. Defendant owns, keeps, and controls a large dog (the “Dog”). Defendant had actual and constructive knowledge of the requirement that dogs be leashed in Newton Commonwealth Park.

8. On September 15, 2023, Defendant was present in the park with the Dog. Defendant held a leash over his shoulder but had not attached the leash to the Dog. The Dog was running loose on or near the jogging path.

9. Defendant frequently allows the Dog to run loose in the park despite the posted leash requirement; other park users have observed Defendant’s customary practice of permitting the Dog to be off-leash.

10. As Plaintiff jogged on the path, the Dog suddenly charged toward her while barking aggressively. Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away speaking with friends at the time and did not restrain the Dog or call it back immediately.

11. Fearing imminent attack and uncertain whether the Dog would bite her, Plaintiff swerved off the paved path to avoid the Dog. While so avoiding the Dog, Plaintiff tripped over a concealed tree root at the edge of the path, fell down a small embankment, and sustained a fractured wrist.

12. The Dog never made physical contact with Plaintiff; the Dog ceased advancing when Plaintiff fell. Defendant then called the Dog back and restrained it.

13. Several other joggers witnessed the incident and are potential witnesses to the Dog’s aggressive behavior and Defendant’s lack of control.

14. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff was transported to the emergency department, was diagnosed with a broken wrist, required medical treatment including immobilization in a brace, incurred approximately $3,500 in medical bills, and was forced to miss work and a piano recital for which she had been practicing (lost wages and other economic losses approximately $1,200).

15. Plaintiff’s injury, pain and suffering, disability, medical expenses, lost income, and other damages were proximately caused by Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in controlling and restraining the Dog and by permitting the Dog to be loose in violation of the park’s leash rule.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Negligence

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law, a person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to others. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 302B; Town of Lexington v. Leno, 436 Mass. 456, 466 (2002) (recognition of duty principles); see also Massachusetts negligence jurisprudence describing duty, breach, causation, and damages.1

18. Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully using the park and its paths, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in controlling the Dog and to comply with posted leash requirements, thereby preventing foreseeable injury to foreseeable users of the park. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518A (owners’ duty regarding animals); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140 (dog-control statutes and regulation of animals in public places).

19. Defendant breached that duty by allowing the Dog to run loose in the park despite posted leash requirements, by not attaching the leash or otherwise restraining the Dog while in close proximity to other park users, and by failing to call or otherwise control the Dog promptly when it charged toward Plaintiff.

20. Defendant’s breach was a proximate and actual cause of Plaintiff’s fall, physical injuries (including a fractured wrist), medical expenses, lost income, and other damages. Defendant’s conduct created the very risk of harm that resulted: an uncontrolled dog charging a passerby, causing that person to take evasive action and be injured. See, e.g., Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause principles); see also cases recognizing foreseeability and proximate causation in dog-related incidents and premises liability contexts.

21. Plaintiff’s damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence and include, but are not limited to: (a) medical expenses in the approximate amount of $3,500; (b) past lost earnings and income in the approximate amount of $1,200; (c) pain and suffering, disability, inconvenience, emotional distress, loss of the enjoyment of life, and other non-economic losses in an amount to be determined at trial; and (d) costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (illustrative and applicable)

22. The elements of negligence—duty, breach, causation, and damages—are well-established in Massachusetts law and the common law. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 281–288 (elements of negligence); Prosser & Keeton on Torts §§ 30–32 (5th ed.); see also Wiseman v. Jinsai, 472 Mass. 1002 (2015) (discussing duty and foreseeability); Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability/proximate cause).

23. Massachusetts statutes and regulations govern the control of dogs in public places and the responsibilities of dog owners. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140 (General provisions concerning animals and dogs, including leash and owner responsibilities); see also local ordinances and park regulations (City of Newton park rules requiring leashing of dogs).

24. Massachusetts caselaw recognizes owner liability for negligent handling or control of animals where such negligence causes foreseeable harm to others. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518A (duty of animal owners), and Massachusetts cases applying similar principles. See also Schwartz v. Shepard, 343 Mass. 118 (1961) (liability of keeper of animal for injuries caused by the animal’s dangerous tendencies); Smith v. Rogers, 350 Mass. 543 (1966) (control and foreseeability); Mello v. Polish National Alliance, 446 Mass. 464 (2006) (proximate cause and foreseeability in negligence).

25. Massachusetts law recognizes that an owner’s failure to obey clear statutory or regulatory commands (such as leash laws) can be relevant evidence of negligence. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 288A (violation of statute as evidence of negligence) and pertinent Massachusetts authorities interpreting statutory violations as probative of negligence.

26. Plaintiff need not establish that the Dog actually bit her to prevail; where an owner’s negligence in controlling an animal causes a plaintiff to take evasive action resulting in injury, the owner may be liable for the foreseeable consequences of the owner’s breach. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 433 (liability for causing another to be endangered); applicable Massachusetts authorities regarding foreseeability and the scope of liability for negligent conduct.

(Notes: The authorities cited above are illustrative of the governing negligence principles in Massachusetts and the common law, including statutes and decisions addressing the duties of animal owners and the foreseeability/proximate cause analysis applied by Massachusetts courts.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant and award Plaintiff the following relief:

A. Damages for past medical expenses in the approximate sum of $3,500, and for past lost earnings in the approximate sum of $1,200;

B. Compensatory damages for past and future pain and suffering, physical impairment, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages, in an amount to be proven at trial;

C. Pre- and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;

D. Costs of suit, including reasonable filing fees and other litigation costs;

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
