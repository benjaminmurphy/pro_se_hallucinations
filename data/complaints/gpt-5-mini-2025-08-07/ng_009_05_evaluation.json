The opinion states that the \u201claw of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us.\u201d Using Palsgraf to show that causation was continuous and substantial is inaccurate and contrary to its reasoning, which turns on duty and foreseeability, not on superseding cause analysis.",

The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort.\u201d"
