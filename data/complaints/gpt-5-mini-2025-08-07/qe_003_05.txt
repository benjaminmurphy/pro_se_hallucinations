COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff, Alexandra Rivera, by and through undersigned counsel (or appearing pro se), brings this Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Alexandra Rivera (hereinafter “Plaintiff”) is an individual and tenant residing at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson (hereinafter “Defendant”) is the landlord and owner/lessor of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Premises”). Defendant may be served at the Premises.

3. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy of a studio apartment at the Premises beginning December 1, 2022, and continues as a tenant to date. Plaintiff pays rent of $1,200.00 per month to Defendant.

4. This action arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the Premises is located in Boston (Jamaica Plain) and the dispute concerns a residential lease and conditions at the Premises.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff leased a studio apartment at the Premises, commencing December 1, 2022. At the time Plaintiff viewed the apartment and entered into the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the interior ceiling in the living area and asked the Defendant about the stains.

6. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.” Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s representation and executed the lease.

7. In the first significant rainstorm after Plaintiff’s move-in, water began dripping through the ceiling in the same location as the previously-observed stain. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak and ongoing water intrusion.

8. Defendant repeatedly characterized the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and told Plaintiff that she had accepted an apartment with “character” when she signed the lease. Defendant did not timely or adequately repair the source of the leak.

9. The leak recurred and worsened over time. During one rainstorm the leak soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined a laptop that Plaintiff had left on a coffee table. Plaintiff replaced the laptop at an out-of-pocket cost of approximately $900.00.

10. The ongoing water intrusion has caused a persistent musty odor in the apartment and conditions consistent with mold growth. Plaintiff has experienced headaches and other health concerns she reasonably believes are related to mold and moisture in the Premises.

11. Because the leak and associated damage are concentrated in a portion of the studio, Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed and personal effects away from the affected area and is effectively living in only part of the apartment.

12. Plaintiff has made multiple written and oral complaints to Defendant about the leak, water damage, and resulting odors, and has demanded timely repair and remediation. Defendant has failed to perform timely, adequate repairs or to remediate the resulting mold and damage.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair and persistent water intrusion, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises, damage to personal property (including a laptop costing approximately $900.00), physical discomfort and headaches, and other consequential damages.

14. Plaintiff estimates total compensatory damages (for loss of use, diminution of value, emotional distress, inconvenience, and property damage) to be at least $2,100.00, consisting of: (a) $1,200.00 for loss of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises and related general damages; and (b) approximately $900.00 for the ruined laptop. Plaintiff seeks judgment for compensatory damages, costs, and interest, as set forth below.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment under Massachusetts Law)

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes to a tenant the covenant of quiet enjoyment — an implied promise that a tenant’s possession will not be substantially interfered with by the landlord’s actions or omissions, and that the tenant may have beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in residential leases and is breached where a landlord, by action or omission, substantially and unreasonably interferes with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

17. Defendant’s failure to repair recurring roof/ceiling leaks, failure to remediate the resulting moisture and probable mold conditions, Defendant’s minimization and dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaints, and Defendant’s ongoing allowance of repeated water intrusion into the living areas have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s peaceful and beneficial use and enjoyment of the Premises.

18. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in that Plaintiff has been denied the full use of her leased apartment, has been required to alter how and where she places her bed and belongings, has suffered loss of personal property, and has endured diminished habitability and associated health impacts.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered compensable damages, including without limitation: loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; diminution in rental value; replacement cost of ruined personal property (approximately $900.00); inconvenience and emotional distress; and other consequential damages in an amount to be determined by the Court but at least $2,100.00.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

A. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff for compensatory damages for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in an amount to be determined at trial and, at minimum, in the amount of $2,100.00 (itemized above), or in such other amount as the Court deems fair and just;

B. Interest on all monetary awards as allowed by law from the date of breach or as of the filing of this action;

C. Costs, statutory court filing fees, and reasonable disbursements incurred in this action;

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Date: December 1, 2025
