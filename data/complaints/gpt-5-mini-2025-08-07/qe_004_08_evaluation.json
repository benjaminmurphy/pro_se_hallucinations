Although it is not a Massachusetts case, it expressly cites and relies on the Massachusetts decision Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway as part of a national trend, making it strong persuasive authority on habitability, quiet enjoyment-related doctrines, and tenant remedies. Thus it fits within the proposition\u2019s reference to law in Massachusetts and persuasive authority on these topics.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We have concluded that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in this state and that the breach of such a warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. Under the implied warranty which we recognize, a residential landlord covenants that premises he leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. This implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that \u201cbare living requirements\u201d must be maintained."
