James Carter
   Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Laura Mitchell, residing in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Petitioner’s phone number is (617) 555-0123 and her email is psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent: James Carter, address unknown to Petitioner for purposes of this pleading but residing on Cape Cod in Barnstable County, Massachusetts.
1.3 Minor child: Sophie Carter, born in 2017 and currently age 8.
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law governing custody, including the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B) and related Massachusetts Probate and Family Court jurisdictional provisions. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the minor child presently attends school and resides primarily in Barnstable County and because the original custody order was entered in this Court.

2. Procedural History and Existing Order
2.1 On October 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody and parenting-time order (the “2019 Order”) awarding primary physical custody of the parties’ child to Petitioner (Laura Mitchell), with parenting time to Respondent consisting of every-other-weekend visits and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.
2.2 The parties have followed the 2019 Order until the material circumstances set forth below rendered the current midweek overnight and the attendant travel arrangements harmful to the child’s health, rest, and school performance.

3. Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 At the time the 2019 Order was entered, the parties lived in the same town, and the Wednesday overnight to Respondent’s home required only a brief (approximately five-minute) drive to school on Thursday morning.
3.2 Since entry of the 2019 Order, Respondent relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school and primary residence.
3.3 Respondent continues to exercise the midweek Wednesday overnight provided in the 2019 Order. Under Respondent’s current practice, he picks up Sophie from school on Wednesdays, drives her approximately ninety miles to his residence on Cape Cod, and then wakes her at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday to drive her back for school. These are multi-hour drives in both directions on a school night.
3.4 As a result of these extensive drives and early-morning return to school, Sophie is experiencing chronic fatigue. Petitioner has personal observations of Sophie’s exhaustion on Thursday mornings and decreased energy and participation in activities on Thursdays.
3.5 Sophie’s schoolteacher has reported that Sophie’s classroom participation and attention drop noticeably on Thursdays and that Sophie appears persistently tired on those days.
3.6 The change in Respondent’s residence and his continued insistence on maintaining the Wednesday overnight schedule are events and circumstances that occurred after entry of the 2019 Order and were not anticipated by the Court; they are substantial, material, and adverse to the child’s welfare and educational functioning.
3.7 Petitioner has attempted to address the issue directly with Respondent and to explore less disruptive arrangements, but Respondent insisted on continuing the longstanding schedule unchanged.

4. Legal Standard (General Statement)
4.1 Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and modification is warranted by the best interests of the child. The “best interests” inquiry focuses on the child’s physical, emotional, educational, and developmental needs and the effect of the current arrangement on those needs.
4.2 The facts set forth above demonstrate a material change (Respondent’s relocation approximately ninety miles away) and show that continuing the Wednesday overnight and the current weekend arrangement is detrimental to the child’s health and school functioning and therefore not in the child’s best interests.

5. Relief Requested
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order modifying the 2019 Order as follows:
5.1 Eliminate the midweek Wednesday overnight currently awarded to Respondent, and replace that time with either (a) a non-overnight midweek visit in the Barnstable area that does not require early-morning travel for school; or (b) additional non-school-night parenting time on weekends closer in time to the scheduled alternate-weekend visits, as the Court deems appropriate and in Sophie’s best interests.
5.2 Modify Respondent’s weekend parenting-time schedule as necessary to avoid lengthy school-night travel that materially interferes with Sophie’s health and educational performance. For example, the Court might schedule weekend exchanges and returns so that long-distance travel does not fall on a school night or otherwise require Sophie to be awakened in the pre-dawn hours for school attendance.
5.3 Require that any long-distance exchanges be conducted at a mutually agreed, reasonably convenient location in Barnstable County, or in the alternative, require that long-distance travel not occur on school nights and that Sophie have adequate overnight rest prior to school attendance.
5.4 Grant any and all other relief the Court deems appropriate and necessary to protect the child’s health, education, and welfare, including temporary relief to avoid further harm pending final adjudication.

6. Basis for Relief
6.1 Petitioner alleges the following bases for this modification request:
   a. Respondent’s relocation since entry of the 2019 Order constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not anticipated by the Court.
   b. The current midweek overnight arrangement, as currently exercised by Respondent, causes multi-hour round-trip travel on school nights and early-morning wakeups that have resulted in persistent exhaustion and decreased school participation for the child.
   c. Continuation of the existing order, without modification, is detrimental to the child’s physical and educational well-being and thus is not in the child’s best interests.
   d. Modification of the current order to remove the midweek overnight and to adjust weekend exchanges is necessary to align the parenting-time schedule with Sophie’s best interests and to prevent ongoing harm.

7. Temporary Relief Requested
7.1 Pending final hearing and order, Petitioner requests that the Court grant temporary relief to prevent further harm to the child, including, but not limited to:
   a. Immediate suspension of the midweek Wednesday overnight pending hearing; or
   b. Immediate temporary modification to require that any midweek visit be a non-overnight visit or occur at a location that does not necessitate long-distance travel or early-morning return for school; and/or
   c. Any other temporary measures the Court deems necessary to protect the child.

8. Certification and Prayer for Relief
8.1 Petitioner believes, on information and belief, that the allegations herein are true and that modification is necessary to safeguard the child’s health and education.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
   a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the October 15, 2019 custody order;
   b. Modify the 2019 Order by eliminating Respondent’s midweek Wednesday overnight and by adjusting the parenting-time schedule (including weekends) as set forth above or as otherwise determined by the Court to be in Sophie’s best interests;
   c. Grant temporary relief as necessary pending final hearing to prevent further harm to the child;
   d. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

Laura Mitchell

Notes and Important Information for the Court and Counsel
- The factual allegations above (relocation of Respondent to Cape Cod approximately 90 miles from the child’s school; the ongoing Wednesday overnight involving long-distance travel with early-morning returns; the child’s exhaustion and decreased classroom participation on Thursdays) form the core basis for finding a material change in circumstances and demonstrating that continued enforcement of the midweek overnight is not in the child’s best interests.
- Petitioner respectfully requests prompt scheduling of a temporary hearing to address the midweek overnight pending final determination given the immediate effect on the child’s sleep and school performance.

Legal Authorities (General Statement)
- Petitioner intends to rely upon Massachusetts statutory and decisional law establishing (1) the standards for jurisdiction in child custody matters (including the Massachusetts enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B)), (2) the requirement that a party seeking modification demonstrate a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior custody order, and (3) the governing criterion that the child’s best interests control in any custody or parenting-time determination.
- Petitioner will present and cite the appropriate Massachusetts statutes and controlling Massachusetts cases addressing modification of custody and parenting-time orders and the best interest standard at or before the hearing.
