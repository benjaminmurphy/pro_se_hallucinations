      "support_reasoning": "Troxel concerns the constitutional limits on state interference with a fit parent\u2019s decisions in the context of nonparent (grandparent) visitation. The opinion repeatedly criticizes Washington\u2019s statute for using a bare \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard without giving special weight to the parent\u2019s decision, and it explicitly declines to define the constitutional standard for such cases. It does not hold that courts should or do evaluate \u2018modification requests\u2019 (or visitation requests generally) under a generic best\u2011interests standard; if anything, it questions reliance on that standard alone in this context.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe Washington nonparental visitation statute is breathtakingly broad. According to the statute's text, \u2018[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time,\u2019 and the court may grant such visitation rights whenever \u2018visitation may serve the best interest of the child.\u2019 \u2026 Once the visitation petition has been filed in court \u2026 \u00a7 26.10.160(3) contains no requirement that a court accord the parent's decision any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever. Instead, the Washington statute places the best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge.\u201d"

Santosky, however, deals specifically with the due process standard of proof (clear and convincing evidence) required for state-initiated termination of parental rights, not visitation modification or exposure to violent third parties.
