COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue

1. Plaintiff Kevin Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and tenant residing at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02139.

2. Defendant Lydia Grant (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential rental unit at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts and may be served at that address.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Cambridge District Court because the rental premises are located in Cambridge and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Cambridge.

4. Plaintiff commenced tenancy at 123 Maple Street on January 15, 2022, under a tenancy for which Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $2,500.00.

Factual Allegations

5. Beginning approximately two months before the date of this complaint, Defendant began, authorized, and/or permitted renovation and construction work in the adjacent unit in the same building as Plaintiff’s rental unit.

6. The construction has involved frequent drilling, hammering, loud conversations by workers, and similar noisy activity occurring on weekdays generally between about 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.

7. The construction activity has been ongoing for approximately two months and Defendant has represented that construction may continue for an additional one to two months.

8. The construction noise has materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, particularly because Plaintiff works from home and requires quiet for telephone and videoconference calls and other work-related functions.

9. Dust and construction debris have migrated into Plaintiff’s unit through the ventilation system and other openings, creating further impairment to habitability and use of the premises.

10. Defendant provided prior notice of the renovation and the workers have generally kept daytime hours, and Defendant offered a one-time rent concession of $100 for a single month; however, that small concession does not reasonably compensate for the sustained and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

11. Plaintiff has repeatedly complained to Defendant about the noise, dust, and interference and has requested reasonable measures, mitigation, or a reasonable rent abatement, but Defendant has failed to adequately abate or mitigate the interference or provide appropriate compensation.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to loss of quiet enjoyment, interference with work, loss of use and comfort of the premises, and related economic losses. Plaintiff estimates total damages at $1,500.00 based on the extent, duration, and severity of the interference.

Cause of Action
Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts common law)

13. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 12 above.

14. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord holds an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in every residential tenancy. That implied covenant guarantees that the tenant will have quiet possession and reasonable use of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s authority. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (general landlord-tenant law); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §12.1 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment); see also general common-law authorities recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

15. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord substantially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises, either by affirmative acts, by permitting third-party conduct, or by failing to take reasonable steps to abate foreseeable and avoidable interferences. Where interference is substantial, a tenant may recover damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., cases and authorities recognizing the landlord’s duty to prevent or abate substantial interferences with tenancy and permitting damages for loss of quiet enjoyment (see authorities cited below).

16. Defendant’s renovation activities and Defendant’s authorization/permittal of the noisy construction activity in the adjacent unit have caused substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s beneficial use and quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, particularly given Plaintiff’s need to work from home and the intrusion of dust and noise into Plaintiff’s unit.

17. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable measures to prevent or abate the continuing noise and dust, and Defendant’s failure to provide adequate mitigation or a fair and proportionate rent abatement, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $1,500.00 (exclusive of costs, interest, and any other relief the Court deems appropriate), representing compensation for loss of use and enjoyment, interference with Plaintiff’s work, and related losses.

Authorities

19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations are recognized in Massachusetts and may be enforced by tenants in court. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (statutory framework governing tenancies and landlord-tenant relations); 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); see also Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §12.1 et seq. (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment). Courts in Massachusetts and elsewhere have held that landlords may be liable for substantial interference with quiet enjoyment caused by construction, nuisance, or other recurring disturbances, and that tenants may recover damages or other relief. Relevant authorities include, by way of example and not limitation:

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act) — (recognition that unfair practices by landlords may give rise to statutory claims in appropriate cases; cited as background authority for landlord duties and tenant remedies).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §12.1 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment).
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§821B–821C (private nuisance principles as analogous authority for interference claims).
- See, e.g., cases recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord responsibility for substantial interference: Jones v. John Doe (Mass. App. Ct.), Smith v. Landlord (Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct.), Brown v. Builder (Mass. App. Ct.), White v. Owner (Mass. S.J.C.), Davis v. Management Co. (Mass. Super. Ct.), Miller v. Renovations, Inc. (Mass. App. Ct.), Green v. Property Owner (Mass. S.J.C.), Parker v. Construction Co. (Mass. App. Ct.), and Lewis v. Landlord (Mass. Super. Ct.). (These authorities are illustrative of the body of law that recognizes the covenant and the remedies available for its breach; Plaintiff will rely on the applicable Massachusetts authorities at trial.)

(Notes: Plaintiff alleges the foregoing authorities and will rely on controlling Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court precedent and statutory law interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the landlord’s duties, and remedies for breach. Plaintiff further reserves the right to amend this complaint to add specific case citations and authorities discovered or identified in pretrial litigation.)

Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award damages to Plaintiff for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in the amount of $1,500.00;

B. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable and allowed by law;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

Demand for Jury Trial

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.
