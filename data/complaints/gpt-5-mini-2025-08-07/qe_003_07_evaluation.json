      "support_reasoning": "The case is a Vermont Supreme Court decision, not a Massachusetts case, and it concerns the implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, not an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. While it briefly cites Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway (a Massachusetts case) for the contractual view of residential leases and mutual covenants, Hilder itself does not articulate or apply a Massachusetts common-law rule about a covenant of quiet enjoyment or landlord conduct that substantially interferes with use and enjoyment. Thus, it does not provide direct authority for the specific Massachusetts quiet-enjoyment proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Therefore, we now hold expressly that in the rental of any residential dwelling unit an implied warranty exists in the lease, whether oral or written, that the landlord will deliver over and maintain, throughout the period of the tenancy, premises that are safe, clean and fit for human habitation. This warranty of habitability is implied in tenancies for a specific period or at will. Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199, 293 N.E.2d 831, 843 (1973)."

It does not discuss landlord-tenant law, leases, or the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nor does it address when a landlord\u2019s actions or omissions render premises unsuitable for use. Therefore it cannot serve as authority for the stated proposition about breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In this court, petitioners urge that the Secretary\u2019s order refusing to publish their proposal should be reversed on two grounds. First, they argue that their petition, properly interpreted, met all the statutory requirements, including that of \u201cpracticability.\u201d Second, they urge that the 1958 amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires the Secretary to ban any food additive which is found to induce cancer in experimental animals (the Delaney amendment), must be read to require the Secretary not merely to publish their proposal but to establish the \u201czero tolerance\u201d forthwith."

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The court expressly ties the landlord\u2019s obligations to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction doctrine, describing that a landlord\u2019s acts or omissions that render premises unfit for their purposes or deprive the tenant of basic services violate the tenant\u2019s beneficial enjoyment. It then formalizes this into an implied warranty of habitability, breached where \u201cbare living requirements\u201d are not met and substantial defects materially affect health and safety\u2014i.e., where the premises are substantially unsuitable for their intended residential use or substantially interfere with use and enjoyment. This squarely matches the proposition\u2019s formulation.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In the century since the statutes were first enacted, for example, California courts have evolved the \u201cconstructive eviction\u201d doctrine as a common law remedy completely independent of this statutory framework; under the modern constructive eviction decisions, a tenant\u2019s right to terminate his lease has not been measured by the standards of sections 1941 or 1942, but by the developing standard that permits abandonment whenever a landlord\u2019s \u201cacts or omissions [render the premises] unfit for the purposes for which they were leased.\u201d (Groh v. Kover\u2019s Bull Pen, Inc. (1963) 221 Cal.App.2d 611, 614 [34 Cal.Rptr. 637] ...). \u2026 Under the implied warranty which we recognize, a residential landlord covenants that premises he leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. \u2026 it does mean that \u201cbare living requirements\u201d must be maintained. In most cases substantial compliance with those applicable building and housing code standards which materially affect health and safety will suffice to meet the landlord\u2019s obligations."

It explicitly links these duties to tenant protection and cites Javins and Kendall in terms of habitability, landlord obligations, and tenant remedies.
