I can draft a clear, professional complaint for you based on the facts you gave. I must be upfront: I will not fabricate or invent case law or statutory citations. Where I can cite accurate, well-known Massachusetts statutes and the State Sanitary Code I will do so; I will not invent Massachusetts cases or incorrect statute numbers. If you want a complaint that includes specific Massachusetts cases (names and exact citations), I recommend that an attorney or legal researcher add those precise case citations before filing. Below I have prepared a full, court-ready complaint with all required sections, factual allegations, a single cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and a prayer for relief. Where possible I cite applicable Massachusetts statutory authority and the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code. Please review carefully for accuracy and consider having a lawyer or the court clerk review the form before filing.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT

Jessica Wallis,
Plaintiff

v.                                              Civil Action No. ___________

Mark Thompson,
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Jessica Wallis is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and resides at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.
2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, and may be served at such address.
3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a lease for the dwelling unit located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA; Plaintiff commenced occupancy on May 1, 2021 and has paid monthly rent of $2,300.
4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Cambridge District Court because the property that is the subject of this action is located in Cambridge and the events giving rise to this claim occurred there. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and local venue provisions) and general venue rules for civil actions in district court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Beginning in approximately early October 2025 (roughly two months prior to the date of filing), Defendant began renovating the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment in the same building.
6. The renovation work has involved regular daytime construction activity—drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers—that typically occurs weekdays from about 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
7. Plaintiff works primarily from home and relies on a reasonably quiet indoor environment to participate in and conduct telephonic and videoconference business calls and other work-related tasks. The construction activity has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to work and to use her home for normal residential purposes.
8. The construction has continued daily for approximately two months and Defendant has informed Plaintiff the renovation may continue for an additional one to two months.
9. Dust and debris generated by the renovation enters Plaintiff’s unit through ventilation pathways and has required Plaintiff to clean more frequently and has raised concerns about indoor air quality and living conditions.
10. Prior to the start of construction, Defendant provided Plaintiff notice that renovation would occur and the workers have generally limited their work to daytime hours. Defendant has not, however, taken steps sufficient to prevent noise or dust from materially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment nor offered relocation or an alternative solution that would mitigate the ongoing disruption.
11. Plaintiff communicated to Defendant that the level and duration of noise and dust constituted a substantial disruption to her quiet enjoyment of the premises and requested additional relief. In response, Defendant offered a single one-time rent reduction of $100 for one month.
12. The $100 concession is insufficient to compensate Plaintiff for the loss of quiet use of her apartment, the disruption to her employment and work-from-home activities, the intrusion of dust into her unit, and the reduction in the habitability and enjoyment of the premises during the renovation period.
13. As a proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment of the premises, diminished habitability and comfort, interference with work and income-producing activity, and time and expense associated with additional cleaning and mitigation of dust. Plaintiff estimates damages in the amount of $500 for the disruption described herein and reserves the right to amend this amount if additional harms are documented.

LEGAL BACKGROUND AND AUTHORITY (GENERAL)
14. Under Massachusetts law, a residential lease carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment: a tenant is entitled to use and enjoy the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or persons acting under the landlord’s authority. The covenant may be breached by substantial, unreasonable and ongoing interferences with the tenant’s use of the premises even if the landlord did not intend to interfere and even if the landlord provided notice of planned activity, where the interference is sufficiently severe or prolonged.
15. The State Sanitary Code sets minimum standards for housing and indoor air quality and requires that residential housing be maintained in a manner that does not create health and safety hazards. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
16. Summary process and other landlord-tenant remedies are governed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 and related statutes. Other Massachusetts landlord-tenant provisions (including statutory protections related to security deposits and certain landlord duties) are set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (see, e.g., provisions addressing landlord duties and tenant remedies generally).
17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is recognized by Massachusetts courts as a contractual and possessory protection for tenants and is enforceable by civil action for damages and other appropriate relief where a landlord’s actions or omissions substantially deprive the tenant of the beneficial use of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts common law)
18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.
19. Plaintiff holds a residential leasehold and right of possession of the premises located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA.
20. Defendant, as landlord and owner of the premises and as the party responsible for the renovation work in the adjacent unit, owed to Plaintiff the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
21. Defendant materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment by permitting, authorizing, and failing to abate or reasonably mitigate prolonged substantial construction-related noise (drilling, hammering, and loud worker conversations during weekday work hours for an extended period) and by permitting dust from the renovation to enter Plaintiff’s unit.
22. Defendant’s actions and omissions caused ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use the premises for ordinary residential purposes and for Plaintiff’s employment-related activities that require a reasonably quiet environment, resulting in actual damages to Plaintiff.
23. Defendant’s offer of a limited, one-time rent reduction of $100 for one month does not fully compensate Plaintiff for the ongoing substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment of her apartment and the other harms described above.
24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered compensable damages in an amount to be determined at trial but which Plaintiff currently estimates at $500 and which may be amended to reflect additional documented harm.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:
A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $500;
B. Award Plaintiff costs and disbursements incurred in this action, including filing fees and service costs;
C. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;
D. Order any equitable relief the Court finds appropriate to abate the ongoing interference and to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment (including an order directing Defendant to take reasonable measures to abate dust and reduce noise intrusion, or other measures as the Court deems just and proper);
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

NOTES AND NEXT STEPS
- Before filing, confirm the correct caption format and any local court filing requirements with the Cambridge District Court clerk. The Court clerk can confirm the civil action number, filing fees, required copies, and how to effect service on Defendant.
- If you want me to add specific Massachusetts case citations (reported SJC or Appeals Court decisions discussing the covenant of quiet enjoyment), I can prepare a list of commonly-cited Massachusetts authorities, but I will need to confirm and provide only accurate case names and citations. A legal researcher or attorney can insert those citations in the complaint where paragraph 14 et seq. discuss the legal background. (I will not invent or guess case citations.)
- Consider documenting the interference: keep a calendar of noisy dates/times, audio or video recordings (subject to state law), photos of dust accumulation, written communications with Defendant, and copies of the rent payment history and the $100 concession offer. Those exhibits can be attached to the complaint at filing or used as evidence later.
- If you would like, I can prepare a proposed summons, an affidavit of service template, and suggested exhibit labels (e.g., Exhibit A – Copy of Lease; Exhibit B – Email from Defendant notifying Plaintiff of renovation; Exhibit C – Photos; Exhibit D – Rent ledger; Exhibit E – Written offer of $100 concession).

If you want me to proceed to add a list of specific Massachusetts cases and exact statutory citations that are commonly used with quiet enjoyment claims, I can do so, but I will only include citations I can verify as accurate — and I will state which citations I am certain of and which should be checked by counsel or a legal researcher. Please let me know whether you want me to prepare that verified list and incorporate it into the complaint.
