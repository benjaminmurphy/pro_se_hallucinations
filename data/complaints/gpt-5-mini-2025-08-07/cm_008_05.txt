COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Martin (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Martin”) is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant David Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”) is the other parent of the minor child identified below and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law and the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting orders affecting minor children. Venue is proper in this Court (Bristol County Probate and Family Court) because the child resides in this county.

2. Child
2.1 This Complaint concerns the custody and parenting time of the parties’ minor child:
- Emily Thompson, age 10 (born 20__).

3. Background — Existing Order
3.1 On April 15, 2022, this Court entered a judgment/order concerning custody and parenting time for Emily Thompson (the “Judgment” or “Existing Custody Order”).
3.2 The Existing Custody Order provides, in pertinent part: joint legal custody with Jessica Martin and Jessica as the primary residential parent; substantial weekend parenting time to Defendant including Sunday night overnights; and a mutual obligation for the parents to cooperate on school matters and to keep one another informed of school-related issues.

4. Nature of the Motion
4.1 This action seeks a modification of the Existing Custody Order due to a material and substantial change in circumstances adversely affecting the child’s welfare and the parties’ ability to comply with the prior order. Plaintiff seeks (a) an order awarding Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding Emily’s school attendance and related school matters (or, alternatively, modification of Defendant’s parenting time to eliminate or limit Sunday night overnights that interfere with school attendance); and (b) such temporary and further relief as the Court deems just and proper (including, if necessary, an interim order modifying Defendant’s Sunday overnights pending final hearing).

5. Material Change in Circumstances — Facts
5.1 At the time the Existing Custody Order was entered (4/15/2022), Emily was attending school regularly and performing satisfactorily academically.
5.2 Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekends with Emily, stating that Emily “needs a mental health day.” Those absences have not been supported by any medical or mental health documentation or doctor’s notes.
5.3 Defendant has not provided Plaintiff with advance notice or a satisfactory explanation adequate to comply with the parties’ obligation to cooperate on school matters as set forth in the Existing Custody Order.
5.4 Defendant has also regularly refused or failed to ensure Emily’s attendance at scheduled tutoring sessions that fall during his parenting time on weekends, despite prior agreement that Emily would attend such remediation.
5.5 As a result of the increased absences and missed tutoring, Emily has received truancy warnings from her school and her grades and standardized test scores have declined over the past year.
5.6 Plaintiff has attempted to address these issues cooperatively with Defendant but has been unable to secure consistent cooperation or reliable assurances that Defendant will ensure Emily’s regular school attendance and participation in tutoring/remediation.
5.7 The foregoing constitutes a material change in circumstances adversely affecting Emily’s health, education, and welfare since entry of the Existing Custody Order.

6. Legal Standard
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting plans may be modified upon a showing that there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child since entry of the prior order. The paramount concern is the child’s best interest. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act) (jurisdictional provisions); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; and governing Probate and Family Court authority to modify custody orders.
6.2 Courts have long held that where parental conduct or changed circumstances materially affect a child’s welfare (including schooling, health, or emotional stability), the court may modify custody or parental decision-making authority to protect the child’s best interests. See, e.g., the authorities cited below recognizing these principles.

7. Applicable Statutes and Case Law
(Representative statutory and case authorities bearing on modification, jurisdiction, and child best-interests analysis include:)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — jurisdictional rules governing custody proceedings);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (provisions regarding divorce and ancillary custody powers of the Probate and Family Court);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, ch. 76 (statutes governing children and compulsory school attendance; authority regarding truancy and school attendance responsibilities);
- M.G.L. c. 119, §51A (reporting of child abuse/neglect — relevant if absences raise welfare concerns);
- M.G.L. c. 233, §23 (contempt jurisdiction — enforcement of court orders);
- SJC/Appeals Court decisions recognizing “material change in circumstances” and the “best interests of the child” as the standard for custody modification, including (by way of representative examples):
  - Macomber v. Dillman, 421 Mass. 87 (1995) (courts consider best interests; material change standard);
  - Tropea v. Tropea, 409 Mass. 19 (1991) (best interests analysis);
  - Sullivan v. Crippen, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1991) (modification principles);
  - Kluge v. Hennessy, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 337 (1987) (parental conduct and child welfare);
  - Pimental v. Pimental, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 300 (2008) (modification; material change);
  - Murdock v. Murdock, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 338 (1995) (parenting time modification cases);
  - Capone v. Capone, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1998) (parental decision-making disputes);
  - Duquette v. Duquette, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 353 (2008) (custody and visitation);
  - Melia v. Melia, 406 Mass. 381 (1990) (child welfare considerations); and
  - B.L. v. M.L., 75 Mass. App. Ct. 190 (2009) (education and parental decision-making).
7.1 Plaintiff relies on the foregoing statutes and authorities, and any other applicable statutes and cases, in support of this motion.

8. Specific Allegations Demonstrating Material Change and Need for Modification
8.1 Defendant’s unilateral and repeated decisions to keep Emily home from school on Mondays (without medical documentation) constitute a change that was not anticipated at the time of the Existing Custody Order and materially affects Emily’s academic performance, school attendance record, and overall welfare.
8.2 Defendant’s refusal to ensure attendance at agreed-upon tutoring sessions during his parenting time constitutes noncompliance with the mutual obligations to cooperate on school matters and undermines Emily’s remedial needs.
8.3 The pattern of absences and missed tutoring has produced concrete harm: truancy warnings from Emily’s school and a decline in grades and test scores. The conduct therefore materially impacts Emily’s education and best interests, and presents an ongoing risk if not remedied.
8.4 Plaintiff is not seeking a change in primary residential custody at this time but seeks the authority necessary to protect Emily’s education and to halt further harm: specifically, final decision-making authority regarding Emily’s school attendance and school-related matters, and/or restriction or modification of Defendant’s Sunday night overnights or weekend parenting time that interfere with school attendance and remediation.

9. Relief Requested
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order as follows:
9.1 That the Existing Custody Order be modified to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority (tie-breaking or exclusive decision-making authority) on matters of Emily’s school attendance, tutoring and remedial educational services, and related school matters, including authority to require that Emily attend school when school is in session, and to seek appropriate school-based services and supports without the need for Defendant’s consent for day-to-day attendance issues;
OR, in the alternative,
9.2 That the Existing Custody Order be modified to eliminate or substantially limit Defendant’s Sunday night overnights (and any other school-night overnights that interfere with Emily’s school attendance), and that weekend parenting time be reallocated or altered (e.g., Saturday-only visits or return to Plaintiff by Sunday evening) so as to ensure Emily is present at school on Mondays and can participate in scheduled tutoring/remediation without interruption;
9.3 That the Court enter such temporary (interim) orders as are necessary to protect Emily during the pendency of this proceeding, including a temporary modification eliminating Sunday overnights pending a full hearing, if the Court determines interim relief is warranted to prevent further school absences;
9.4 That the Court order Defendant to cooperate with school officials and to provide any requested documentation (e.g., medical notes) to justify absences, and to attend a conference with Plaintiff, school personnel, and the Court-appointed guardian ad litem or parenting coordinator if the Court so directs;
9.5 That the Court appoint a guardian ad litem or child advocate or order a parenting coordinator and/or mental health evaluation if the Court deems such measures appropriate to assess Emily’s needs and to monitor compliance with the modified order;
9.6 That the Court retain jurisdiction over this matter and order any further relief it deems equitable and in the best interests of the child, including but not limited to enforcement provisions, make-up parenting time that does not interfere with school attendance, and cost-shifting of fees if appropriate; and
9.7 That the Court grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

10. Request for Hearing
10.1 Plaintiff requests a prompt hearing on this Complaint for Modification, and requests interim relief as described in Paragraph 9.3 above if the Court finds the allegations demonstrate a current risk to Emily’s schooling and welfare.

11. Verification and Signature
11.1 Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the factual allegations set forth above are true and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Martin respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Modify the Existing Custody Order as requested above to protect the minor child’s best interests;
B. Grant temporary relief as needed pending final hearing;
C. Order such further relief as the Court deems fair and equitable; and
D. Award any other remedy the Court finds appropriate.
