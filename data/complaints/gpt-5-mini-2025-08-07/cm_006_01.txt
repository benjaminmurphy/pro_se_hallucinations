Jennifer Collins
     Plaintiff

v.

Mark Richards
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Jennifer Collins ("Plaintiff" or "Jennifer") is an individual residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Mark Richards ("Defendant" or "Mark") is the father of the children named below and is a party to the original custody order entered in this Court.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s authority to enter and modify custody orders. Venue is proper in this Court because the minor children reside in Worcester County and the original order was entered in this Court.

2. Children
2.1 The minor children who are the subject of this action are:
- Emily Richards, born 2017 (age 8);
- Jacob Richards, born 2019 (age 6).

3. Existing Order
3.1 A custody order concerning the children was entered on May 15, 2021 (the "Existing Order"). Under that order, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the children. Defendant is allowed alternating weekends and one midweek visit.
3.2 The Existing Order does not contain provisions regarding the presence of new romantic partners, third parties, or cohabitants in the Defendant’s home while the children are present.

4. Material Change in Circumstances — Statement of Facts
4.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the children’s welfare and safety.
4.2 Defendant now resides with an adult romantic partner/cohabitant ("the Cohabitant") who, Plaintiff understands and alleges, has a criminal history that includes an assault and battery conviction and who was the subject of a civil abuse prevention (restraining) order issued by another court based on allegations of intimate partner assault.
4.3 The children have reported to Plaintiff that the Cohabitant frequently yells in the presence of the children and slams doors loudly during arguments. The children have expressed fear about the loud arguments and about the behavior of the Cohabitant.
4.4 On one occasion described by the children, the Cohabitant grabbed one of the children (Emily or Jacob) with enough force to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm.
4.5 A next-door neighbor called the police during a loud argument at Defendant’s residence on a day when the children were present; police responded to the residence and documented the disturbance.
4.6 Plaintiff has reasonable concern, based on the children’s statements, the police response, and the Cohabitant’s known criminal history and prior restraining order, that continued unsupervised visitation in Defendant’s home, where the Cohabitant is present, poses a risk to the children's physical and emotional safety and is contrary to the best interests of the children.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Under Massachusetts law, a court may modify an existing custody order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and upon a determination that modification is in the best interests of the child. The best interests standard requires that the Court consider the safety, welfare, and developmental needs of the child and weigh all relevant factors bearing on the child’s well-being.
5.2 Plaintiff alleges that the circumstances described above constitute a material change in circumstances since the Existing Order was entered and that modification is necessary to protect the children’s physical safety and emotional welfare and to serve their best interests.

6. Causes of Action / Request for Relief
Count I — Modification of Custody/Parenting Time on Basis of Material Change in Circumstances
6.1 Plaintiff hereby incorporates paragraphs 1–5 above as if set forth fully herein.
6.2 Defendant’s cohabitation with a person who has a history of assaultive conduct, a prior restraining order, and the documented incidents of loud and threatening behavior and at least one physically aggressive act toward a child are material and substantial changes in circumstances warranting modification of the Existing Order.
6.3 The presence of the Cohabitant during Defendant’s visitation with the children constitutes a present and continuing risk to the children's safety and welfare and is contrary to the best interests of the children.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
A. Modify the Existing Order to prohibit the presence of Defendant’s current cohabitant (or any person with an assaultive criminal history or prior abuse prevention order) in the home or at any location where the children are to be during Defendant’s parenting time, unless approved in advance by the Court;
B. Alternatively, require that all parenting time between Defendant and the children that occurs in the presence of the Cohabitant be supervised by a mutually agreeable and Court-approved professional supervisor (or, in default of agreement, a supervisor appointed by the Court and funded as the Court deems appropriate);
C. In the further alternative, convert Defendant’s alternating weekend and midweek visits to supervised visitation only until such time as the Court is satisfied, after hearing or further evidence, that the children can safely be placed in Defendant’s unsupervised care and that the Cohabitant will not be present or pose a risk to the children;
D. Direct that the Court make any investigative inquiries it deems appropriate, including an order for a 51A report and/or inquiry by the Department of Children and Families if the Court deems such action warranted, and that the Court may order any psychological evaluation or home study it deems necessary to determine the safety of the children during Defendant’s visits;
E. Order that exchanges of the children occur in a neutral, public, and safe location or under supervised exchange conditions until further order of the Court;
F. Order that Defendant and any adult involved with the children undergo appropriate parenting and anger-management or domestic-violence-related counseling or education as the Court deems appropriate;
G. Award any such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs, fees, and such temporary relief as may be necessary to protect the children during the pendency of this action.

7. Notice and Request for Hearing
7.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule this matter for an expedited hearing on temporary and permanent modification so that the Court may consider issuing temporary protections for the children pending a full hearing on the merits.

8. Certification and Signature
I hereby certify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the factual allegations made above are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Plaintiff relies upon the statutes, rules, and caselaw addressing the Court’s authority to protect the safety and welfare of children and to modify custody upon a material change in circumstances.

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. L. ch. 208 (statutes governing divorce, custody jurisdiction and related relief, and the Probate and Family Court’s authority over custody matters).

- Mass. Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure and Probate & Family Court rules (governing filings, temporary relief, custody hearings, and discovery).
- Mass. Gen. L. ch. 215 (procedural provisions applicable to certain family court matters), and any other statutory provisions the Court deems applicable to custody modification and the safety of children.

Leading and Relevant Authorities on Custody Modification and Best Interests (examples)
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (United States Supreme Court recognition of parental rights and consideration of best interests in custody matters).
- Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing modification of custody for material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child (see, e.g., cases recognizing the material-change standard and the primacy of child safety and welfare in custody modifications).
- Authorities addressing the relevance of domestic violence, criminal history, and the presence of third parties in custody determinations (Mass. cases construing the impact of abuse or risk of harm on custody and visitation).
- Authorities recognizing the Court’s authority to order supervised visitation, temporary protective measures, evaluations, and investigations (including 51A inquiries and psychological evaluations) when children’s safety is at risk.

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court consider the allegations and the authorities cited above in determining whether the Existing Order should be modified to protect the safety and welfare of Emily and Jacob Richards.
