COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Ramirez (“Plaintiff”), by way of Complaint against Defendant Mark Wilson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is an individual and a residential tenant residing at 45 Washington Ave, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant is the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, and is the party to whom Plaintiff pays rent.

3. Plaintiff began renting the apartment on or about June 1, 2022, pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy for which Plaintiff pays $1,500.00 per month.

4. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law because the subject premises and the events giving rise to this action are located in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Chelsea District Court.

5. Venue is proper in this Court because the premises are located in Chelsea and the acts complained of occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. The Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. At all times relevant, Defendant had possession and control of the building’s common areas and maintained responsibility for reasonable security and repair of common entrances and locks, including the main entry door to the building.

8. For at least two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the main entry door to the building has had a broken lock and does not latch properly; the door can be pushed open without unlocking and thereby permits unauthorized access to the building.

9. On or about October 1, 2025 (approximately two months ago), Plaintiff notified Defendant of the broken main entry door lock and requested repair. Defendant acknowledged the problem and stated he would fix the lock.

10. Defendant failed to make repairs. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the need to repair the lock on two separate occasions since the initial notice, but Defendant did not arrange or complete repair of the main entry door lock.

11. On or about November __, 2025 (last month), an unknown person entered the building through the unsecured main entry and went through mail/packages left in the common hallway. Several residents, including Plaintiff, had packages taken from the hallway.

12. Plaintiff’s package, containing goods of approximately $120.00 in value, was stolen from the hallway.

13. At or about the same time, Plaintiff began observing evidence that someone had been sleeping in the building basement — personal items and bedding — causing Plaintiff to reasonably fear for personal safety and security in the premises.

14. Because Defendant did not secure or repair the main entry door and did not otherwise take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized entry after notice, Plaintiff reasonably believed the Defendant had failed to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

15. In response to Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff purchased a security camera directed at her individual apartment door and installed a new, better deadbolt on her apartment door, at a personal cost of approximately $200.00.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair the main entry door lock and otherwise secure the building after being notified of the dangerous condition, Plaintiff suffered monetary damages including, but not limited to, the loss of her package ($120.00) and out-of-pocket cost for the upgraded deadbolt and security camera ($200.00), totaling $320.00, as well as emotional distress, annoyance, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law; Massachusetts)

17. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–16 as if set forth fully herein.

18. Under Massachusetts law, a tenant has an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in a leasehold, which imposes on the landlord an obligation not to substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, either by the landlord’s own acts or by the landlord’s deliberate or negligent failure to prevent third-party intrusions when the landlord has control over the premises and has been given notice of hazardous conditions. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §12.1 (implied covenant); see also Massachusetts authority recognizing the landlord’s duty to refrain from substantially interfering with a tenant’s possession and enjoyment (common law quiet enjoyment principles).

19. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially and materially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Where a landlord is aware of a dangerous condition in the property’s common areas and fails to remedy it within a reasonable time, the landlord may be liable for resulting harm and damages to tenants. See, e.g., Massachusetts decisions and landlord–tenant law applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment to failures to secure common areas and prevent foreseeable intrusions by third parties.

20. Defendant knew or should have known of the broken main entry door lock, because Plaintiff provided specific notice of the problem and requested repair. Defendant represented he would fix the problem but failed to do so.

21. Defendant’s failure to repair the door lock and otherwise secure the building after being notified allowed unauthorized persons to enter the building, resulting in theft of Plaintiff’s package and evidence of persons sleeping in the basement, and thereby substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and use of the premises.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered compensable damages in the amount of approximately $320.00 for replacement of stolen property and for the out-of-pocket cost of security measures necessitated by Defendant’s failure to act, together with costs and interest, and such other damages as the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW, STATUTES AND AUTHORITY

23. The Plaintiff relies upon and cites the following authorities as illustrative of the governing principles of Massachusetts landlord–tenant law and the covenant of quiet enjoyment (these authorities are cited here for legal context and support for the claim; Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement or amend authorities as appropriate during litigation):

   Statutes and Regulations
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (general landlord-tenant provisions)
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §14 (relating to possession and rights under tenancy)*
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §18 (landlord obligations and rights)*
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §127A (health and sanitary code enforcement by boards of health)
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (consumer protection statute; declaratory context)
   - Mass. Code Regs. (State Sanitary Code), 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and landlord-tenant procedural provisions)

   Treatises/Restatement
   - Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §12.1 (Implied covenant of quiet enjoyment)

   Cases (illustrative Massachusetts authority on quiet enjoyment, landlord duties, and related landlord-tenant principles)
   - [See Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord duties to repair and secure premises, and the availability of damages for interference with possession and enjoyment; the Plaintiff will rely on applicable SJC and Appeals Court precedents, including decisions that hold landlords responsible where notice and control exist, and that tenants may recover damages for breach of quiet enjoyment.]

   (Plaintiff will identify and rely on controlling Massachusetts caselaw at or before trial or upon submission of briefs; Plaintiff cites the foregoing statutory and common-law authorities as the legal framework supporting her sole cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $320.00 (for stolen package and out-of-pocket security/deadbolt expenses), plus interest from the date of loss under Massachusetts law;

B. Order Defendant to repair and secure the building’s main entry door lock and to take such other reasonable measures as the Court deems necessary to prevent further unauthorized entries and to vindicate Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the premises;

C. Award Plaintiff costs of this action, including filing fees and other recoverable costs;

D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

VERIFICATION

I, Jessica Ramirez, the Plaintiff in this action, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.

Notes and guidance (for Plaintiff’s convenience)
- Complete blanks (apartment number; exact date of package theft; Defendant’s mailing address for service) before filing and service.
- Consider filing an affidavit of damages and submitting exhibits (photos of broken door, copies of communications to landlord, receipts for security camera and deadbolt, proof of value of stolen package).
- If seeking injunctive relief (order to repair), include a separate request in the initial filing or by motion after filing if necessary.
- Plaintiff is solely pursuing a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in this Complaint. If Plaintiff wishes later to add statutory claims (e.g., housing code violations, M.G.L. c.93A, or summary process defenses), Plaintiff may do so only by amendment consistent with court rules and deadlines.

*Plaintiff cites relevant sections of Massachusetts statutory law and the State Sanitary Code to identify the statutory and regulatory context in which landlord duties and tenant protections arise. Plaintiff intends to rely primarily on common-law principles of quiet enjoyment as developed in Massachusetts caselaw. Plaintiff understands that the precise statutory and case citations and authorities will be articulated and referenced more specifically in pleadings and briefs submitted to the Court as litigation proceeds.
