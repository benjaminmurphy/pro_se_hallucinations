Michael Davis
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING SCHEDULE

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   1.1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Mother") is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff's contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant Michael Davis ("Defendant" or "Father") is the other parent of the children identified below and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
   1.3. This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and rules governing modification of custody and parenting schedules, including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and related statutory and case law regulating custody and modification.

2. Children
   2.1. This Complaint concerns the custody and parenting schedule for the following minor children of the parties:
        - Emily Davis, born 2017 (age 8)
        - Jacob Davis, born 2019 (age 6)

3. Existing Order / Background
   3.1. On or about April 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order (the "Existing Order") establishing a parenting schedule under which Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the minor children, and Defendant has custody every other weekend and one overnight during the week.
   3.2. The Existing Order remains in effect, and Plaintiff seeks modification of that order pursuant to Massachusetts law on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children since the entry of the Existing Order.

4. Factual Allegations Establishing Material Change in Circumstances
   4.1. Since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant has accepted and begun working a new job with a regular schedule of approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM (night shift) on several nights a week, including many of the nights on which Defendant is scheduled to have overnight custody under the Existing Order.
   4.2. As a result of Defendant’s night shift work schedule, Defendant has frequently been fatigued and unable to provide appropriate supervision during the overnight periods allocated to him in the Existing Order.
   4.3. Defendant has on numerous occasions left the children with his roommate or otherwise dropped the children off at Plaintiff’s residence with little or no prior notice, stating that he is too tired after his shift to watch them.
   4.4. Plaintiff has received reports from the children that they often fall asleep on the couch while Defendant naps after arriving home from work, and that Defendant sometimes falls asleep and is not attentive to the children’s needs during the overnight periods.
   4.5. Plaintiff reasonably believes and alleges that these changes in Defendant’s work schedule, availability, attentiveness, and the resulting care arrangements pose a risk to the children’s health, safety, and welfare and materially affect the children’s ordinary routine and stability.
   4.6. The foregoing facts constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that warrant modification in order to serve the best interests of Emily and Jacob.

5. Legal Standard (Statutes and Authorities)
   5.1. The best interests of the child is the controlling standard in custody and parenting time matters under Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (custody provisions); see also Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing parental rights and the child’s best interests standard).
   5.2. Modification of an existing custody or parenting time order requires a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior order and that modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., common law and Probate & Family Court decisions applying the material-change rule and best-interests analysis; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and related Massachusetts authorities.
   5.3. Plaintiff relies on and invokes the statutes and authorities applicable to custody modification, including (without limitation) the statutory and decisional authorities governing custody, modification, and the child's best interest, and by way of example:
        - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory framework governing divorce, custody and related orders);
        - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 and related provisions concerning the welfare of children and the Court’s authority to act in the child’s best interest;
        - Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000);
        - Relevant Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing modification standards and best-interests factors (e.g., cases construing the material-change standard and specifying factors the Court may consider in awarding custody or modifying parenting time).
   5.4. Plaintiff further relies on controlling Probate & Family Court rules and practice directing that parenting schedules be adjusted if one parent’s circumstances materially change in a way that affects the child’s welfare, and that the Court may issue temporary relief when warranted to protect children while a modification is litigated.

   (Note: Plaintiff intends to rely on specific Massachusetts statutory provisions, SJC and Appeals Court precedent, and Probate & Family Court rules and caselaw concerning modification of custody and parenting time, including but not limited to the authorities cited above and any additional relevant authority the Court deems appropriate.)

6. Relief Requested
   6.1. Plaintiff requests that this Court:
        A. Find that, since entry of the Existing Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of Emily and Jacob based on Defendant’s night-shift employment schedule and associated inability to provide appropriate supervision during scheduled overnight parenting time.
        B. Modify the Existing Order to provide that Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when Defendant is off-duty and able to provide active, awake, and appropriate supervision for the duration of the overnight period. Specifically, Plaintiff requests an order providing that:
           i. Defendant may exercise overnight parenting time only on nights when he is not scheduled to work the 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM shift, unless he provides the Court and Plaintiff with verifiable, advance notice (including proof of off-duty status) and demonstrates that he will be capable of fully supervising the children during the overnight period; and
           ii. If Defendant is scheduled to work the night shift or is otherwise unable to demonstrate availability and capacity to supervise the children overnight, Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall be converted to reasonable evening or daytime parenting time during which Defendant is awake and able to supervise the children, or to an alternative parenting time arrangement the Court deems in the children’s best interest.
        C. Order that Defendant provide reasonable advance notice (at least 24 hours, except in emergencies) to Plaintiff if he will be unable to care for the children during his scheduled parenting time, and that in such circumstances he shall not leave the children with an unvetted third party or roommate unless advance written notice and contact information for that person have been provided to Plaintiff and the Court.
        D. Require that Defendant provide a current schedule of his work hours to Plaintiff and to the Court on a monthly basis (or on whatever periodic schedule the Court deems appropriate) so the parenting schedule can be managed in a manner consistent with the children’s best interests.
        E. Award such further temporary and permanent relief as the Court deems necessary to protect the children’s health, safety, welfare, and stability, including but not limited to appointment of a parenting coordinator, temporary modification of parenting time pendente lite, and any orders for supervised exchange or supervised parenting time if appropriate pending further evaluation.
        F. Award Plaintiff costs, fees, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

7. Temporary Relief (if applicable)
   7.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court, pending a full hearing on this Complaint, enter temporary orders (pendente lite) as appropriate to protect the children’s safety and welfare, including temporary modification of Defendant’s overnight parenting time when Defendant is scheduled to work night shifts, or such other temporary arrangements as the Court finds necessary.

8. Verification and Prayer for Relief
   8.1. Plaintiff believes the allegations set forth in this Complaint to be true and correct to the best of her knowledge and information.
   8.2. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
        A. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order;
        B. Modify the Existing Order as requested above to ensure that overnight parenting time occurs only when Defendant is off-duty and available to supervise the children, or to provide an alternative schedule the Court deems in the children’s best interests;
        C. Grant any temporary relief necessary to protect the children pending final determination;
        D. Award any further relief the Court deems just and proper.
