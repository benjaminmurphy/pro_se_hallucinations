JESSICA LANE,
    Plaintiff

v.                                                        Docket No. ___________

MARK LANE,
    Defendant
-------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   a. Plaintiff: Jessica Lane, parent and primary custodial parent of the minor child described below. Contact information: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.
   b. Defendant: Mark Lane, parent of the minor child described below, resident currently on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
   c. Minor child: Sophia Lane, age 8.
   d. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter as the Probate and Family Court that entered the original custody order and under Massachusetts law governing child custody and modification of custody orders.

2. Relevant Prior Order
   a. A prior custody order in this matter was entered on May 15, 2019 (the “2019 Order”).
   b. The 2019 Order awards primary custody of the minor child, Sophia Lane, to the Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, and grants the Defendant, Mark Lane, parenting time consisting of alternating weekends plus one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

3. Statement of Relief Sought
   The Plaintiff seeks modification of the 2019 Order to eliminate the weekly Wednesday midweek overnight with the Defendant and to modify the weekend parenting time schedule to prevent long overnight round-trip drives on school nights, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 Order and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the minor child.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   a. At the time the 2019 Order was entered, the parties lived in the same town and the midweek overnight was a short five-minute drive from the child’s school, such that the overnight and return the next morning posed no material disruption to the child’s school routine.
   b. Since entry of the 2019 Order, Defendant has moved to Cape Cod, a distance of approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school and the Plaintiff’s residence.
   c. Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the Wednesday overnight from the current schedule despite the change in location.
   d. Defendant’s practice under the current schedule is to pick the child up from school midafternoon on Wednesday, transport her roughly ninety (90) miles to Cape Cod, have her stay the night, and then awaken her in the very early morning (approximately 4:30 a.m.) to drive the child back the ninety (90) miles to arrive in time for school on Thursday morning.

5. Adverse Effects on the Child
   a. The long driving distances and extremely early morning return trips have caused the minor child to become chronically sleep-deprived and fatigued.
   b. The child’s teacher has reported a noticeable decline in the child’s participation and alertness on Thursdays following the Wednesday overnight visits.
   c. The Plaintiff has observed, and documents, the child’s increased tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and reduction in normal school-day engagement on Thursdays.
   d. The combination of long-distance travel on a school night and resulting sleep deprivation has negatively affected the child’s school performance and general wellbeing.

6. Best Interests of the Child
   a. The requested modification—elimination of the midweek Wednesday overnight and adjustment of the weekend schedule to avoid marathon drives on school nights—is sought to protect the child’s physical health, educational needs, and emotional wellbeing.
   b. The proposed modification will reduce sleep disruption, allow the child to maintain consistent school attendance and performance, and preserve meaningful weekend parenting time with Defendant without subjecting the child to harmful long-distance travel on school nights.
   c. The modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific changed circumstance (Defendant’s move to Cape Cod) and is supportive of the child’s best interests.

7. Proposed Modification (Requested Relief)
   Plaintiff requests that this Court enter an order modifying the 2019 Order as follows:
   a. Eliminate the weekly midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time with the Defendant.
   b. Adjust the alternating weekend parenting time schedule so that:
      i. Weekend exchanges occur at a mutually convenient, centrally located, and safe exchange point agreed to by the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, at a location designated by the Court;
      ii. The return of the child to school on Sunday evenings or Monday mornings be scheduled so as to avoid long overnight or early-morning school-night travel (for example, by modifying exchanges to allow the Defendant to exercise weekend time without requiring the child to undertake long distance travel on a school night);
      iii. The Court may adopt a specific alternative such as (but not limited to) longer continuous weekend time on alternating weekends, or drop-off/pick-up arrangements that minimize early-morning travel, consistent with the child’s school schedule and best interests.
   c. The Court grant such further and other relief as justice requires, including costs of suit and any evaluation or fact-finding the Court deems appropriate.

8. Statement of Facts Supporting Modification Standard
   a. The change in residence of the Defendant to Cape Cod (90 miles from the child’s school and Plaintiff’s residence) is a substantial, material change in circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the 2019 Order.
   b. The continuation of the midweek overnight under conditions that require the child to be awakened in the pre-dawn hours to complete long-distance travel on a school night materially interferes with the child’s health and educational needs.
   c. Because the change in Defendant’s residence and the resulting travel burdens were not contemplated by the parties at the time of the 2019 Order, and because those burdens materially impair the child’s best interests, modification is appropriate.

9. Request for Hearing and Fact-Finding
   Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule this matter for hearing and, if appropriate, order any necessary fact-finding, including but not limited to a guardian ad litem, psychological evaluation, school records review (including input from the child’s teacher regarding observed impacts), or any other evaluation the Court deems helpful in determining the child’s best interests.

10. Temporary Relief (if applicable)
   Plaintiff further requests that, pending final hearing and determination, the Court enter temporary orders eliminating the midweek Wednesday overnight and directing the parties to adopt a temporary exchange plan that avoids long-distance school-night travel, to prevent further harm to the child’s health and educational functioning.

11. Verification
   The Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the statements contained in this Complaint are true based on Plaintiff’s knowledge and belief.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   1. Modify the 2019 custody order entered May 15, 2019, to eliminate the weekly Wednesday midweek overnight with Defendant;
   2. Modify the weekend parenting time schedule to prevent long-distance travel on school nights and to implement exchange arrangements that are in the child’s best interest;
   3. Order such temporary relief as necessary pending final hearing;
   4. Schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint and permit discovery as needed; and
   5. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
