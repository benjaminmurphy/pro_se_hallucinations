COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

INTRODUCTION

1. This is a Complaint for Modification of a custody order affecting a minor child. Plaintiff Jennifer Collins seeks modification of the existing custody/visitation arrangement entered by this Court on September 15, 2021, on the grounds that there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the health, safety, and welfare of the parties’ minor child, Ethan Collins (age 8), warranting immediate modification of overnight visitation and other conditions to protect the child’s best interests.

PARTIES AND PLEADINGS

2. Plaintiff: Jennifer Collins, residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

3. Defendant: Mark Collins, the child’s other parent, residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.

4. Minor Child: Ethan Collins, born 2017 (age 8), a minor child subject to the prior custody order.

5. Prior Order: The Probate and Family Court entered an order on September 15, 2021, awarding shared legal custody of Ethan, with primary physical residence with Plaintiff and weekend visitation with Defendant (the “2021 Order”).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws governing domestic relations and custody matters, including the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA), because this is the Court that entered the controlling order and the child and parties reside in Worcester County. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B; Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P.; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (domestic relations).

7. Venue is proper in the Worcester Probate and Family Court because the original custody order was entered here and the child primarily resides in Worcester County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS — MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 7 as if fully set forth herein.

9. At the time of the 2021 Order, the Court found the parties able to co-parent and did not impose supervised visitation or restrictions.

10. Since entry of the 2021 Order, the following material changes and circumstances have occurred, which were not known to the Court and which materially affect the child’s safety, health, and welfare:

   a. Statements by the Child: Over the past several months Plaintiff’s son, Ethan, has on multiple occasions reported to Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that, on some visits, Defendant “can’t walk straight.” Ethan has expressed fear and concern about Defendant’s condition on certain visits and has told Plaintiff that he is sometimes very tired and has trouble staying awake on school days after visiting Defendant.

   b. Physical Observations/Video: A neighbor who is aware of the parties’ custody arrangement provided Plaintiff with a video showing Defendant stumbling and appearing unsteady while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night after a visit. The video raises a reasonable concern that Defendant may be under the influence of alcohol or other impairing substances while supervising or transporting the child.

   c. School Reports: School personnel have informed Plaintiff that Ethan appears exhausted on Monday mornings and has been noted to be drowsy and less engaged in class on Mondays following weekend visitation with Defendant. The school’s observations corroborate the child’s reports of fatigue and suggest a pattern that impacts Ethan’s well-being.

   d. Risk to Child: The combination of the child’s statements, the video evidence of Defendant’s unsteady condition while caring for the child, and the school’s concerns constitute a material change in circumstances since the 2021 Order and create a reasonable risk of harm to the child’s safety, health, and welfare if overnight unsupervised visitation continues without restrictions.

11. Plaintiff has made a good faith attempt to address these concerns with Defendant directly and to seek cooperative co-parenting measures, but Defendant has not agreed to voluntarily modify visitation or to submit to reasonable conditions (e.g., prohibitions on overnight unsupervised visitation when impaired, or testing, or supervised exchanges). As a result, Court intervention is necessary.

LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF

12. Modification Standard: Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA) (jurisdictional statutes applicable to custody matters); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (domestic relations statutes governing custody matters); see also cases recognizing that modification is warranted when circumstances materially affecting health or safety change.

13. Best Interests of the Child: The Court’s paramount concern in custody and visitation matters is the best interests of the child. The evidence described above establishes circumstances affecting Ethan’s physical safety, emotional well-being, and school functioning that warrant modification and imposition of conditions to protect the child’s best interests.

14. Reporting and Protective Statutes: If the Court deems it appropriate, allegations of possible parental impairment and resultant risk of neglect or endangerment implicate mandatory reporting and protective laws. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A (child abuse/neglect reporting) and related child welfare provisions intended to protect children from harm.

15. Case Law: Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that where evidence demonstrates a substantial risk to a child’s safety, courts may modify custody and visitation to protect the child, including imposition of supervised visitation, limitations on overnight visits, or other appropriate conditions. See, e.g., relevant Massachusetts authority on custody modification, best interests, and safety-based restrictions.

RELIEF REQUESTED

16. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order modifying the 2021 Order as follows:

   a. Immediate Temporary Relief (pending hearing): Issue an ex parte (or expedited) temporary order, if the Court finds emergency circumstances, providing that Defendant’s overnight visitation with Ethan shall be suspended pending this Court’s hearing on the merits OR that all overnight visits be supervised by a mutually acceptable professional supervisor or approved third party pending resolution. Alternatively, the Court may impose conditions on visitation to ensure the child’s safety (see below).

   b. Primary Relief — Modification of Visitation/Overnights: Modify the custody/visitation provisions of the 2021 Order to require that all overnight visitation with Defendant be supervised, or that overnights be suspended, until Defendant can demonstrate sobriety and an ability to safely parent (for example, by participating in assessment/treatment if indicated) and comply with any Court-ordered conditions.

   c. Conditions for Resumption of Unsupervised Overnight Visitation (if applicable): Require that, before unsupervised overnight visitation is reinstated, Defendant must (a) submit to and follow the recommendations of a Court-approved substance abuse evaluation, (b) provide negative breathalyzer or other testing on the day of exchanges for a period to be determined by the Court, and (c) complete any recommended treatment and provide regular proof of compliance to the Court and Plaintiff.

   d. Supervised Exchanges and Transportation: Require that all child exchanges and transportation during visitation occur in the presence of a sober, responsible adult designated by the Court or a professional exchange supervisor, or at a public, safe location and during daylight hours, until further order of the Court.

   e. School Notifications and Records: Order that the school report to Plaintiff and the Court any future concerns about Ethan’s fatigue, sleepiness, or signs of neglect, and permit Plaintiff reasonable access to school records relating to Ethan’s attendance, performance, and any health or behavioral reports.

   f. Further Relief: Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests, health, and safety of the minor child.
