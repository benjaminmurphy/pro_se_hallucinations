COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 25 Cedar Street, Apartment __, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02302. Plaintiff's contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, MA 02302 (the "Premises"). Defendant may be served at the Premises or at any address Defendant provides to the Court.
1.3 Plaintiff and Defendant are subject to Massachusetts landlord-tenant law. The amount in controversy in this action is within the jurisdictional limits of the Brockton District Court.
1.4 Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the Premises are located in Brockton, and the events giving rise to the claim occurred there.

2. NATURE OF ACTION
2.1 This is an action by a residential tenant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages and other relief resulting from Defendant's failure to provide hot water to the Premises for an extended period and to otherwise afford Plaintiff the use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

3. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
3.1 On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant for the rental of the apartment at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, MA (the "Lease"). Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,500.00.
3.2 Beginning on or about November 30, 2025, the hot water heater supplying Plaintiff's apartment ceased to provide hot water, and Plaintiff had no hot water for showers, bathing, or washing dishes.
3.3 On November 30, 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the lack of hot water. Defendant responded and stated that a part was needed for the water heater and that he had ordered the part.
3.4 Over the following three weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant that the hot water remained unavailable. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the part was backordered and that he was "working on it" but that he could not make the supplier ship faster.
3.5 At all relevant times, Defendant communicated about the repair but did not restore hot water to the Premises. As of December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water for approximately three weeks (from about November 30, 2025).
3.6 As a direct result of the lack of hot water, Plaintiff has suffered loss and inconvenience, including but not limited to:
  a. Paying approximately $30 per month to use a gym to take showers, which is an expense Plaintiff did not have prior to the loss of hot water;
  b. Incurring additional gas and transportation costs to access shower facilities away from the Premises;
  c. Being unable to bathe her infant child at the Premises; Plaintiff was required to take her baby to Plaintiff's mother's house to bathe the infant; and
  d. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises and emotional distress and inconvenience.
3.7 Plaintiff has repeatedly requested Defendant to restore hot water. Defendant has not effected a repair that restores hot water to the Premises in a timely manner.
3.8 Defendant's failure to provide hot water constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and quiet enjoyment of the leased Premises and is a breach of Defendant's obligations as landlord.

4. LEGAL BACKGROUND (AUTHORITIES)
4.1 The covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied covenant in Massachusetts landlord-tenant law guaranteeing a tenant the right to use and enjoy leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant statutes); Commonwealth public health and housing regulations, including 105 CMR 410.000 (the State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
4.2 A landlord's persistent failure to provide essential services such as heat or hot water has long been recognized in Massachusetts and other jurisdictions as constituting a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where such failure substantially interferes with an ordinarily tenant's use of the premises. See, e.g., cases addressing landlord obligations and tenant remedies under Massachusetts common law and statutory schemes; see also summary process and tenant protection statutes, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239, and sanitary code enforcement provisions in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and 111 statutes giving local boards of health authority to enforce housing standards.
4.3 Plaintiff relies upon the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized and applied by Massachusetts courts and upon relevant statutory and regulatory provisions governing landlord duties to maintain premises in a fit and habitable condition and to provide essential services, including hot water. Representative authorities include, but are not limited to: Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 186, 239, and 111; 105 CMR 410.000; and Massachusetts caselaw recognizing the landlord's duty to provide essential services and the tenant's right to undisturbed use and enjoyment of the premises. Plaintiff further relies on Massachusetts decisional law addressing landlord liability for deprivation of essential services and the requirement that landlords take timely action to restore services.

(Note: The allegations and causes of action set forth below are grounded in Massachusetts common law and relevant statutes and regulations as applied by Massachusetts courts and administrative bodies. Plaintiff incorporates and relies on Massachusetts statutory and regulatory authority concerning landlord obligations and housing habitability, including 105 CMR 410.000 (State Sanitary Code), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant law), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process), and related authorities.)

5. CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law)

5.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1.1 through 4.3 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.
5.2 The Lease between Plaintiff and Defendant created landlord-tenant duties. Under the Lease and Massachusetts common law, Defendant had an obligation to provide and maintain essential services supplying the Premises, including hot water, and not to substantially interfere with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the Premises.
5.3 Defendant's prolonged failure to provide hot water — an essential utility — for approximately three weeks despite notice and repeated requests for repair constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and quiet enjoyment of the Premises and is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
5.4 Defendant's breaches have directly and proximately caused Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses (including gym fees and transportation/gas expenses), loss of convenience, emotional distress, and diminution of the benefit of Plaintiff's bargain under the Lease.
5.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages that are reasonably estimated at $450.00, representing out-of-pocket costs and partial rent abatement for the period without hot water, plus any additional damages proven at trial.

6. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:
6.1 Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $450.00, or in such other amount as the Court finds just and proper based on proof at trial;
6.2 Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;
6.3 Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including filing fees and other recoverable costs;
6.4 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to redress Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and to afford Plaintiff full relief.

7. TRIAL BY JURY/COURT
7.1 Plaintiff requests a jury trial on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
