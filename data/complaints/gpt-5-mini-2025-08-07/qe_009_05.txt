COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller brings this action against Defendant Thomas Greene for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment arising from Defendant’s failure to repair and restore electrical service to a bedroom in Plaintiff’s rented two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple St., Springfield, Massachusetts 01105. Plaintiff seeks damages for the loss of use of the bedroom and consequential damages caused by Defendant’s failure to timely repair the defective wiring.

PARTIES, VENUE, AND JURISDICTION

2. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual and a resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555‑0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

3. Defendant Thomas Greene is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple St., Springfield, Massachusetts 01105 where Plaintiff rents a two‑bedroom apartment.

4. Plaintiff began renting the apartment from Defendant on or about June 1, 2022, and currently pays monthly rent of $1,300.

5. Venue is proper in Springfield District Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the premises is located in Springfield and the cause of action arose in Hampden County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates paragraphs 1–5 above as if fully set forth herein.

7. Beginning in approximately mid‑October 2025 (about six weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint), one of the two bedrooms in Plaintiff’s apartment lost electrical service. The affected bedroom’s overhead light is non‑functional and the wall outlets in that room do not supply electricity, while the remainder of the apartment continues to have electricity.

8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the electrical problem promptly after discovery. Defendant arranged for an electrician to inspect the problem. The electrician informed Defendant and Plaintiff that the problem was not a simple outlet replacement but involved defective/old wiring in that specific room and that a more extensive repair or rewiring would be necessary to restore service safely.

9. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that he was obtaining quotes and that the repair was “complicated” because of the building’s old wiring. Defendant has not effected a permanent repair and has not restored electrical service to the affected bedroom as of the date of this Complaint.

10. Because the bedroom has had no electricity for approximately six weeks, Plaintiff has been unable to use the room as a bedroom or as the home office she previously maintained there. Plaintiff has been forced to work from coffee shops for parts of her workday and has incurred average daily expenses of about $15 for coffee and food when doing so. Plaintiff also began and continues to maintain a coworking space membership at $150 per month because the bedroom office is unusable and the apartment living area is too cramped and noisy for reliable remote work.

11. Plaintiff’s office equipment and many personal items are crammed into the living room, substantially interfering with her use and enjoyment of the premises. The loss of the bedroom for sleeping and working, the additional out‑of‑pocket expenses, and the diminished use and comfort of the apartment have caused economic and non‑economic harm.

12. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant effect the necessary repair without unreasonable delay. Defendant has failed to restore the electrical service within a reasonable time and has not offered an interim remedy sufficient to permit Plaintiff to use the room.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–12 above as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, every tenancy carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. The covenant guarantees that a tenant shall have the right to the uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the leased premises, subject only to the rights reserved by the landlord and consistent with the lease. See generally M.P.M. Builders, L.P. v. Dwyer, 442 Mass. 87 (2004) (discussing landlord obligations and tenants’ remedies); Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenants’ remedies for failures to provide habitable conditions); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 5.1, 17.4 (1977).

15. Where a landlord’s actions or failures to act substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises, the landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the tenant may recover damages for the loss of use and any consequential losses proximately caused by the breach. See M.P.M. Builders, L.P. v. Dwyer, 442 Mass. 87 (2004); Javins, 428 F.2d 1071; see also, Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 22.1 (on constructive eviction and breach).

16. The Massachusetts sanitary code and landlord‑tenant statutory framework establish minimum conditions for habitability and the landlord’s obligations to maintain rental premises. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant law generally); 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts Sanitary Code — minimum standards of fitness for human habitation); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health statutory provisions). These authorities inform the scope of a landlord’s duty to provide rental premises suitable for the tenant’s purposes and the tenant’s rights where defects render parts of the premises unusable.

17. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the defective wiring and restore electricity to a bedroom of Plaintiff’s apartment — despite notice and promise to obtain and effectuate a repair — constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The interference has been ongoing for approximately six weeks and has denied Plaintiff the use of one of two bedrooms and her established home office.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages, including but not limited to:
   a. Economic losses: $150 per month for coworking membership (charged pro rata for the period in question), approximately $15 per day in coffee/food expenses when working outside the apartment, and other out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred because of Defendant’s failure to repair the wiring;
   b. Non‑economic harms: loss of the quiet and full enjoyment of the apartment, inconvenience, lost productivity, and disruption of daily life; and
   c. Any other damages permitted by law, including costs and interest.

19. Plaintiff reasonably estimates total damages to date to be approximately $1,800, exclusive of interest and costs. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this calculation if additional losses are identified or if the period of lost use extends beyond the date of filing.
