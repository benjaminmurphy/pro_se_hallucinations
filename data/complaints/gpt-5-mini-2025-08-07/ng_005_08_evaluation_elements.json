    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges defendant possessed and maintained the ladder adjacent to the shared driveway and expressly pleads that defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in storage/securing of objects in shared areas (\u00b6\u00b64\u20136, 11). Defendant\u2019s control of the ladder and shared-use context establish a duty to avoid foreseeable harm."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific facts showing breach: defendant failed to secure, relocate, or tie down the ladder despite repeated warnings from Plaintiff and acknowledgements that he would do so (\u00b6\u00b66, 12\u201313). Those factual allegations adequately describe a negligent failure to act."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the ladder was unsecured and that a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to topple onto Plaintiff\u2019s car (\u00b67), supporting the inference that but for defendant\u2019s failure to secure/move the ladder, it would not have fallen onto the vehicle."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the harm (ladder falling onto a parked car) was a foreseeable result of leaving an unsecured ladder in a zone adjacent to Plaintiff\u2019s parking spot, especially after Plaintiff warned defendant (\u00b6\u00b66, 14\u201315). No superseding/intervening cause is alleged, and foreseeability is pled."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete, out-of-pocket property damages and economic losses (dented hood, cracked windshield, repair costs, insurance deductible, and rental-car expenses) with supporting factual detail (\u00b68, 14; Prayer A)."
