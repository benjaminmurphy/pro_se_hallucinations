It also discusses the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard at length, explaining that while states may use best-interests tests in visitation/custody matters, they cannot override the decisions of a fit parent based solely on a judge\u2019s independent best-interests determination without giving special weight to the parent\u2019s choices. Thus, the case is properly cited as U.S. Supreme Court authority both for recognition of parental rights and for the role of best interests in custody/visitation analysis.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe liberty interest at issue in this case\u2014the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court. \u2026 In light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. \u2026 [T]he Washington statute places the best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge. \u2026 [T]he Due Process Clause does not permit a State to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u2018better\u2019 decision could be made.\u201d"
