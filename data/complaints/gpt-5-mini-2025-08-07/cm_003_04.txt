COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner Jennifer Smith (hereinafter “Petitioner” or “Mother”) respectfully petitions this Court for modification of the parties’ existing custody order affecting their minor child, Michael Johnson (age 8).
1.2 Respondent David Johnson (hereinafter “Respondent” or “Father”) is the other parent of the child and resides within the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 The Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G. L. c. 208 and related statutes because the prior custody order was entered by this Court on May 15, 2021, and the child continues to reside in Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Probate and Family Court.

2. Current Custody Order and Background
2.1 On May 15, 2021, this Court entered an order providing for shared legal custody of the parties’ minor child, Michael Johnson, with a parenting schedule by which Michael resides with Petitioner the majority of the time and visits Respondent on certain weekends (the “Existing Order”).
2.2 Since entry of the Existing Order, Jennifer Smith has been the child’s primary custodial parent; Michael attends school in the community where Petitioner resides.

3. Basis for Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Petitioner brings this Complaint under the Court’s statutory authority to modify child custody and visitation orders when a material change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the child’s best interest (see generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 regarding protection and welfare of children).
3.2 Since entry of the Existing Order, a material change in circumstances has occurred that substantially affects the welfare and safety of the child:
3.2.1 Michael has, on multiple occasions, made statements to Petitioner indicating the Respondent has been consuming “special drinks” at his home and that the Respondent “can’t walk straight” at times when Michael is present.
3.2.2 A neighbor, who is aware of the family situation, forwarded to Petitioner a video showing Respondent stumbling and appearing unable to walk steadily while lifting Michael from a vehicle late at night when returning the child after a weekend visit.
3.2.3 School personnel have informed Petitioner that Michael appears unusually exhausted each Monday morning following weekend visits with Respondent, raising concerns about the child’s sleep, supervision, and safety during those visits.
3.2.4 Petitioner is concerned that Respondent’s apparent intoxication or impairment while caring for Michael poses an immediate and ongoing risk to Michael’s safety and well-being.
3.3 These events and observations constitute a material change in circumstances from those existing at the time of the May 15, 2021 order, when the Court found the parties to be sufficiently stable to justify shared legal custody without special conditions on overnights and unsupervised visitation.

4. Legal Standard
4.1 Under Massachusetts law, modification of a prior custody or visitation order is appropriate where a material change in circumstances has occurred affecting the child’s welfare and where the requested modification is in the child’s best interests. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; see also pertinent Massachusetts caselaw discussing “material change” and best interests of the child.
4.2 Relevant considerations include the child’s safety, physical and emotional well-being, the effect of any impairment on the parent’s ability to care for the child, and the reliability of reported observations from the child, third parties, and professionals. The Court also may order appropriate interim relief if a child’s safety is at risk.

5. Relief Requested — Specific Modifications and Protective Measures
Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the Existing Order as follows:

5.1 Finding of Material Change
5.1.1 A declaration that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior order dated May 15, 2021, thereby authorizing modification of custody/visitation as to Michael Johnson.

5.2 Interim Protective Relief (pending final hearing)
5.2.1 That all overnight visitation by Respondent be suspended pending a prompt evidentiary hearing before the Court; or, in the alternative, that any remaining overnights be temporarily conditioned to require supervised visitation only.
5.2.2 That Respondent be ordered to submit to a substance use screening (urine or other medically accepted testing) within 48 hours of the Court’s order and to submit to random periodic testing at intervals determined by the Court for the pendency of any interim order.
5.2.3 That Respondent immediately undergo a professional alcohol/substance abuse evaluation by a Court-approved evaluator and comply with recommended treatment, if any.
5.2.4 That Respondent be ordered to avoid consuming alcohol or other intoxicants for at least [8–12] hours prior to any contact with Michael and that Respondent not supervise or be responsible for Michael while impaired.
5.2.5 That Respondent be required to attend and complete a parenting program approved by the Court, including instruction on safe supervision of children and the risks of substance use around minors.
5.2.6 That Respondent be required to provide the Petitioner and the Court with addresses and contact information for any residence where Michael would spend time and to allow reasonable safety checks or other monitoring as directed by the Court.
5.2.7 That any violation of these interim protections be a basis for contempt and/or further restriction of Respondent’s parenting time.

5.3 Permanent Modification
5.3.1 After appropriate fact-finding and hearing, that the Court modify the Existing Order to eliminate or restrict overnight unsupervised visits with Respondent, and instead order either supervised visitation or an alternative schedule that protects Michael’s safety and best interests.
5.3.2 That the Court enter such further orders concerning legal custody, physical custody, child exchange procedures, and parental communication as necessary to ensure Michael’s safety and stability.
5.3.3 That the Court reserve jurisdiction to order further testing, treatment, supervised visitation, or other remedies as necessary based on the results of evaluations and the evidence presented at hearing.

6. Factual Support and Evidence
6.1 Petitioner will present testimony at hearing including:
6.1.1 Testimony of Petitioner regarding Michael’s statements to her about Respondent’s “special drinks” and observed impairment.
6.1.2 Testimony from the neighbor who recorded a video of Respondent stumbling while removing Michael from a vehicle (and the video itself as an exhibit).
6.1.3 Testimony from school personnel or submission of school records indicating Michael’s apparent exhaustion following weekend visits.
6.1.4 Any additional evidence the Court finds relevant, including possible expert testimony from a substance abuse evaluator or child-welfare professional.
6.2 Petitioner requests that the Court take such evidence into account in determining whether the requested interim and permanent modifications are appropriate.

7. Authorities and Legal Grounds (Representative)
Note: Petitioner relies upon the statutory authority of the Commonwealth and Massachusetts caselaw governing custody modification, material change in circumstances, and the Court’s duty to protect the welfare of children. Representative statutory and case authorities include, but are not limited to:
Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (Divorce, Alimony, and Child Custody) — statutory authority for custody and modification of custody orders.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (Children, Families and Persons) — authority concerning the welfare and protection of children.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Parentage Act) — provisions on parentage and related custody matters where applicable.
- Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. (Probate and Family Court Rules of Procedure) — rules governing proceedings, emergency motions, and interim relief.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 206, ch. 233 (contempt and enforcement provisions) — for enforcement/remedy purposes.

Representative Massachusetts Caselaw (examples of principles relied upon; Petitioner will rely on relevant SJC and Appeals Court precedents regarding material change, child safety, and supervised visitation):
- Authorities addressing the “material change in circumstances” standard for custody modification and the best interests analysis.
- Authorities addressing the Court’s power to impose conditions on visitation for the protection of a child, including supervised visitation and requirements for substance-abuse evaluation and testing.
- Authorities addressing interim emergency relief where a child’s safety is at risk.

(Petitioner will provide to the Court and opposing counsel copies of the specific reported decisions and statutory provisions upon request and at or before hearing. Petitioner intends to rely on controlling and persuasive Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions interpreting these statutory standards as applied to material changes in circumstances and protective custody modifications.)

8. Request for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
8.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior custody order dated May 15, 2021;
8.2 Enter an interim order immediately suspending unsupervised overnight visits with Respondent pending the outcome of a prompt evidentiary hearing; or, in the alternative, permit only supervised visitation for any visits during the pendency of this action;
8.3 Order that Respondent submit to immediate substance screening and a comprehensive substance abuse evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment as a condition of any parenting time;
8.4 Order such additional protective conditions, monitoring, or visitation protocols (including supervised exchange locations, mandatory sobriety during contact, and attendance at parenting classes) as the Court deems necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of Michael Johnson;
8.5 Schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint and grant such temporary, interlocutory, and permanent relief as the Court finds just and proper in the child’s best interests;
8.6 Award Petitioner the costs of this action and any other relief the Court deems appropriate;
8.7 Reserve jurisdiction to modify its orders further upon submission of additional evidence and evaluations.

9. Verification and Contact Information
9.1 Petitioner brings this action pro se. Petitioner’s contact information:

Notes and Next Steps (for Petitioner’s convenience)
- File this Complaint in the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court (Probate and Family Court Department).
- Consider filing a contemporaneous motion for temporary emergency relief (interim suspension of overnight visitation), attaching any immediately available evidence (the neighbor’s video, a written statement from the neighbor, and any school communications).
- Preserve all evidence: keep the video and any other relevant text messages, emails, school notes, eyewitness statements, and notes of conversations with Michael and school staff.
- If feasible, request a prompt hearing and, if safety is an immediate concern, ask to be heard ex parte under the Court’s emergency powers.
- If desired, the Court clerk can provide local rules on service requirements and forms for pro se litigants.

If you want, I can (a) convert this into a more formal court filing with a caption formatted for Norfolk Probate and Family Court with space for a docket number and signature block, (b) draft a separate Motion for Temporary Emergency Relief to file along with the Complaint, and (c) produce suggested language for an affidavit of facts and exhibits to attach (e.g., a verified affidavit from the neighbor and a copy of the video evidence).
