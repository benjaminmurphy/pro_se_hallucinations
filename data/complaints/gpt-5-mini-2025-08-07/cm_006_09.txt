Jessica Davis
     Defendant/Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner/Plaintiff David Ramirez ("Petitioner") resides at [address omitted]. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent/Defendant Jessica Davis ("Respondent") resides at [address omitted].
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and visitation orders affecting minor children who reside in Massachusetts and under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, M.G.L. c. 209C.

2. Children
2.1 The minor children who are the subject of this Complaint are:
- Emily Ramirez, born 2015 (age 10)
- Noah Ramirez, born 2017 (age 8)

3. Existing Order
3.1 An existing custody/parenting order between the parties was entered by this Court on June 15, 2021 (the "Existing Order").
3.2 The Existing Order awards primary physical custody to Petitioner and grants Respondent alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

4. Relief Sought
4.1 Petitioner seeks a modification of the Existing Order on the ground that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the order and that modification is necessary to protect the best interests, health and safety of the children.
4.2 Specifically, Petitioner requests that the Court enter an order (one or more of the following):
  a. Prohibiting Respondent’s live-in partner (identified in this Complaint by relationship only) from being present during any unsupervised parenting time or visitation with the parties’ minor children; or
  b. Requiring that all visitation by Respondent occur only in the presence of a mutually acceptable third-party supervisor or a Court-approved supervised visitation provider until further order of the Court; and/or
  c. Any other relief the Court deems necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the children, including, but not limited to, adjustments to the times and locations of visitation, exchange procedures, and requirements for notification to Petitioner when the children will be in Respondent’s care.

5. Factual Allegations Establishing Material Change of Circumstances
5.1 When the Existing Order was entered on June 15, 2021, neither party was in a serious romantic relationship and the judgment did not address or contemplate new unrelated adults residing in either parent’s household during parenting time.
5.2 Since entry of the Existing Order, Respondent has begun cohabiting with an adult who:
  a. Has a criminal record that includes assault and battery convictions;
  b. Previously was the subject of a restraining order entered on behalf of a former intimate partner;
  c. Has engaged in behavior, in the presence of the parties’ children, that is alarming and potentially dangerous to the children’s safety and emotional well-being.
5.3 The children have reported the following incidents to Petitioner:
  a. The individual yells frequently in the home and slams doors loudly in a manner that frightens the children;
  b. On one occasion, the individual grabbed one of the children forcefully, leaving a visible mark on the child’s arm;
  c. Neighbors have observed loud and violent arguments at the Respondent’s residence on occasions when the children were present; on at least one such occasion a neighbor called the police because of a loud argument while the children were present.
5.4 Petitioner has reasonable, specific, and recent concerns that the presence of this individual in Respondent’s household while the children are present poses a risk to the children’s physical safety and emotional welfare and constitutes a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the Existing Order.
5.5 Because the Existing Order contains no prohibition or restriction concerning new adults in the Respondent’s household, the Order does not adequately protect the children from exposure to persons with histories of violence or abuse.

6. Legal Basis for Modification
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified when there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. The best-interest standard requires the Court to consider the children’s safety, health, and welfare as primary concerns.
6.2 The situation described above — the presence of an adult with a criminal history of violent offenses and restrained behavior, plus specific recent acts placing the children at risk — constitutes a material change in circumstances justifying modification to protect the children’s safety.
6.3 The statutory and decisional authorities applicable to custody modification, child protection and abuse-prevention in Massachusetts include, without limitation:
  - M.G.L. c. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA));
  - M.G.L. c. 209A (Abuse Prevention Act);
  - M.G.L. c. 119, § 51A (duty to report child abuse and neglect);
  - M.G.L. c. 119, § 39 (and related provisions regarding care and protection of children);
  - Relevant provisions of M.G.L. ch. 208 and ch. 209 addressing jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court over domestic relations and custody matters;
  - Massachusetts case law establishing that custody and visitation orders may be modified on a showing of a material change in circumstances and when modification serves the best interests of the child (including cases interpreting the “material change” standard and permitting limitations or supervision of visits where child safety is at issue);
  - Massachusetts caselaw applying the best interest of the child standard and upholding restrictions on third-party contact or supervised visitation where a parent’s household includes individuals with histories of violence or where the child’s welfare is endangered.
6.4 Petitioner will submit a Memorandum of Law with citations to specific controlling Massachusetts cases and statutory provisions at or before any hearing requested by the Court. (Petitioner requests that the Court accept this Complaint now and schedule a prompt hearing given the children’s ongoing exposure.)

7. Additional Allegations (Precautionary)
7.1 Petitioner is willing to facilitate reasonable supervised visitation arrangements so that Respondent may continue contact with the children in a way that protects their safety, such as court-ordered supervised visitation or specified public exchange/supervised locations.
7.2 Petitioner requests that all exchanges be conducted in a manner and location ordered by the Court to reduce risk to the children (for example, exchanges at a supervised visitation center, police station or other neutral, secure location) until the Court determines otherwise.
7.3 Petitioner requests leave to file supporting affidavits from the children (in camera if the Court prefers), witness statements (including the neighbor who called police), and relevant police reports and medical records documenting the incident where a mark was left on a child, if any such medical treatment occurred.

8. Request for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order:
8.1 Finding that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order of June 15, 2021;
8.2 Modifying the Existing Order as follows (in the alternative to be ordered as necessary):
  a. Prohibiting Respondent’s current live-in partner from being present during any unsupervised parenting time or visitation with the parties’ children; or
  b. Requiring that all of Respondent’s parenting time be supervised either by a mutually acceptable third party or by a Court-approved supervised visitation provider until further order of this Court; and
8.3 Imposing any exchange and notification procedures (including supervised exchange locations) the Court deems appropriate to safeguard the children;
8.4 Granting Petitioner leave to submit affidavits, records and witness testimony in support of this Complaint and reserving to Petitioner the right to seek immediate interim relief if the Court determines such relief is warranted pending final hearing; and
8.5 Granting such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

9. Certification Pursuant to Local Rules
9.1 Petitioner certifies that he will comply with all Probate and Family Court rules regarding attempted resolution and exchange of relevant information, and will provide Respondent with a copy of this Complaint and any supporting affidavits as required by court rule.

Notes and Practical Considerations
- Petitioner should promptly file this Complaint with the Berkshire County Probate and Family Court and request an expedited hearing if he believes the children are in immediate danger.
- Petitioner should collect and preserve any corroborating evidence (photographs of injuries or marks, medical records, police incident reports, witness statements from the neighbor, text messages or other communications, and written statements from the children if appropriate).
- Petitioner should be prepared to present evidence of the partner’s criminal record and any prior restraining order (public records or certified copies).
- Because Massachusetts law requires reporting suspected child abuse or neglect, Petitioner should consider whether a 51A report to the Department of Children and Families is appropriate; counsel or court staff can advise on this point.
- If Petitioner would like, the Court clerk can provide the correct local form caption/docket number and instructions for service. If Petitioner needs a specific proposed order or suggested language for a temporary order pending hearing, he may prepare and submit a proposed interim order requesting supervised visitation or exclusion of the partner and a temporary exchange protocol.
