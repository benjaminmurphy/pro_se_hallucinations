COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

I.      INTRODUCTION

1.     Plaintiff Jessica Hartley (“Plaintiff” or “Hartley”) brings this action against Defendant Robert Thompson (“Defendant” or “Thompson”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages for the persistent and recurrent failure of adequate heat in her rented two‑bedroom apartment at 27 Wilcock St., Dorchester, MA 02124, materially interfering with her use and enjoyment of the premises, causing out‑of‑pocket expenses and personal injury.

II.     PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2.     Plaintiff is an individual residing at 27 Wilcock St., Apt. __, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

3.     Defendant Robert Thompson is the owner and landlord of the building in which Plaintiff resides and may be served at 27 Wilcock St., Dorchester, MA (or at such other address as discovery may show).

4.     Plaintiff entered into possession of the subject apartment and began renting the premises from Defendant on or about June 1, 2022, pursuant to a month‑to‑month tenancy (or lease), for which Plaintiff pays $1,800.00 per month in rent.

5.     This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law and the statutory and common law causes of action alleged herein. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the subject real property is located in Dorchester (Suffolk County) and because this Court has statutory jurisdiction over housing matters.

III.    FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6.     Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully set forth herein.

7.     The apartment Plaintiff rents is a two‑bedroom dwelling located at 27 Wilcock St., Dorchester, MA 02124.

8.     During the winter of 2024–2025 (and continuing on discrete occasions thereafter), the apartment’s central heat repeatedly failed to maintain adequate and consistent indoor temperatures. The heat did not go completely off, but on numerous evenings the indoor temperature would drop to approximately 60° F for several hours at a time, rendering the apartment uncomfortably and unreasonably cold and creating unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.

9.     Plaintiff notified Defendant of the problem. Defendant arranged for repair persons to attend to the building on two occasions. The first repair visit temporarily improved performance for about a week, but the problem recurred. A second technician inspected the heating system and described the building boiler as “old but functional,” indicating limited options. Despite these repair visits, the recurrent drops in temperature continued.

10.    As a direct result of the insufficient and unreliable heat, Plaintiff purchased two electric space heaters in order to maintain a minimally livable indoor environment. The additional electricity usage increased Plaintiff’s monthly electric bills by approximately $150.00 per month during the periods when the heat was unreliable.

11.    The inadequate heating also had an adverse effect on Plaintiff’s health. In January 2025 Plaintiff contracted bronchitis. Her treating physician indicated that the cold indoor air and the intermittent low temperature in the apartment likely exacerbated her respiratory condition. Plaintiff missed three days of work as a result of her illness and incurred out‑of‑pocket medical expenses for antibiotics and related care.

12.    Defendant asserted that the heat was “working” because it never went completely out and the building was not literally freezing. Defendant therefore refused to acknowledge that the intermittent but substantial drops in temperature and the ongoing failure to provide reliable heat constituted a breach of Defendant’s obligations as landlord.

13.    Plaintiff has sustained economic damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to (a) additional electric bills attributable to the space heaters, (b) out‑of‑pocket medical expenses and lost earnings attributable to illness exacerbated by the inadequate heat, and (c) non‑economic loss from deprivation of use and enjoyment of her residence. Plaintiff estimates her compensable damages in this action to be approximately $650.00, exclusive of costs, interest, and other relief requested herein.

IV.     LEGAL BASIS — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

14.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15.    Under Massachusetts common law, a landlord implicitly covenants to provide the tenant with quiet enjoyment and the right to possess and use the leased premises without substantial interference. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord & Tenant) (governing rights and obligations between landlords and tenants); see also Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the landlord’s obligation to provide premises fit for human habitation and enforcing tenant remedies for substantial breaches).

16.    The landlord’s obligation is complemented by state sanitary and housing standards that define minimum requirements for heating and habitability. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); 105 CMR 410.700 (Heating requirements). Where a landlord fails to provide reliable heat as required by applicable standards or where recurrent substantial interference with heat substantially defeats the tenant’s ability to use the premises, the landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may be liable for damages. See Javins, supra; Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (recognizing remedies for breach of warranty of habitability); Kline v. 1500 Mass. Ave. Apartment Corp., 439 F.2d 477 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (landlord responsibility for conditions affecting habitability and safety); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (similar).

17.    The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated where the landlord’s actions or inactions materially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. Material interference may be proved by showing a recurring, persistent deficiency that significantly impairs the habitability or comfort of the dwelling, including inadequate heat during the heating season. See Javins, supra; Green, supra; Park W. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979) (recognizing warranty of habitability and remedies).

18.    Defendant’s repeated failures to provide reliable heating during cold months, despite notice and two repair visits, constitute a material interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. Defendant’s position that the heat is “working” because it never went completely out does not excuse the landlord from liability where the heating system repeatedly failed to maintain reasonable indoor temperatures and rendered the premises substantially less habitable.

19.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered economic loss and personal injury including, without limitation: increased electricity expense (estimated at $150.00 per month during affected periods), medical expenses and lost earnings associated with bronchitis, and other damages described above.

V.      CLAIM FOR RELIEF
        (Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

20.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.

21.    Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to provide the leased premises in a condition consistent with the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the implied warranty of habitability.

22.    Defendant breached that duty by failing to maintain a heating system that would provide reliable, adequate heat during the heating season, thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

23.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff sustained damages in an amount to be determined at trial but presently estimated at $650.00, plus costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

VI.     PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A.     Awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $650.00, or in such other amount as proven at trial;

B.     Awarding Plaintiff pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law;

C.     Awarding Plaintiff costs of suit and reasonable litigation expenses;

D.     Granting any other relief the Court deems appropriate and just under the circumstances to vindicate Plaintiff’s rights under the covenant of quiet enjoyment and applicable law.

VII.    AUTHORITIES (Representative statutes, regulations and authorities Plaintiff intends to rely upon)

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process) (jurisdictional and procedural provisions applicable to landlord/tenant disputes)
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation
- 105 CMR 410.700 (Heating requirements)
- Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970)
- Kline v. 1500 Mass. Ave. Apartment Corp., 439 F.2d 477 (D.C. Cir. 1971)
- Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974)
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984)
- Park West Management Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979)
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (principles concerning covenant of quiet enjoyment and implied warranty of habitability)

Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this list with additional statutory and case authorities, including Massachusetts appellate and trial court decisions concerning quiet enjoyment and implied warranty of habitability, as discovery and further legal research proceed.

VIII.   VERIFICATION

I certify, under penalties of perjury, that the foregoing allegations are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.

Respectfully submitted,
