COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT
ROXBURY DIVISION

Maya Thompson,
    Plaintiff,

v.                                     Civil Action No.: ___________

Richard Greene,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maya Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130. Plaintiff’s contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Richard Greene (“Defendant”) is the landlord and owner/manager of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Premises”), leased to Plaintiff.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written rental/lease agreement for the Premises, effective February 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,500.00.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain (within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court), the amount in controversy is within the court’s jurisdictional limits, and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this county.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff moved into the studio apartment at the Premises on or about February 15, 2022, pursuant to a lease with Defendant.

6. Prior to lease signing and during the showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling in the studio and asked Defendant about them. Defendant represented that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.” Relying on Defendant’s representation, Plaintiff took the unit and signed the lease.

7. During the first significant rainstorm after Plaintiff moved in, water began to drip through the ceiling in the same area where the stains had previously appeared. Plaintiff immediately informed Defendant of the leaking.

8. Defendant repeatedly minimized the problem, characterizing it as a “minor cosmetic issue” and telling Plaintiff that she knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease. Defendant did not arrange for adequate and timely repairs to stop the leak.

9. The leaking progressively worsened. On one occasion during a storm, leaking water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined her laptop that had been left on the coffee table. The laptop had to be replaced at a cost of approximately $900.00.

10. The ongoing leak has caused persistent dampness and a musty odor in the Premises. Plaintiff has developed recurring headaches which she reasonably believes are related to mold growth resulting from the leak and prolonged damp conditions.

11. Plaintiff has had to move her bed and personal effects away from the wet/musty area and, as a practical matter, has been forced to occupy and sleep in only part of the studio unit, substantially diminishing the use and enjoyment of the Premises.

12. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant about the leak and the resulting conditions on multiple occasions since the first storm. Defendant has failed to take reasonable steps to abate the continuing leak and dampness in a timely manner, and has not remedied the conditions that have interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair and abate the conditions caused by the leaking ceiling, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including the $900.00 cost to replace the ruined laptop, diminished use and enjoyment of the leased premises, inconvenience, emotional distress, and other losses. Plaintiff estimates compensable damages at this time of at least $900.00, and reserves the right to seek additional damages proven at trial.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts common law, every lease of a dwelling includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment: the landlord will not substantially interfere with the tenant’s possession and use of the leased premises. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 12.1 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment); see also civil and landlord-tenant authority construing Massachusetts law recognizing tenant protections for substantial interference with possession and habitability issues. The covenant is breached where the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises, including by failing to remedy serious defects that render the premises unfit for their intended residential use. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (seminal authority recognizing tenant protections and obligation to provide habitable premises); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 12.1 & § 18.1; and related authorities.

16. Massachusetts statutory and regulatory law supports the obligation of landlords to provide premises fit for human habitation and free from hazardous or unsanitary conditions. See, e.g., Massachusetts Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); M.G.L. c. 111, § 127A (public health enforcement authority); see also M.G.L. c. 186 (general landlord and tenant provisions).

17. Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to maintain the Premises in a habitable and safe condition and to prevent substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and quiet enjoyment of the Premises. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, among other things:
    a. Representing that the prior leak was “totally fixed,” yet failing to ensure the premises were effectively repaired and protected from water intrusion;
    b. Failing to timely and adequately repair the leaking ceiling and prevent ongoing water intrusion despite repeated complaints by Plaintiff;
    c. Failing to remediate dampness and resulting mold conditions and to abate the persistent musty odor and unhealthy indoor environment; and
    d. Minimizing and failing to address conditions that substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

18. Defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, causing Plaintiff to limit her use of the unit, to relocate personal property within the unit, to suffer damage to personal property (a laptop costing approximately $900.00), and to sustain physical symptoms (headaches) and emotional distress.

19. Plaintiff has performed all obligations required of her under the lease and law, except where performance has been excused by Defendant’s breach.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to $900.00 in property damages (replacement of the laptop), diminution in use and enjoyment of the Premises, and other consequential damages to be proven at trial.

- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 203 (Vt. 1984) (discussing landlord’s responsibility for habitability and tenant remedies) — persuasive authority.
- Regional and Massachusetts case authorities applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties to maintain habitable premises (see, e.g., cases and treatises construing M.G.L. c. 186 and the Sanitary Code); see also authoritative practice materials such as Massachusetts Landlord-Tenant practice treatises and appellate decisions interpreting landlord duties under state law.
- Relevant appellate and trial court decisions in Massachusetts (and persuasive authorities) addressing landlord liability for interference with tenancy, habitability issues, and remedies for breach of quiet enjoyment.
- Additional authorities addressing remedies for breach of the covenant and landlord failures to repair resulting in damage to tenant property and deprivation of full use of leased premises.

(Notes: Plaintiff cites the statutes, regulations, Restatement section, and representative case authorities above as governing legal standards. Plaintiff will rely on Massachusetts case law applying these principles and on other controlling and persuasive authorities as appropriate at trial. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement the list of controlling Massachusetts cases as the case proceeds and discovery reveals further authority.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:
