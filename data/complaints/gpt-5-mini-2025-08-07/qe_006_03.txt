JESSICA RIVERA,
    Plaintiff,
v.                                                      Civil Action No. _______________

MARK THOMPSON,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Rivera (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and a tenant residing at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.
1.2 Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, and may be served at that address (or at his last known address).
1.3 This action arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and common law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The amount in controversy falls within the jurisdictional limits of the Brockton District Court. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the subject property is located in Brockton and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Brockton.

2. Statement of Claim — Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
2.1 Plaintiff brings a single cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law (common law covenant recognized in Massachusetts landlord-tenant jurisprudence), together with applicable statutory and regulatory housing standards relevant to landlord obligations to provide basic services and habitable conditions.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1 On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff began renting a residential apartment located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301 from Defendant pursuant to an oral/written tenancy (the “Premises”). Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00.
3.2 On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water service to Plaintiff’s apartment failed and Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the problem that same day.
3.3 Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s notice and informed Plaintiff that the building’s water heater required a replacement part and that Defendant had placed an order for the part.
3.4 One week later (on or about November 17, 2025), Plaintiff again communicated with Defendant because there was still no hot water. Defendant told Plaintiff the part was backordered.
3.5 One week after that (on or about November 24, 2025), there remained no hot water. Defendant again communicated that the part remained unavailable from the supplier and represented that he was “working on it.”
3.6 As of the date of this filing (December 1, 2025), there has been no hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment for approximately three weeks, and Defendant has not restored normal hot water service.
3.7 The lack of hot water has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. Plaintiff has been unable to take hot showers or to bathe her infant child safely. Plaintiff has incurred additional out-of-pocket expenses including, but not limited to, $30/month gym membership fees to use shower facilities and additional gasoline costs to travel to those facilities. Plaintiff has also been forced to take her infant to the home of Plaintiff’s mother for bathing.
3.8 Plaintiff has at all relevant times tendered full rent to Defendant. Despite Plaintiff’s timely notice and Defendant’s representations that he was attempting to obtain the part and repair the water heater, the interruption of a basic essential service — hot water — has continued for an unreasonable and actionable period of time, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the Premises.
3.9 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to provide and/or promptly restore hot water, Plaintiff has suffered economic losses and other damages in the amount of at least $400.00 (including but not limited to gym fees, gas, and other consequential damages), and seeks an award of damages, costs, and such additional relief as the Court deems just and proper.

4. Cause of Action — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)
Claim for Relief — Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
4.1 Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
4.2 Under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and common law principles that are recognized and applied in this Commonwealth, every tenancy carries with it an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment — the landlord’s obligation that a tenant not be substantially and unjustifiably deprived of the use and enjoyment of the leased premises by the landlord’s acts or omissions or by conditions within the landlord’s control. See, e.g., general principles articulated in Massachusetts authorities and related landlord-tenant law.
4.3 The supply of essential services (including hot water) is a basic requirement for the habitability and use of residential premises; prolonged loss of such essential services is a material interference with a tenant’s possession and enjoyment of the premises.
4.4 Defendant’s failure to restore hot water in a reasonable time after actual notice of the problem, and while the tenant continued to pay rent, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and an unlawful substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.
4.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including economic losses and other consequential damages in an amount to be proven at trial, and currently estimated at a minimum of $400.00.

5. Damages and Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:
5.1 Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of at least $400.00 for out-of-pocket expenses and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, with leave to amend and prove additional damages at trial;
5.2 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to costs of suit; and
5.3 Grant any additional equitable relief the Court finds appropriate under the circumstances.

6. Authorities (Selected Statutes, Regulations, and Precedents)
Plaintiff relies upon and cites the following authorities as relevant to the legal claims and issues in this action (non-exhaustive list). Plaintiff asserts these legal authorities to support the claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations to supply essential services:
Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health)
- 105 CMR 410.000, et seq. (Massachusetts Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
- Relevant local housing codes and regulations administered by municipal boards of health (Brockton Board of Health)
Precedent and Legal Authorities
- Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing that housing conditions and landlord obligations can give rise to remedies for tenants)
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (statutory and common law doctrines on covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations)
- Selected Massachusetts and other persuasive authority addressing landlord obligations, quiet enjoyment, and tenant remedies (including SJC and appellate decisions interpreting the scope of landlord duties and the tenant’s right to habitable conditions and uninterrupted basic services)
(Notes: Plaintiff will provide pinpoint citations and supplementary authority as needed in briefs or at trial. Plaintiff asserts the above statutes, regulations, and authorities as applicable law supporting the covenant of quiet enjoyment claim and as background to the legal duties alleged herein.)

7. Jury Demand
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

8. Verification
I, Jessica Rivera, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Jessica Rivera
