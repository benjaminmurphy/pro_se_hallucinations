Michael Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff: Samantha Johnson ("Plaintiff"), resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: Michael Johnson ("Defendant"), the other parent of the minor children described below, resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
1.3 The Probate and Family Court for Middlesex County has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law because the minor children are Massachusetts residents and the existing custody order was entered by this Court.

2. Minor children
2.1 The minor children who are the subject of this Complaint are:
- Emily Johnson, born 2017 (age 8).
- Ethan Johnson, born 2019 (age 6).

3. Existing Order
3.1 On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a custody order providing for joint legal custody, with Plaintiff having primary physical custody. The order provided that Defendant would have the children every other weekend and one overnight during the week (the “Parenting Schedule” or “Existing Order”).

4. Basis for modification — material and substantial change in circumstances
4.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint under the authority of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and parenting time orders where warranted by a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the children’s welfare (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and other applicable law).
4.2 Since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant has substantially changed his work schedule. Defendant accepted new employment that requires him to work overnight hours, typically from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., on multiple nights per week, including many of the nights on which he is supposed to have overnight parenting time under the Existing Order.
4.3 Because of Defendant’s overnight work schedule:
a. Defendant frequently returns home exhausted and reports that he is too tired to supervise or care for the children on nights he works, and as a result has left the children in Plaintiff’s care on short or no notice.
b. Defendant has on multiple occasions left the children with a roommate or other third party (whose identity and qualifications Plaintiff does not know) rather than exercising his scheduled parenting time himself.
c. The children (Emily and Ethan) have reported to Plaintiff that Defendant often falls asleep on the couch after returning from work and that the children have fallen asleep there as well while Defendant naps.
4.4 These circumstances materially and substantially differ from the circumstances that existed at the time the Existing Order was entered. At the time of the original order the parties both worked regular daytime schedules and the parenting schedule functioned as intended; the unanticipated overnight work schedule and the resulting pattern of inadequate supervision, unscheduled returns of the children to Plaintiff’s care, and placement of the children with non-parent third parties are unforeseeable, ongoing changes that affect the children’s health, safety, and welfare.
4.5 The Defendant’s changed circumstances and conduct have created an ongoing risk to the children and impose disruption on the children’s routine and on Plaintiff’s caretaking responsibilities. Plaintiff submits that this constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the Existing Order to protect the children’s best interests.

5. Children’s best interests
5.1 Modification of custody and parenting time should be guided by the best interests of the children — including, but not limited to, the children’s safety, health, developmental needs, the stability of each parent’s home environment, the children’s relationships with each parent, and the ability of each parent to provide appropriate supervision given work schedules and other practical constraints.
5.2 Defendant’s overnight work schedule and the incidents described above adversely affect the children’s routine, sleep, supervision, and safety and interfere with Plaintiff’s role as primary custodian. Modification is necessary to ensure the children have stable, predictable care and are not placed in situations where adequate supervision and care are uncertain.

6. Relief requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the Existing Order as follows:
6.1 Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order and that modification is in the best interests of Emily and Ethan.
6.2 Modify the parenting schedule so that overnight parenting time for Defendant only occurs on nights when Defendant is not scheduled to work the overnight shift and is otherwise available to provide direct, active parental care. Specifically:
a. Require Defendant to provide to Plaintiff and to the Court, on a continuing basis, a weekly or monthly work schedule that specifies the days and hours Defendant is scheduled to work at least 14 days in advance; and
b. Provide that the Defendant’s scheduled overnight parenting time will be exercised only on nights when Defendant’s posted work schedule confirms he is not scheduled for an overnight shift the same night and where Defendant affirms he will be awake and able to supervise the children; and
c. If Defendant has an unexpected change in his schedule that prevents him from exercising scheduled parenting time, Defendant shall provide as much advance notice to Plaintiff as is practicable (and in any event no later than 6:00 p.m. on the day of the scheduled overnight) and shall make reasonable arrangements to ensure that the children are supervised by a responsible adult approved in advance by Plaintiff (or otherwise return the children to Plaintiff’s care), with an obligation on Defendant to provide the identity and contact information of any third-party caregiver and to obtain Plaintiff’s consent prior to leaving the children with any third party for scheduled overnight parenting time; the consent shall not be unreasonably withheld where the third party is a responsible adult who is known to Plaintiff and has demonstrated reliable caregiving.
6.3 Alternatively, if the Court prefers a more specific parenting schedule, modify the schedule so that Defendant’s parenting time is limited to daytime periods on Defendant’s non-working days and every other weekend day and evening until further order of the Court.
6.4 Order that there be a mandatory status conference with the parties to revisit and, if necessary, further modify the parenting schedule after a reasonable transitional period (for example, 60–90 days).
6.5 Order that Defendant cooperate in mediation or with a parenting coordinator if the Court deems it appropriate to facilitate a workable parenting plan that accommodates Defendant’s employment while protecting the children’s best interests.
6.6 Order any other relief the Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to costs of suit, reasonable attorney’s fees (if appropriate under the circumstances and law), and such temporary orders as may be necessary to protect the children pending a hearing on this Complaint.

7. Jurisdictional allegations and authority
7.1 The Court has statutory authority to modify custody and parenting time orders as provided under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks modification pursuant to the Court’s continuing authority over custody determinations and parenting plans.
7.2 The parties and children are residents of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and this Court entered the Existing Order; therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.

8. Prayer for relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court:
a. Set this matter for hearing;
b. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification of the Existing Order is in the children’s best interests;
c. Modify the Existing Order as requested in paragraph 6 above (or in such other manner as the Court deems appropriate to protect the children’s best interests);
d. Order such interim relief as the Court finds required while this matter is pending;
e. Order the Defendant to produce his work schedule and to cooperate in the implementation of any modified parenting plan; and
f. Grant any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.

Verification
I, Samantha Johnson, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the facts stated in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
