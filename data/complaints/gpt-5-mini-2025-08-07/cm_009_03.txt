I can draft a complete, professionally formatted Complaint for Modification using the facts you provided. I must be candid: I cannot invent or fabricate legal citations or cases. I can, however, include accurate statutory references I am confident about (for example, the Massachusetts UCCJEA, M.G.L. c. 209B), and I can clearly state the governing legal standards (the “material change in circumstances” requirement and the “best interests of the child” standard). If you need a list of specific SJC (Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court) cases and additional statutory citations, I recommend you confirm them with a lawyer or the court clerk before filing so everything precisely matches current Massachusetts authority.

Below is a complete Complaint for Modification, formatted and containing all required sections (caption, parties, factual allegations, statement of material change in circumstances, requested relief, signature block, verification). I include a limited, accurate statutory reference (M.G.L. c. 209B) and reference the controlling legal standards. If you want, I can add a separately labeled “Authorities” list later that you or a lawyer can supplement with precise case citations.

Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/CHILD REARING ORDER

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, and respectfully states the following in support of this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody/visitation order concerning the minor child, and alleges:

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   a. Plaintiff: Laura Jenkins, residing at (Plaintiff’s address omitted for public filing), may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
   b. Defendant: Mark Jenkins, (address omitted for public filing), is the other parent of the minor child identified below.
   c. Minor Child: Emily Jenkins, born in 2017 (age 8).
   d. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law to modify custody and visitation orders pertaining to minor children. The Barnstable Probate and Family Court is the appropriate venue for modification of the 2019 custody order entered in this county (see M.G.L. c. 209B regarding child custody jurisdiction).

2. Existing Order
   a. An existing custody/visitation order (the “2019 Order”) was entered on May 15, 2019.
   b. The 2019 Order designates Plaintiff as primary custodian and grants Defendant visitation every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

3. Material Change in Circumstances
   a. Since entry of the 2019 Order, Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod (approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s primary residence and school).
   b. At the time the 2019 Order was entered, the parties lived in the same town and the Wednesday overnight involved a five-minute drive to school the following morning.
   c. Defendant nevertheless continues to exercise the Wednesday midweek overnight under the exact same pattern despite the significant relocation.
   d. Defendant picks the child up from school on Wednesdays, transports her approximately ninety miles to Cape Cod, and returns with the child the following morning for school. The Defendant has been waking Emily at approximately 4:30 a.m. to undertake the return drive so she can attend school on Thursday morning.
   e. The frequent long drives and early-morning wakings have caused the child to be chronically fatigued. Her teacher reports a noticeable drop in Emily’s participation and attentiveness on Thursdays.
   f. The Defendant has refused to modify the midweek overnight despite these impacts on the child’s health, school functioning, and overall well-being.

4. Legal Standard
   a. Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification of an existing child custody/visitation order must show a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order that affects the child’s welfare such that modification is in the child’s best interests.
   b. The primary consideration in any custody or visitation dispute is the best interests of the child, including the child’s health, education, emotional development, and need for stability and routine.
   c. The facts alleged above—Defendant’s relocation, the long overnight travel pattern, early-morning return drive, and negative effects on the child’s sleep and school performance—constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the 2019 Order to protect the child’s best interests.

5. Facts Supporting Modification
   a. Practical Impact: The long-distance commute on school nights substantially interferes with Emily’s normal sleep, rest, and ability to participate in school activities the day after the overnight.
   b. Educational Impact: Emily’s teacher has observed and reported a measurable decline in participation on Thursdays directly correlated to the Wednesday overnight and return schedule.
   c. Health/Well-being Impact: Chronic sleep disruption has both short- and long-term consequences for an eight-year-old’s cognitive functioning, mood, and behavior; the Defendant’s insistence on preserving the midweek overnight despite relocation exacerbates these harms.
   d. Alternatives and Reasonableness: Reasonable alternatives exist that would allow Defendant meaningful contact without subjecting the child to disruptive overnight travel during the school week—for example, eliminating the Wednesday overnight and adjusting weekend time or using extended weekend or holiday parenting time to accommodate longer-distance travel without interrupting school nights.

6. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   a. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2019 Order such that the existing midweek overnight visitation on Wednesdays is no longer in the best interests of the minor child.
   b. Modify the 2019 custody/visitation order by eliminating the midweek Wednesday overnight visit; or, in the alternative, modify the midweek schedule to one that does not require overnight travel that interferes with school (for example, convert the midweek overnight to a daytime visit or telephone/video contact).
   c. Adjust the weekend visitation schedule so that Defendant may exercise meaningful and regular parenting time without requiring the child to undertake long-distance travel on school nights (Proposed adjustment to be set by the Court).
   d. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable to protect the best interests, health, and educational stability of Emily Jenkins, including but not limited to temporary relief as needed to prevent ongoing harm pending final hearing.
   e. Award Plaintiff costs and such other relief as the Court deems proper.

7. Request for Temporary Relief (if the Court deems appropriate)
   a. Plaintiff requests the Court consider a temporary order (ex parte or expedited as appropriate under Court rules) eliminating the Wednesday overnight parenting time or otherwise preventing the Defendant from imposing long-distance, early-morning return trips on school nights pending a hearing on the merits, on grounds the child is currently experiencing demonstrable harm to health and school functioning.

8. Verification
   I, Laura Jenkins, declare under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Laura Jenkins

Notes and Practical Suggestions
- File the Complaint with the Barnstable Probate and Family Court clerk’s office; request an expedited/temporary hearing if you believe the child is presently being harmed by the Wednesday overnight schedule.
- Bring supporting documentation to the hearing: the 2019 Order (entry date 2019-05-15), evidence of Defendant’s change of address/relocation to Cape Cod, school records or a teacher’s written statement describing Emily’s decline in participation on Thursdays, any communications with the Defendant about modifying visitation, and any contemporaneous notes about the child’s sleep and behavior.
- The Court will consider the “material change in circumstances” and the child’s best interests at the hearing. Be prepared to describe concretely how the Wednesday overnight materially harms Emily’s health and school performance and to propose a specific revised schedule for the Court’s consideration.
- If you want me to add an “Authorities” section listing statutes and cases, I can draft a suggested list, but I cannot certify that each case and statutory cross-reference is the most current authoritative citation for Massachusetts custody modification law. If you want that list, I will include general, widely recognized authorities (for example, M.G.L. c. 209B (UCCJEA), and federal authority such as Troxel v. Granville) and flag that you should verify case citations with the court clerk or an attorney before filing.

If you want, I can:
- Add a proposed revised parenting plan schedule (detailed times/days) to append to the Complaint;
- Draft a proposed temporary order form for expedited hearing;
- Draft the Certificate of Service with a specific address and service method if you provide the Defendant’s address.

Which of those would you like me to prepare next?
