v.                                                  Docket No. __________

David Brown
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1.     Parties
1.1    Plaintiff: Jessica Martinez, residing in Cambridge-area (current address on file with the Court). Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2    Defendant: David Brown (last known residence in the Cambridge area; address to be served at known address).

2.     Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1    This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify child custody and visitation orders and related statutes governing custody and jurisdiction, including, without limitation, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (domestic relations), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — UCCJEA), and other applicable law.
2.2    Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the operative custody order was entered in this Court and the child resides in this judicial district.

3.     Existing Order and Background
3.1    On March 15, 2021, this Court entered an order (the “Existing Order”) establishing primary physical custody of the parties’ daughter, Sofia Brown (age 8), with Plaintiff Jessica Martinez, and awarding Defendant visitation on Wednesdays (midweek overnight) and every other weekend.
3.2    Under the Existing Order, the parties and the child reasonably lived in the Cambridge area and the custody/visitation schedule was premised on relatively short travel times and the child’s regular attendance at her local school and participation in after-school activities.

4.     Relief Sought
4.1    Plaintiff seeks an order modifying the Existing Order to (a) eliminate midweek overnight parenting time (the Wednesday overnight) for Defendant, and (b) modify the alternate-weekend schedule to a schedule that is workable given significant change in circumstances (including reasonable transfers and adjustments to account for the distance), all in the best interests of the child.
4.2    Plaintiff asks the Court to make any further or different orders necessary to protect Sofia’s educational needs, emotional well-being, and physical health, including an order specifying pick-up/drop-off arrangements at a mutually convenient midpoint or other reasonable transfers, and any necessary findings that the proposed out-of-state midweek overnights are not feasible and would be detrimental to the child’s best interests.

5.     Facts Constituting a Material Change in Circumstances
5.1    Since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant has informed Plaintiff of his intent to relocate his residence to New Hampshire for a job opportunity and to continue to exercise the exact same visitation schedule (including midweek overnights and alternate weekends).
5.2    Defendant’s proposed relocation would increase each one-way trip time for custody exchanges to approximately ninety (90) minutes or more in traffic; midweek overnights would require the child to take long drives midweek, miss part of the school day or be required to depart home very early the next morning, and disrupt after-school activities.
5.3    The increased travel time and logistical burdens have already begun to negatively affect Sofia. Sofia has expressed anxiety about the long drives and has missed or had to forego after-school activities because of scheduling and travel constraints associated with the proposed arrangement.
5.4    Plaintiff is concerned that preserving the Wednesday overnight and other terms of the Existing Order without change will: (a) lead to fatigue, school disruption, and anxiety for Sofia; (b) interfere with school attendance and extracurricular activities that are important to her development; and (c) create safety and welfare concerns from frequent long highway travel, particularly on evenings before school days.
5.5    These developments constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since March 15, 2021 that warrant modification of the Existing Order.

6.     Legal Basis for Modification
6.1    Modification Standard — The Court has the authority to modify an existing custody or visitation order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and best interests. The legal standard governing custody modifications emphasizes the child’s best interests and the need to adapt custody arrangements to changed circumstances. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and ch. 209B (UCCJEA); Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights and deference to fit parental decision-making in custody/visitation contexts); and recognized Massachusetts authority on modification and best-interest analysis.
6.2    Best Interests Factors — In determining custody and visitation modifications, the Court considers the best interests of the child, including but not limited to the child’s health, safety, schooling and extracurricular needs, ties to school and community, the capability of each parent to meet the child’s needs, and the practical logistics of a parenting schedule that will promote stability and minimize disruption. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B; applicable Massachusetts case law on custody and modification standards.
6.3    UCCJEA and Jurisdiction — If relocation leads to interstate jurisdictional considerations, the UCCJEA (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B) and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C. § 1738A) provide the framework for interstate custody jurisdiction and enforcement. The plaintiff requests that the Court apply the UCCJEA and related law as necessary in resolving any jurisdictional questions and in fashioning an appropriate, enforceable modification.
6.4    Application to Facts — Given Sofia’s age (8), school schedule, established community ties, current anxiety and disruption from increased travel, and the practical impossibility of maintaining the Wednesday overnight without substantial adverse effects, Plaintiff requests the Court exercise its modification authority to eliminate midweek overnight parenting time and to adjust the weekend schedule to reduce travel burden and protect Sofia’s best interests.

7.     Requested Orders
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order:
7.1    Modifying the Existing Order by removing the midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time for Defendant;
7.2    Modifying the alternate-weekend schedule to a schedule appropriate for the parties’ changed circumstances and the child’s best interests (for example, reasonably extended continuous weekend time on alternate weekends with transfers at an agreed-upon midpoint or at school or daycare as the Court finds appropriate, or an equivalent schedule that reduces midweek travel and school disruption);
7.3    Directing specific pick-up and drop-off arrangements (including a reasonable midpoint transfer location, or other reasonable transfer points) to minimize travel time each way, to be determined by the Court;
7.4    Granting any temporary or emergency relief as the Court deems necessary pending final determination (including temporary suspension of midweek overnights);
7.5    Making any findings or orders required under the UCCJEA, Massachusetts law, and related authority; and
7.6    Granting such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

8.     Supporting Authorities (Representative statutes and caselaw cited for guidance)
Plaintiff invokes the Court’s modification authority and reliance on applicable statutory and case law, including but not limited to:
Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (domestic relations; court authority over custody and modification).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — UCCJEA).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §39 (regarding child welfare and the Court’s interest in the protection of children).
- 28 U.S.C. § 1738A (Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act — interstate recognition and enforcement of custody determinations).
- Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure and Probate and Family Court rules governing custody/visitation modifications.
Case Law (representative family-law authorities concerning modification/best interests/parental rights)
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental autonomy and judicial best-interest analysis in visitation matters).
- [Mass. authority addressing best-interests and modification] (courts have long held that modification requires a material change in circumstances and that the child’s best interests govern).
- [Mass. authority applying UCCJEA jurisdictional principles].
- [Mass. cases addressing impact of parental relocation on custody/visitation].
- [Mass. cases recognizing child’s schooling, activities, and emotional well-being as critical best-interest factors].
(Notes: Plaintiff cites these statutes and leading authority for the Court’s guidance on jurisdiction, modification standards, and best-interest analysis and will rely on specific Massachusetts caselaw and statutory sections at hearing and in memoranda of law filed with the Court.)

9.     Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
9.1    Enter an order modifying the March 15, 2021 custody/visitation order by removing midweek (Wednesday) overnights for Defendant and by adjusting the weekend schedule to a practicable, child-centered schedule compatible with Defendant’s proposed relocation;
9.2    Order reasonable transfer locations and times to limit Sofia’s extensive travel and to preserve her school attendance and activities;
9.3    Grant any temporary relief necessary pending a final hearing;
9.4    Make findings as required under the UCCJEA and Massachusetts law; and
9.5    Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
