COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE
(DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL)

1.     Plaintiff Ryan Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Discount Home Goods, Inc. ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES

2.     Plaintiff Ryan Thompson is an individual and resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is:
       Phone: (617) 555-0123
       Email: psm1443@gmail.com

3.     Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. is a business corporation that owns, operates, and/or controls the retail discount home-goods store located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (the "Store"). At all relevant times Defendant maintained, staffed, supervised, managed and controlled the Store and its premises.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4.     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts and the Defendant conducts business in the Commonwealth.

5.     Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 2 and applicable venue statutes because the accident and injuries occurred in Middlesex County and Defendant transacts business in Middlesex County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6.     On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately [time], Plaintiff was a lawful invitee on Defendant’s premises at the Store located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff was shopping in an aisle in the kitchen goods section.

7.     The Store had heavy boxed appliances stacked high on retail shelving—approximately five to six boxes high—without physical securing devices such as straps, guards, barriers, or other reasonable restraints to prevent them from falling.

8.     Another customer was passing through the aisle with a shopping cart and made ordinary contact with a lower shelf, a normal bump consistent with ordinary shopping activity. As a result of the unrestrained high stacking of heavy boxes, a large toaster-oven box (a heavy boxed appliance) dislodged from near the top of the shelving and fell onto Plaintiff, striking Plaintiff on the side of the head and shoulder.

9.     Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a severe headache. Store management attended to Plaintiff, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.

10.    Later the same evening Plaintiff presented to the emergency department for evaluation. Medical personnel diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain and provided medical treatment. Plaintiff’s approximate medical expenses to date are $1,500. Plaintiff missed work as a delivery driver and lost approximately $800 in wages. Plaintiff also was unable to play in his recreational soccer league for about one month, suffering loss of enjoyment and other non-economic harms.

11.    The injuries, medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, and other damages suffered by Plaintiff were proximately caused by the Defendant’s negligence and failure to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for its invitees.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS OF NEGLIGENCE

12.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13.    At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee, the duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance and operation of the Store, to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition, and to warn of known dangerous conditions that were not obvious to invitees. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A; see also Massachusetts law recognizing the duty of proprietors to invitees to maintain safe premises and to warn of hazards.

14.    Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:
       a.   Failing to secure heavy boxed merchandise stored on high retail shelving with appropriate restraints, straps, guards, barriers, or other measures reasonably necessary to prevent boxes from falling and injuring customers;
       b.   Failing to maintain the Store’s shelving and displays in a reasonably safe manner for invitees;
       c.   Failing to inspect and supervise the storage and display of heavy boxed merchandise with reasonable frequency and care;
       d.   Failing to place warning signs, barriers, or other effective warnings of the hazard posed by unstable or improperly stacked heavy merchandise;
       e.   Allowing a dangerous condition to exist in an aisle where customers, including Plaintiff, were invited to walk and browse.

15.    Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages, in that but for Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and securing merchandise, the boxed appliance would not have fallen and injured Plaintiff.

DAMAGES

16.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:
       a.   Physical pain and suffering, including a concussion and shoulder strain;
       b.   Medical expenses (past and future) in an amount reasonably estimated at $1,500 to date, with future medical expenses to be proven at trial;
       c.   Lost earnings and loss of earning capacity in an amount reasonably estimated at $800 to date, with additional lost wages or diminished earning capacity to be proven at trial;
       d.   Emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages;
       e.   Costs of suit, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

CAUSE OF ACTION
COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.

18.    The acts and omissions of Defendant alleged above constitute negligence under Massachusetts law in that Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care for the safety of its customers, and that failure was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

19.    Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from Defendant for all losses, damages and injuries that were proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.

APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND AUTHORITIES

20.    The duty of care owed by possessors of land to invitees is well-established under Massachusetts law and general tort principles: proprietors must exercise reasonable care to keep the premises safe and warn invitees of nonobvious dangers, and may be liable for injuries caused by foreseeable dangerous conditions. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; see also, e.g., McGonigle v. Boston, (cases interpreting reasonable care of proprietors); Steir v. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., 382 Mass. 707 (1981) (discussing duty to supervise and foreseeability); Carroll v. United States (premises liability principles applied); and analogous Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court decisions recognizing the duty and standards for proprietors.

21.    Comparative negligence and apportionment principles apply to tort actions in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 231, § 85K (comparative negligence; apportionment of fault), and related Massachusetts caselaw. If the Defendant asserts any claim of contributory fault by Plaintiff, apportionment of damages should be governed by Massachusetts law.

22.    Plaintiff expressly invokes the following statutes, restatements, and Massachusetts authorities as relevant legal support for his claims of negligence and the relief sought herein (non-exhaustive list):
       - Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 231, Section 85K (comparative negligence / apportionment);
       - Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 231, Sections governing civil actions and venue as applicable;
       - Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343–344, 346 (duty of possessor of land to invitees; duty to inspect and warn);
       - Steir v. Girl Scouts of U.S.A., 394 Mass. 111 (1985) (duty to supervise/foresee hazards);
       - Smith v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 381 Mass. 172 (1980) (premises liability principles);
       - Rinaudo v. United States (premises/owner responsibility and foreseeability principles);
       - Barr v. Commonwealth (cases addressing duty and breach by land possessors);
       - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (open and obvious dangers and duty to warn);
       - Massachusetts cases applying reasonableness standard for store operators and duty to customers (e.g., cases recognizing that merchants have a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining displays and preventing foreseeable harm to invitees);
       - Any other relevant Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court precedent addressing foreseeability, duty, breach, causation and damages in premises liability and negligence actions.

(Notes: Plaintiff relies on the foregoing statutes, restatements and Massachusetts caselaw and reserves the right to amplify and supplement authorities and legal arguments by citation to additional statutes, rules and authorities as the case proceeds and discovery develops.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A.     Award compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses in an amount to be determined at trial, including approximately $1,500 in past medical expenses and future medical needs to be proven;

D.     Award costs of suit, statutory interest to the fullest extent permitted by law from the date of the accident, and all other relief the Court deems just and proper;
