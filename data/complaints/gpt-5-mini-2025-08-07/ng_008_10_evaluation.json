Cardozo\u2019s analysis focuses on whether the railroad owed any duty to this particular plaintiff based on foreseeability, not on maintaining premises in a safe condition or warning of non-obvious dangers. The case is thus not authority for the invitee-duty proposition and is being cited for the wrong legal principle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe conduct of the defendant\u2019s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus removed. Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the violation of a right.\u201d"
