COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Petitioner. Emily Johnson (hereinafter “Petitioner”), pro se, may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent. Mark Smith (hereinafter “Respondent”).
1.3 Child. The minor child subject to this action is Sophia Smith, age 12.
1.4 Jurisdiction and Venue. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters. Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior custody order was entered by this Court and the child resides in this county.

2. Existing Order and Relief Requested
2.1 On March 12, 2019, this Court entered a custody order providing for fifty/fifty (50/50) shared physical custody on a week-on/week-off rotation between Petitioner and Respondent (the “Existing Order”).
2.2 Petitioner brings this Complaint seeking modification of the Existing Order on the basis of a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests and safety of the child, and requests that the Court (a) award primary physical custody of the child to Petitioner, (b) modify Respondent’s parenting time to a schedule consistent with the child’s safety and Respondent’s demonstrated ability to care for the child, and (c) grant any temporary or other relief the Court deems appropriate pending final adjudication.

3. Factual Allegations Establishing a Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 The Existing Order functioned well while both parents lived nearby and were able to safely care for the child. The parties followed the week-on/week-off schedule, and the child maintained stable routines in both homes.
3.2 Within the past year Respondent has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition. As a result of that condition Respondent experiences physical limitations, including balance problems and weakness that have caused multiple falls at home.
3.3 Respondent’s treating physician has advised that Respondent should not be alone with the child in situations that present a risk of fall or require rapid physical response, and that Respondent should not be responsible for physically lifting or transferring without assistance.
3.4 Despite that medical advice, Respondent insists on continuing the exact same week-on/week-off 50/50 physical custody schedule and, on multiple occasions, has relied upon the child to assist Respondent in physically transferring to and from a wheelchair or bed and/or to retrieve items for Respondent. The child has been asked to perform physically demanding and caregiver-type tasks beyond what is appropriate for a 12-year-old.
3.5 Respondent’s falls have occurred in the child’s presence and have required medical evaluation on at least one occasion. Respondent’s inability to reliably prevent falls or to follow medical advice about not being alone with the child near stairs or in other potentially dangerous situations poses a substantial risk to the child’s safety.
3.6 Petitioner has attempted to work cooperatively with Respondent to arrange safer visits and to reduce safety risks (including offers to modify the schedule, have shorter or supervised visits, or to arrange additional in-home assistance) but Respondent refuses to accept reasonable safety-oriented modifications and continues to insist upon the existing 50/50 rotation despite medical advice to the contrary.
3.7 The foregoing facts constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that adversely affects the child’s safety and welfare and therefore justifies modification of the custody arrangement in the child’s best interests.

4. Legal Basis for Relief
4.1 Petitioner seeks modification of the Existing Order pursuant to the probate and family court’s authority to modify custody/parenting orders when a material change in circumstances warrants reconsideration of the child’s custodial arrangement in light of the best interests and welfare of the child.
4.2 Petitioner will ask the Court to find that the foregoing facts constitute such a material change in circumstances and to enter an order modifying physical custody so that the child’s primary residence is with Petitioner, with parenting time for Respondent limited or conditioned as necessary to protect the child’s safety while preserving the child’s relationship with Respondent.
4.3 Petitioner also requests that the Court consider and order any of the following ancillary measures as appropriate:
   a. Temporary ex parte or pendente lite order granting primary physical custody to Petitioner pending an expedited hearing, on the basis of imminent risk to the child’s safety;
   b. Reasonable supervised or assisted parenting time for Respondent (including home-based assistance, companion, or supervised transition time) until Respondent demonstrates the ability to care safely for the child in accordance with medical advice;
   c. A medical/functional capacity evaluation of Respondent by a qualified physician or rehabilitative professional concerning Respondent’s ability to safely parent a 12-year-old child;
   d. Appointment of a guardian ad litem or counsel for the child where appropriate;
   e. An independent home safety evaluation and any necessary restrictions (e.g., stair access, assistive devices, in-home aide) to assure the child’s safety while in Respondent’s care;
   f. Such other and further relief as the Court deems necessary to protect the child’s welfare.

5. Requested Findings
5.1 Petitioner will request that the Court make explicit findings that:
   a. The Respondent has sustained a material change in physical condition and functioning since entry of the Existing Order;
   b. Respondent’s condition and conduct (including reliance on the child for physical assistance and failure to follow treating physician’s advice) create a risk to the child’s safety that was not present at the time of the Existing Order;
   c. Modification of physical custody to establish primary residence with Petitioner and an appropriate, safety-based parenting time plan is in the child’s best interests.

6. Temporary Relief Sought
6.1 Because of the child-safety concerns noted above, Petitioner requests that the Court enter temporary pendente lite relief awarding primary physical custody to Petitioner pending a hearing on this Complaint and ordering that Respondent’s parenting time be (a) limited to supervised or assisted visits, or (b) otherwise modified to ensure the child’s safety, until the Court determines otherwise.
6.2 Petitioner further requests expedited discovery and scheduling of a hearing, and an order requiring Respondent to produce medical records and related documents concerning the diagnosis, prognosis, and treating physician’s recommendations relevant to Respondent’s ability to safely parent.

7. Best Interests Factors
7.1 In support of modification Petitioner will show that maintaining the prior 50/50 schedule is no longer in the child’s best interests because it exposes the child to an unjustified safety risk. Modification to a primary custody arrangement with safety-based parenting time preserves the child’s relationship with Respondent while protecting the child from foreseeable harm.
7.2 Petitioner will ask the Court to consider all applicable statutory and case law factors governing child custody and the modification standard, including the statutory mandate that the child’s best interests and welfare govern custody and parenting-time decisions.

8. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:
   1. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Court’s March 12, 2019 order;
   2. Modify the Existing Order to award primary physical custody of Sophia Smith to Petitioner, Emily Johnson;
   3. Establish Respondent’s parenting time on a schedule and under conditions consistent with the child’s safety (which may include supervised or assisted visits, limited duration visits, or other reasonable conditions as the Court deems appropriate), and require Respondent to comply with any recommended safety measures or medical restrictions pertaining to parenting;
   4. Enter a temporary pendente lite order awarding primary physical custody to Petitioner pending final hearing and ordering temporary supervised or restricted visitation for Respondent until the Court orders otherwise;
   5. Order a medical/functional assessment of Respondent and such home evaluations, guardian ad litem appointment, or other evaluations as the Court deems appropriate;
   6. Order production of relevant medical records and other documentation and schedule an expedited hearing; and
   7. Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

9. Notice and Certification
9.1 Petitioner certifies that this Complaint is filed in good faith and that the facts alleged herein are true to the best of Petitioner’s knowledge and belief.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Representative)
Statutes, rules, and authorities governing custody modification and child welfare in Massachusetts include, among others:

- Massachusetts caselaw recognizing the need for modification upon a material change in circumstances and directing courts to decide custody based on the best interests and welfare of the child (authorities to be relied upon and supplemented at hearing).

Petitioner will rely on and cite additional Massachusetts cases and authorities at hearing to support the claim that the facts alleged above constitute a material change in circumstances affecting custody and parenting time and warrant the requested relief.
