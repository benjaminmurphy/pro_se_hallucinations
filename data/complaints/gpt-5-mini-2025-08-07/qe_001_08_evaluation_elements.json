    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges a residential tenancy and identifies Defendant as the owner/landlord and Plaintiff as a tenant who began renting on or about July 1, 2022 under a periodic/monthly tenancy and paying $2,200/mo (\u00b63\u20135). Those facts adequately plead the landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges affirmative acts (sending a repair person on at least two occasions) and, more importantly, omissions (declining to provide a permanent repair or meaningful remedial efforts despite notice) by Defendant (\u00b63, \u00b67\u20139, \u00b612). Those factual allegations sufficiently plead landlord conduct (acts and failures to act)."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges repeated, intermittent drops in indoor temperature to approximately 60\u00b0F for several hours, creating cold, uncomfortable and at times unsafe living conditions, and expressly alleges these conditions \u2018\u2018substantially interfered\u2019\u2019 with Plaintiff\u2019s use and enjoyment (\u00b66, \u00b611, \u00b613, \u00b617\u201318). It also alleges concrete effects (illness, increased utility use) that support a claim of substantial interference. "
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint links the heating failures and resulting harms to Defendant\u2019s conduct by alleging Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant, Defendant authorized but did not effectuate durable repairs, and Defendant refused to provide a permanent remedy despite knowing of the problem (\u00b67\u20139, \u00b612, \u00b617, \u00b620). Those allegations sufficiently trace the interference to the landlord\u2019s acts/omissions. "
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint pleads specific economic damages (increased electricity bills ~ $150/month for space heaters (\u00b610, \u00b619(a)); out\u2011of\u2011pocket medical expenses and three days\u2019 lost wages from bronchitis (\u00b611, \u00b619(b)); and general inconvenience and loss of use (\u00b619(c))). It also states a present damages total ($1,200) and reserves the right to amend (\u00b621). Those allegations adequately plead damages."
