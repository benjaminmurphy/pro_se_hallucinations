    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. Complaint states Plaintiff is a tenant at 45 Maple Street, Defendant is the owner/landlord of that same premises, and plaintiff pays monthly rent ($1,200) (see \u00b6\u00b61.1, 1.2, 3.1). These facts establish the landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. Complaint alleges Defendant was notified of the hot\u2011water failure, told Plaintiff he ordered a replacement part, but failed to restore hot water over the relevant period (see \u00b6\u00b63.2\u20133.6, 3.8). This is an omission/failure to repair within the landlord's control."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. Complaint alleges an extended (\u22483 week) loss of an essential service (hot water) and factual effects: inability to take hot showers, inability to safely bathe an infant, paying for gym membership and gas, and using Plaintiff's mother's home for bathing (see \u00b6\u00b63.6\u20133.7). Those facts plausibly plead a material/substantial interference with use and enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. Complaint links Defendant's conduct/omission (failure to obtain/replace the part and restore hot water after notice) to the resulting loss of hot water and the injuries/expenses claimed (see \u00b6\u00b63.2\u20133.6, 3.8\u20133.9, 4.4). It alleges the landlord had control over the repair, giving rise to proximate causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Adequately alleged. Complaint identifies out\u2011of\u2011pocket expenses and consequential losses (gym fees, gas, other expenses and an estimated damage amount of at least $400) and requests compensatory damages (see \u00b6\u00b63.7, 3.9, 5.1)."
