  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a residential tenancy beginning Jan 1, 2022, that Plaintiff pays $1,500/month in rent, and that Defendant is the owner and landlord of 12 Maple Street (\u00b6\u00b62\u20134). These factual allegations adequately plead a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges multiple landlord actions and omissions: Plaintiff notified Defendant of inadequate heat, Defendant arranged two repair visits but did not effect a lasting repair, the technician said the boiler was 'old but functional,' and Defendant has refused to replace or permanently fix the system and insists the heat is 'working' (\u00b6\u00b66\u201310, 13, 18). These are sufficient factual allegations of acts/omissions by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges repeated, predictable drops in indoor temperature to roughly 60\u00b0F for several hours (\u00b66, \u00b68\u201310), that this materially interfered with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment (\u00b610, \u00b617\u201318), and resulting consequences (purchase/use of space heaters, higher bills, illness, missed work) (\u00b611\u201312, \u00b614). Those facts adequately plead a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint links the interference to Defendant's conduct: Plaintiff gave notice and Defendant's repairs failed to cure the recurring inadequate heat, and Defendant declined to perform permanent repairs or replacement, which allowed the intermittent low temperatures to continue (\u00b67\u201310, \u00b613, \u00b617\u201318). Those allegations sufficiently plead that the landlord's acts/omissions caused the interference."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete damages: increased electric bills (~$150/month) from space heaters (\u00b611), out-of-pocket medical expenses and prescription costs and three days of missed work due to bronchitis (\u00b612), and an overall damages estimate of $600 (\u00b614, \u00b619). These factual allegations adequately plead damages."
