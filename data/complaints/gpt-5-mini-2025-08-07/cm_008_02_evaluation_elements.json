    "existing_custody_order": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges a prior custody order entered May 15, 2022 (\u00b62.1, \u00b63.1) awarding shared legal custody, naming Plaintiff as the primary residential parent and granting Defendant substantial weekend parenting time including Sunday overnights."
    },
    "specific_modification_sought": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint identifies specific relief (\u00b66.2\u20136.6): grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority over school attendance and routine educational decisions; eliminate or restrict Sunday overnight parenting time (or overnights immediately prior to a school day); require advance notice and medical documentation for absences; require Defendant to cooperate with tutoring/transportation; and seek temporary relief pending a hearing."
    },
    "material_substantial_change": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint pleads specific factual changes since the prior order (\u00b64.2\u20134.6): repeated Monday school absences after Defendant's weekend time without medical documentation or verification, Defendant's refusal to provide records or to transport the child to tutoring, resulting truancy warnings to Plaintiff, and a documented decline in grades and standardized test scores over the past year. Those allegations, together with the alleged risk of continuing educational harm (\u00b64.7, \u00b65.3), sufficiently allege a material and substantial change in circumstances."
    },
    "best_interests_of_child": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint links the alleged changes to the child's welfare and requests modifications aimed at preventing ongoing educational harm (\u00b64.6\u20134.7, \u00b65.3, \u00b66.2\u20136.6). The asserted decline in academic performance, truancy warnings, and requested remedies tailored to restore school attendance and supports are pleaded as necessary for the child's best interests."
