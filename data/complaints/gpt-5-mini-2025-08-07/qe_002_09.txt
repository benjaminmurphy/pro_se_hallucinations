v.

    Defendant.                              

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jordan Harris ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Linda Smith ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Harris is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Defendant Linda Smith is the owner and landlord of the residential property and basement rental unit located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts 02119.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 and the court’s jurisdiction over landlord-tenant matters and housing code enforcement. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the rental premises are located in Roxbury, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff leased a basement apartment at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, beginning March 1, 2022, and continued as a tenant through the date of this complaint.

5. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00. Plaintiff has generally paid rent on time; Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late with the October 2025 rent payment due to medical bills, and Plaintiff thereafter paid the full rent and the landlord’s contractual late fee.

6. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff observed water seeping into the basement unit through the basement wall when it rained heavily. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message and communicated the problem to Defendant, who responded that she would "look into it."

7. Several weeks passed with no repairs or remediation by Defendant. The water infiltration continued and worsened during subsequent heavy rains. The water damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf located against the affected wall. The monetary loss to Plaintiff’s personal property is approximately $400.00.

8. As a result of the ongoing water infiltration and associated dampness, Plaintiff has had to operate a dehumidifier continuously to attempt to keep the unit dry, causing increased electricity usage and increased utility costs.

9. Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston to report the water infiltration and related conditions. City inspectors visited the property, observed water infiltration through the basement wall and other code violations, and cited defects covered by the State Sanitary Code and local housing codes.

10. Defendant has failed and refused to repair the basement wall or otherwise abate the water intrusion and related conditions despite having been notified by Plaintiff and having been put on notice by the municipal inspection.

11. Within the past several weeks, Defendant declared Plaintiff a "problem tenant" and informed Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026. Defendant cites Plaintiff’s single, brief late rent payment in October as the reason for nonrenewal. The timing of Defendant’s adverse actions follows closely on the heels of the municipal inspection and is suspicious and retaliatory in context.

12. Defendant’s failure to repair the habitable condition of the premises and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of the premises by allowing persistent water intrusion, damage to Plaintiff’s possessions, increased electrical costs for continuous dehumidification, and threats of nonrenewal (in the wake of Plaintiff’s reporting of code violations) constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential tenancy under Massachusetts law.

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (COMMON LAW)

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 above.

14. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes a tenant the right to quiet enjoyment of leased premises and has an implied obligation not to permit conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071, 1077–78 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential leases); see also State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

15. The landlord’s obligations to keep premises fit for human habitation and to remedy housing code violations are embodied in Massachusetts statutory and regulatory law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, and State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant provisions).

16. A landlord’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when the landlord's acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises — including the landlord’s failure to repair conditions that cause water infiltration, dampness, damage to possessions, or create an unsafe or uninhabitable environment. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); see also 105 CMR 410.000.

17. Defendant’s failure to make timely repairs to a known chronic water infiltration through the basement wall, the resulting flooding/dampness, the damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, the increased utility costs caused by continuous dehumidifier operation, and the threatened nonrenewal of the lease following Plaintiff’s complaints and a municipal inspection constitute substantial interferences with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and use of the rental premises and therefore breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered ascertainable damages consisting of property damage, increased utility costs, diminution in the use and enjoyment of the premises, emotional distress and inconvenience, and attorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket property damage is approximately $400. Plaintiff reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial.
