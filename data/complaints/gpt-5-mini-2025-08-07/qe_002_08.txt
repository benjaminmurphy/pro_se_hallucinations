COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Samantha Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Tenant”) is a natural person and a resident of Roxbury, Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides in the basement apartment at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Linda Carver (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the Premises and may be served at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.

3. Plaintiff entered into tenancy of the Premises beginning March 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and because the Premises are located in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts law governing summary process and landlord-tenant disputes and the location of the real property.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the basement unit at 27 Maple Street since March 1, 2022, and has paid rent in the amount of $1,200 per month.

6. In October 2025, Plaintiff fell approximately two weeks behind in rent due to medical bills. Plaintiff subsequently paid the full outstanding rent together with any late fee imposed by Defendant, resolving the late-payment issue.

7. In November 2025, Plaintiff observed water seeping through the basement wall of the Premises during heavy rainstorms. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message and requested that Defendant investigate and repair the water infiltration.

8. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but did not timely procure repairs or remedial measures to stop the water infiltration.

9. After several weeks without remediation by Defendant, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston housing/code inspection services. A municipal inspector visited the Premises, observed the water infiltration during rain and other code violations related to the condition of the basement unit, and noted the need for repair and remediation.

10. The water infiltration has caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf set against the affected basement wall. Plaintiff estimates that the damage to personal property totals approximately $400.00.

11. Because of persistent dampness and to protect her personal items and health, Plaintiff has run a dehumidifier in the basement unit continuously since the water infiltration began, resulting in increased electricity usage and higher utility costs.

12. Defendant has not completed repairs to stop water entry and has taken no adequate remedial action to remedy the hazardous and damaging condition in the basement unit.

13. Following the municipal inspection and inspection report, Defendant has publicly and privately described Plaintiff to others as a “problem tenant,” and has informed Plaintiff that Defendant will not renew the lease when it expires in March 2026. Defendant has told Plaintiff that the nonrenewal is because of the October late rent incident and has otherwise referred to the inspection and Plaintiff’s complaint or calls to the city in a derogatory fashion to justify nonrenewal.

14. Plaintiff reasonably believes and alleges that Defendant’s stated reason for not renewing the lease (the October late rent) is pretextual and that Defendant’s adverse actions are, at least in part, in retaliation for Plaintiff’s contacting the City for an inspection and asserting habitability and code concerns.

15. Defendant’s failure to timely investigate and repair the water infiltration, Defendant’s comments and actions threatening nonrenewal and branding Plaintiff a “problem tenant,” and the continued presence of water infiltration have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. The condition is persistent and ongoing.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law, Massachusetts)

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts common law, every residential tenancy carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment: the tenant shall have the right to possession and use of the premises without substantial interference by the landlord or third parties acting at the landlord’s behest. The covenant is breached when the landlord’s conduct substantially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises.

18. Defendant by failing to repair and abate ongoing water infiltration and by creating a hostile and retaliatory rental environment has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

19. Defendant’s conduct — including failing to act following actual knowledge of the water infiltration (by Plaintiff’s notice and by municipal inspection), allowing conditions to persist that damaged Plaintiff’s personal property and created ongoing dampness and need for a dehumidifier, and communicating an intent not to renew the lease in connection with the inspection and with Plaintiff’s complaints — constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including: (a) damage to personal property in the approximate amount of $400.00; (b) increased utility expenses for continuous dehumidifier operation; (c) loss of the benefit of the bargain in terms of habitable, dry premises; (d) emotional distress and inconvenience; and (e) the probable loss of housing security due to Defendant’s stated intent not to renew the lease in suspicious and retaliatory circumstances.

21. Plaintiff has performed all obligations required of her under the lease (including payment of rent), except for the temporary late payment in October 2025, which was paid in full with any fees. Any asserted default by Plaintiff cannot excuse Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, particularly where Defendant’s adverse actions are connected to Plaintiff’s protected complaints to the city regarding housing conditions.

22. Plaintiff seeks relief for compensatory damages, and any other relief to which Plaintiff is entitled under Massachusetts law.

APPLICABLE LAW (Representative Statutes and Regulations)

Plaintiff relies on, and gives notice of, the relevance of the following Massachusetts statutes and regulations and the legal principles they reflect (non-exhaustive):

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes), including sections addressing landlord and tenant obligations, retaliatory conduct, and related remedies;
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process statutes governing landlord-tenant proceedings);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §§ 127A and 127I (statutory authority for the State Sanitary Code and local inspection/enforcement);
- State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) and related regulations;
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2 (prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, where applicable);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 15B (security deposit rules and landlord obligations in residential tenancies);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 18 (statutory protection against retaliatory eviction or actions, and related remedies);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239, § 8A (procedures and tenant defenses in summary process actions, including claims arising from landlord conduct);
- Any and all local ordinances and codes of the City of Boston pertaining to housing and building safety and enforcement.

(As detailed factual and legal development proceeds and discovery occurs, Plaintiff will rely on controlling Massachusetts caselaw interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment, retaliatory eviction doctrine, and remedies for breach of the covenant.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages to Plaintiff for injury to personal property in the amount of $400.00, and for other direct economic damages (including increased utility costs) in an amount to be proven at trial;

B. Award additional general damages for loss of use and benefit of the premises, emotional distress, inconvenience, and any other non-economic damages allowed by law, in an amount to be proven at trial;

C. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. Order an injunction or other equitable relief requiring Defendant promptly to repair the water infiltration and remediate the basement unit so the Premises conform to the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000, and to abate the hazardous condition;

E. Declare that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

F. Award costs of suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees if authorized by applicable statute or law, and any other statutory remedies that may be available to Plaintiff;

G. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all claims so triable.
