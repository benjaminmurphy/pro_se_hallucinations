COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Carlos Martinez ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Thomas Reed ("Defendant") is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Springfield, Massachusetts and at all relevant times resided next door to Plaintiff and shared the driveway at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

3. Venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court pursuant to the Massachusetts venue statutes because the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Hampden County and Defendant resides in Hampden County.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.

FACTS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who each occupy separate units in a duplex and share a common driveway located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

6. Defendant kept a tall aluminum extension ladder propped and leaning against the wooden fence that runs along the shared driveway, adjacent to the area where Plaintiff routinely parked and backed his vehicle.

7. Plaintiff, on multiple occasions prior to the incident, told Defendant that the ladder was unsecured, that it worried Plaintiff that it might fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, and that wind could tip the ladder over. Defendant acknowledged those statements and said he would tie the ladder down or otherwise secure or move it, but Defendant failed to do so.

8. On or about March 15, 2023, during a windy day, Plaintiff was backing his vehicle into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street.

9. A gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder that Defendant had left propped against the fence to tip over and fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking the hood and the windshield.

10. As a direct result, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained damage to the hood and a cracked windshield. The vehicle remained operable, but required bodywork and windshield replacement.

11. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses including, but not limited to, the vehicle insurance deductible and costs of renting a replacement vehicle for more than a week while his vehicle was being repaired.

12. Plaintiff has sustained property damage and related consequential economic losses as a result of Defendant’s conduct.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Negligence

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff and other foreseeable persons using the shared driveway a duty to exercise reasonable care in storing, securing, and maintaining items on or adjacent to the shared driveway in a manner that would not create an unreasonable risk of harm or damage to persons or property.

15. Defendant breached that duty by negligently leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder unsecured and propped against the wooden fence adjacent to the driveway, despite being on notice from Plaintiff that the ladder posed a risk and that Defendant had promised to secure or move it.

16. Defendant’s failure to secure or move the ladder was negligent because a reasonably prudent person in Defendant’s position would have recognized the risk and taken reasonable steps to secure, move, or otherwise prevent the ladder from falling.

17. The foreseeable and natural consequence of Defendant’s breach was that the unsecured ladder could fall in windy conditions and strike vehicles or persons using the driveway. The ladder did, in fact, fall and strike Plaintiff’s vehicle.

18. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle and the consequential expenses Plaintiff incurred.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including property damage to his vehicle, expenses for repair and windshield replacement, insurance deductible payments, rental-car expenses while his vehicle was repaired, and other damages to be proven at trial.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF — NEGLIGENCE
(Elements: duty, breach, causation, damages)

20. Plaintiff restates and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 19.

21. Defendant had a legal duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage and maintenance of the ladder on property adjoining the shared driveway.

22. Defendant breached that duty by failing to secure or remove the ladder after being warned of the risk.

23. Defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s vehicle damage and related economic losses.

24. Plaintiff suffered actual, compensable damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

25. Plaintiff brings this action within the time allowed by Massachusetts law for tort actions. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A, actions of tort for personal injury or property damage must be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues. The subject incident occurred on March 15, 2023; this Complaint is filed within the statutory period.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Carlos Martinez respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Thomas Reed as follows:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to: costs of repairs to the vehicle (including hood repair and windshield replacement), insurance deductible(s) paid by Plaintiff, rental vehicle expenses and other reasonable transportation expenses incurred while Plaintiff’s vehicle was being repaired, and any other economic losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence;

B. Costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees if authorized by law;

C. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
