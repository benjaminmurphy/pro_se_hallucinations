      "support_reasoning": "The case is a California Supreme Court decision establishing an implied warranty of habitability and discussing constructive eviction/quiet enjoyment principles largely under California law and general common law, not Massachusetts law. While it cites and briefly describes Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway (a Massachusetts case) and notes that court\u2019s recognition of an implied warranty of habitability, this opinion itself does not articulate Massachusetts\u2019 covenant of quiet enjoyment standards or specifically address a landlord\u2019s duty under Massachusetts law regarding pest infestations. Thus it cannot be relied on as direct authority for the detailed Massachusetts-law proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe Supreme Court of Wisconsin was the first to adopt this approach in 1961, and since 1969 the Supreme Courts of Hawaii, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Illinois, Iowa, and Massachusetts and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have followed this lead. [fn. 12] \u2026 Moreover, lower courts in several additional states have also recently recognized the existence of an implied warranty of habitability.\u201d (10 Cal.3d at 628.)"

      "supports_proposition": true,
      "support_confidence": "medium",
      "support_reasoning": "The case adopts an implied warranty of habitability and holds that substantial defects affecting health and safety (including conditions like sewage, leaks, inoperable toilet, and threats to safety) constitute a breach of the landlord\u2019s obligations and justify tenant damages, including reimbursement of rent and additional compensatory damages, and potentially punitive damages. While the opinion does not specifically discuss insect or rodent infestations or injunctive relief, it expressly recognizes that conditions such as infestations and similar substantial interferences fall within the scope of habitability breaches warranting damages. Thus it generally supports the broader proposition that substantial interferences, negligently or intentionally not abated, can justify tenant remedies.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Damages for annoyance and discomfort are reasonable in light of the fact that\n\n  \"the residential tenant who has suffered a breach of the warranty . . . cannot bathe as frequently as he would like or at all if there is inadequate hot water; he must worry about rodents harassing his children or spreading disease if the premises are infested; or he must avoid certain rooms or worry about catching a cold if there is inadequate weather protection or heat. Thus, discomfort and annoyance are the common injuries caused by each breach . . . .\""
