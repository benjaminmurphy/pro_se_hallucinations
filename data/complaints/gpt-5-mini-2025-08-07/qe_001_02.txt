COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Emily Thompson ("Plaintiff"), pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Jordan Smith ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is a natural person residing at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

2. Defendant is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the "Premises") and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

3. Plaintiff is the tenant of the Premises under a residential tenancy that began on January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $1,500.00 per month in rent to Defendant.

4. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, because the Premises is located in Dorchester and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Dorchester.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

6. During the winter of 2024–2025, and continuing intermittently thereafter, the heating system serving Plaintiff's apartment repeatedly failed to maintain reasonable, comfortable indoor temperatures. The heat did not fail completely, but indoor temperatures would drop to roughly 60° F for several hours at a time, typically in the evenings.

7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the inadequate heat on multiple occasions. In response, Defendant arranged for a repair technician to visit the Premises on two separate occasions.

8. After the first repair visit, the heating operated more reliably for approximately one week, after which the same problems (periodic drops in temperature to roughly 60° F) recurred.

9. After the second repair visit, the technician informed Plaintiff that the building's boiler was "old but functional" and indicated that there was little more that could be done without significant replacement or refurbishment.

10. Although Defendant arranged for repairs, the heating problems were not resolved and the intermittent lack of adequate heat continued. Defendant has maintained that the heat is "working" because the heat never goes completely off and the building is not frozen, notwithstanding the repeated and predictable drops in indoor temperature that materially interfered with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the Premises.

11. Because of the recurring inadequate heat, Plaintiff purchased and used two portable electric space heaters to maintain a reasonable and safe indoor temperature. Plaintiff's electric bills increased by approximately $150.00 per month while using the space heaters.

12. In January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis. Plaintiff's treating physician advised that the cold indoor air and the apartment's intermittent low temperatures probably contributed to or exacerbated the respiratory illness. Plaintiff missed three days of work as a result of the illness and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses including a prescription antibiotic.

13. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant perform effective and permanent repairs or, if necessary, replace the building heating equipment. Defendant has not done so.

14. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a result of Defendant's actions and omissions, including but not limited to increased utility costs (approximately $150.00 per month), out-of-pocket medical and pharmaceutical expenses, lost wages for missed work, and loss of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises. On the basis of the foregoing, Plaintiff reasonably estimates total damages at $600.00, exclusive of costs, interest and fees.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, every lease (express or implied) contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under which a landlord must not substantially interfere with a tenant's use and enjoyment of the leased premises. A landlord breaches that covenant when the landlord's actions or omissions render the premises unfit for ordinary residential use or otherwise materially deprive the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and related protections for tenants); see also relevant Massachusetts authorities and regulatory standards cited below.

17. Defendant's repeated failure to provide adequate and continuous heat, and Defendant's failure to make effective, lasting repairs to the heating system despite notice and opportunity to do so, substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff's quiet and comfortable use and enjoyment of the Premises.

18. Defendant's conduct in (a) allowing the heating system to continue operating in a manner that permitted repeated drops in indoor temperature to roughly 60° F for several hours; (b) making only intermittent, inadequate repairs that did not address the recurrent problem; and (c) insisting that the heat was "working" despite repeated complaints and the resulting harm to Plaintiff, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer actual damages, including increased utility bills for space heaters, medical expenses and prescription costs, lost wages, and loss of full use and enjoyment of the Premises.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon the following statutory and regulatory provisions and authorities in support of the foregoing claim (representative, non-exhaustive list):

Statutes and Regulations
- Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111 (Public Health) and statutory authority for the State Sanitary Code.
- M.G.L. c. 111, § 127A (authority for minimum standards of fitness for human habitation and enforcement).
- Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), including applicable provisions addressing heating and hot water (see generally 105 CMR 410.100–410.200).
- Massachusetts landlord-tenant statutory provisions governing tenancies, habitability, and related matters, including M.G.L. c. 186 (general provisions relating to landlord-tenant law).
- Applicable local housing codes and the enforcement authority of local boards of health (City of Boston/Dorchester).

Representative Case Law and Authorities
- Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant protections and habitability implications under lease law).
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (recognizing warranty of habitability principles).
- Cases and authorities acknowledging that substantial interference with fundamental facilities (including heat) may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment or similar landlord obligations under residential leases.
- Massachusetts Superior and Appellate decisions construing landlord obligations, implied covenants, and the interplay between statutory sanitary code standards and lease obligations (see, e.g., authorities interpreting 105 CMR 410.000 and M.G.L. c. 111).

Plaintiff will rely on these and other applicable statutes, regulations, and case law at trial and in support of motions and briefing as necessary.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), or such other amount as the Court finds fair and just to compensate Plaintiff for increased utility costs, medical expenses, lost wages, and loss of use and enjoyment;

B. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award costs of suit, including filing fees and service costs;

D. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including any injunctive relief required to ensure that Defendant promptly and adequately repairs or replaces the heating system so that the Premises conform to applicable heat and habitability standards; and

E. Award any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Emily Thompson
