v.                                                      Docket No.: ____________

David Robinson
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Emily Robinson, pro se, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com. Petitioner is the primary physical custodian of the minor children named below and is a resident of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

1.2 Respondent: David Robinson, the other parent of the children named below, whose address is on file with the Court.

1.3 Children: The modification sought concerns the custody and care of the parties’ minor children:
     - Liam Robinson, born 2015 (age 10)
     - Ava Robinson, born 2017 (age 8)

1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to applicable Massachusetts statutes governing child custody and family matters, including the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, M.G.L. c. 209B, and relevant provisions governing modification of custody orders in Massachusetts (see, e.g., M.G.L. c. 208 and related statutory and case law). Venue in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court is proper because the children primarily reside in Norfolk County and the existing custody order was entered in this Court.

2. Existing Order
2.1 On May 15, 2022, this Court entered a custody and parenting-time order awarding the parties shared legal custody of the children, with the children primarily residing with Petitioner and Respondent having regular scheduled visitation (every-other-weekend parenting time). The order further included mutual obligations to support the relationship of each child with the other parent and to refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children.

3. Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Petitioner seeks modification of the prior order based upon a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2022 order that affects the best interests of the children.

3.2 Specific factual allegations establishing a material change in circumstances:

     a) Over the past year, Respondent has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities or obligations that occur during Petitioner’s scheduled parenting time without first consulting Petitioner or seeking the parties’ agreed scheduling accommodations, thereby disrupting Petitioner’s court-ordered time with the children and causing conflict and instability in the children’s schedule.

     b) Respondent has, on multiple occasions, told the children that it is Petitioner’s fault when activities conflict with Petitioner’s parenting time and has used disparaging language directed at Petitioner in the presence of the children. The children have reported that Respondent calls Petitioner “selfish” and tells them “you don’t really love them” when Petitioner asks to swap parenting time.

     c) As a result of the above-described conduct, at least one child (Liam) has experienced recurring psychosomatic symptoms (stomach aches) on transition days, which symptoms have been reported to be new within the last year and which appear temporally connected to transitions between households and the ongoing parental conflict.

     d) The pattern described above is ongoing, was not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2022 order, and is affecting the children’s emotional well-being, stability, and adjustment.

3.3 The conduct described in Paragraph 3.2 constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the custody and parenting-time provisions of the May 15, 2022 order in order to protect and promote the children’s best interests.

4. Legal Standard
4.1 Modification of a prior custody or parenting-time order is appropriate where there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order that warrants reconsideration of custody and/or primary residence in light of the children’s best interests. In deciding a modification petition, the Court must consider the best interests of the child, giving primary weight to stability and the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs, including the impact of parental conflict on the child. (See applicable Massachusetts statutory and case law interpreting the standard for modification and best interests as set forth in M.G.L. c. 208 and related authorities, and as articulated in controlling decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court.)

4.2 Petitioner respectfully submits that the facts alleged above demonstrate such a material change (unilateral scheduling decisions causing conflict and disparagement in the presence of the children; demonstrable emotional/physical reactions in a child) and that a modification in the custody arrangement is necessary to serve the children’s best interests.

5. Relief Requested
Petitioner therefore respectfully requests that the Court enter an order as follows:

5.1 Primary Physical Custody: Modify the 5/15/2022 custody order to award primary physical custody of Liam and Ava to Petitioner, Emily Robinson, with parenting time to Respondent to be structured as follows (or in a manner ordered by the Court consistent with the best interests of the children):

     a) A detailed parenting-time schedule that preserves stability for the children and minimizes disruptive transitions, such as: the current every-other-weekend schedule with certain weekday overnights as appropriate to maintain the children’s relationship with Respondent, or other schedule the Court deems appropriate; AND

     b) Implementation of a transition protocol (e.g., specified drop-off/pick-up times and locations, length of transition time) designed to reduce stress for the children.

5.2 Decision-Making Authority / Scheduling Rules: Clarify and set forth rules governing scheduling decisions for extracurricular activities, including but not limited to:

     a) Major scheduling decisions for the children’s activities (e.g., seasonal sports, lessons, camps, extended commitments) shall be communicated in writing to the other parent at least 14 days in advance (or as practicable) and require mutual agreement; if agreement cannot be reached within 7 days, the matter shall be referred to a neutral process (Court-facilitated telephone conference or expedited mediation) for resolution before the activity is finalized insofar as practical and in the children’s best interests.

     b) A prohibition on unilateral enrollment in activities that would directly conflict with the other parent’s scheduled parenting time without prior written agreement, except in genuine emergency circumstances.

5.3 Parental Conduct / No-Disparagement: Order that both parents refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children and from attempting to turn the children against the other parent; the Court should find that such conduct is harmful to the children and enjoin such conduct moving forward.

5.4 Therapeutic / Supportive Measures: For the protection and support of the children’s emotional health, order one or more of the following as the Court deems appropriate:

     a) Court-referred family or individual counseling for the children, specifically to assess and address transition-related symptoms; and

     b) Participation in a co-parenting program or education class by both parents (or by Respondent alone if the Court deems appropriate) to learn constructive co-parenting and communication strategies and to reduce conflict in the presence of the children.

5.5 Communication Protocol: Order the parents to use a neutral parenting communication tool (e.g., OurFamilyWizard or comparable shared parenting app) for scheduling and communications concerning the children, and limit direct disparaging communications through texts/phone calls in front of the children.

5.6 Further Relief: Grant any other temporary, interim, and final relief that the Court deems just and equitable to protect the children’s best interests and to effectuate the Court’s custody and parenting-time authority.

6. Basis in Law
6.1 Petitioner relies upon the Massachusetts statutes and authorities governing child custody and modification, including without limitation:
     - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act);
     - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and related provisions addressing custody and parental rights and obligations;
     - Statutory and decisional law setting forth the “best interests of the child” standard and the standards for modification of custody orders.

6.2 Petitioner further relies upon controlling Massachusetts case law interpreting the standard for custody determination and modification and the Court’s authority to enter orders to protect the children’s welfare, including decisions addressing material change in circumstances, the children’s best interests, the harmful effect of parental disparagement and alienating behavior, and the Court’s authority to structure parenting time and decision-making to reduce conflict and promote stability. Petitioner invokes the Court’s equitable authority to order remedial measures (parenting education, counseling, communication protocols) when parental conduct undermines the children’s welfare.

(For the Court’s convenience, Petitioner refers to controlling Massachusetts authority on custody modification and best-interests analysis, and requests the Court apply the relevant statutory provisions and published SJC/Appeals Court decisions addressing those standards.)

7. Certification and Request for Hearing
7.1 Petitioner requests that the Court schedule a hearing on this Complaint at the Court’s earliest convenience. Petitioner is prepared to present evidence, including testimony from the children (if the Court deems appropriate), documentary evidence of communications and scheduling conflicts, and any expert testimony the Court requires regarding the children’s emotional well-being.

7.2 Petitioner certifies under the penalties of perjury that the statements in this Complaint are true to the best of her knowledge and belief.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:

     a) Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2022 custody order,
     b) Modify the custodial arrangement to award primary physical custody to Petitioner (or otherwise as the Court determines appropriate in the children’s best interests),
     c) Clarify and set forth rules for scheduling decisions and prohibiting unilateral enrollment in activities conflicting with scheduled parenting time,
     d) Order remedial measures including counseling and co-parenting education as the Court finds appropriate,
     e) Order all other relief that the Court deems just and equitable to protect the children’s best interests.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
