COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harrington (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and tenant who resides at 123 Main Street, Apartment __, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Thomas B. Mitchell (“Defendant”) is the landlord and owner (or agent of the owner) of the residential building located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, where Plaintiff rents an apartment.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy under which Plaintiff began renting the apartment on June 1, 2021, and pays monthly rent of $1,500.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts rules governing summary process and landlord-tenant claims and general subject-matter jurisdiction (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186), and venue properly lies in Chelsea District Court because the rental premises are located in Chelsea.

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–4 as though set forth fully herein.

6. For at least the past two months prior to the filing of this complaint, the main entry door to the building at 123 Main Street has had a broken lock that does not latch properly; the door can be pushed open without use of a key.

7. Plaintiff notified Defendant about the broken lock approximately two months ago and requested repair. Defendant acknowledged the request and stated he would fix the lock but thereafter took no steps to repair it.

8. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the need to repair the lock on at least two subsequent occasions. Defendant responded dismissively (e.g., saying Plaintiff was “overreacting” and that the neighborhood was safe) but did not arrange for repairs.

9. Last month, an individual entered the building through the defective main entry door and went through residents’ mail and packages in the common hallway. Multiple residents, including Plaintiff, suffered thefts of packages left in the common hallway.

10. Plaintiff’s package was taken from the hallway and had a retail value of approximately $120.

11. In addition, Plaintiff has observed evidence that someone has been sleeping in the building basement, indicating unauthorized access to the building and a threat to tenants’ safety and security.

12. Concerned for her personal safety and the security of her possessions, Plaintiff purchased and installed (on her own apartment door) a security camera and upgraded her own deadbolt at a cost of approximately $200.

13. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the broken main entry lock and to secure the premises has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rented apartment and the common areas of the building, has created an unreasonable risk to her safety and to her possessions, and has resulted in actual monetary loss and expense to Plaintiff.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff claims damages in the amount of $320 (the sum of $120 for the stolen package and $200 for the security camera and deadbolt), together with costs and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

III. CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–14 as though set forth fully herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, every tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in a lease or tenancy, which guarantees that the tenant’s possession, use and enjoyment of the leased premises will not be substantially and materially disturbed by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code – Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); and Massachusetts case law recognizing the landlord’s duty to prevent material interference with tenants’ enjoyment of their premises.

17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment includes a landlord’s obligation to maintain reasonably safe and secure common areas and building entrances, and to remedy defects in building security which the landlord knows or reasonably should know about, when a tenant’s peaceful possession, personal safety, or property is at risk. See, e.g., common law principles embodied in Massachusetts decisions and treatises recognizing the landlord’s duty to prevent foreseeable interferences with tenant possession and enjoyment.

18. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by (a) failing to repair the building’s main entry lock after being notified of the defect, (b) failing to take reasonable measures to secure the building after being put on notice of unauthorized access and package thefts, and (c) dismissing Plaintiff’s reasonable safety concerns rather than taking remedial action.

19. Defendant’s breach proximately caused Plaintiff to suffer actual damages — theft of a package valued at approximately $120, and out-of-pocket expenditures of approximately $200 for a security camera and a new deadbolt — and has caused Plaintiff emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of the full benefit of her tenancy.

20. Plaintiff has performed all conditions required of her under the tenancy or they have been excused by Defendant’s breach.

IV. DAMAGES

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered special damages in the amount of $320 (one hundred twenty dollars for the stolen package and two hundred dollars for the security camera and upgraded deadbolt).

22. Plaintiff also seeks general damages for loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and any other damages permitted by law, in an amount proven at trial.

V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in the amount of at least $320 for Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket losses caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, together with additional general damages in an amount to be determined at trial for loss of use and enjoyment and emotional distress;

B. For costs of suit and reasonable post-judgment interest to the extent allowed by law;

C. For any other relief this Court deems just and proper, including injunctive relief ordering Defendant to repair and secure the main entry door and to take reasonable measures to secure the building common areas to prevent unauthorized entry and thefts; and

D. For such further relief as the Court may deem equitable and proper.
