It does not address landlord\u2013tenant law, common areas of a building, or any specific duty of a landlord/manager to maintain, inspect, repair, or warn of dangerous conditions in common areas. Using Palsgraf to support a landlord\u2019s premises-liability duty is therefore inapposite and misaligned with the specific proposition stated.",
