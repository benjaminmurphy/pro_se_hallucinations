Kyle Miller

Docket No. ____________________

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Capacity
   1.1. Plaintiff: Jessica Thompson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant: Kyle Miller, other parent of the minor children listed below, residing in Massachusetts (address on file with the Court).
   1.3. Minor children subject to this action:
        - Emma Thompson, born 2015 (age 10)
        - Noah Thompson, born 2017 (age 8)

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1. This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes governing custody and modification of custody orders, including M.G.L. c. 208 and M.G.L. c. 209C, and the inherent authority of this Court to enter orders in the best interests of the children.
   2.2. Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the minor children reside primarily in this county and the prior custody order was entered in this jurisdiction.

3. Procedural History and Existing Order
   3.1. On May 15, 2022, this Court entered a custody order providing that the parties share joint legal custody of Emma and Noah, with the children primarily residing with Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and visiting Defendant, Kyle Miller, on an every-other-weekend schedule. The order includes directives that the parties shall support the children's relationship with each parent and shall not disparage one another in the presence of the children.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   4.1. Plaintiff alleges that since entry of the May 15, 2022 custody order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children such that modification of the custody arrangement is warranted.
   4.2. Specific facts demonstrating a material change in circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:
        a) Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities scheduled during Plaintiff's previously-ordered weekends with the children without prior discussion or agreement from Plaintiff.
        b) Defendant has represented to the children that any inability to attend or participate in those activities is Plaintiff's fault and has told the children that Plaintiff is "selfish" and that Plaintiff "doesn't really love them" when Plaintiff makes a reasonable request to swap weekends to avoid scheduling conflicts.
        c) The children have communicated to Plaintiff that Defendant has said the foregoing disparaging statements, and the children have exhibited emotional distress related to transitions between households.
        d) One child, Noah, has begun to experience recurrent stomach aches on transition days (days when custody transfers between the parties), a somatic manifestation consistent with stress associated with the current custodial transitions and parental conflict.
        e) Defendant's unilateral scheduling of activities on Plaintiff's custodial time, together with verbal disparagement and the resulting emotional distress in the children, has materially impaired the stability of the children's home environment and undermined the parental cooperation and co-parenting that the Court's order intended to preserve.
   4.3. These changes are material because they affect the children's physical and emotional well-being and the practical ability of Plaintiff to parent during her custodial time, and because they indicate a pattern of conduct by Defendant that is contrary to the prior order's directive to support the children's relationship with both parents and not to disparage the other parent in their presence.

5. Legal Standard
   5.1. Plaintiff brings this complaint pursuant to the Court's authority to modify custody orders upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child. See M.G.L. c. 208; M.G.L. c. 209C; and applicable Massachusetts caselaw establishing the standard for modification based on material change and best interests of the child.
   5.2. Plaintiff relies on the principle that a change in custody requires both a showing of a material change in circumstances and that the requested modification would be in the children's best interests. The factors the Court considers include the children's adjustment to their home, school and community; the fitness of the parents; the continuity and stability of care; and any conduct by a parent that impairs the child's physical or emotional well-being.

6. Relief Requested — Modification Sought
   6.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the existing custody order in the following respects:
        a) Award primary physical custody of Emma Thompson and Noah Thompson to Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, subject to reasonable parenting time for Defendant according to a schedule to be determined by the Court (for example, reasonable alternate weekends and agreed-upon weekday or summer parenting time), or in the alternative such other schedule as the Court deems in the best interests of the children.
        b) Clarify and formalize decision-making authority regarding children's extracurricular activities and scheduling, by ordering that scheduling of new recurring extracurricular commitments shall require the mutual, good-faith consent of both parents if such commitments occur during the other parent's scheduled custodial time, and create a process for resolving scheduling disputes (for example, mandatory notice at least 30 days prior to enrollment, mediation for disputes, and temporary postponement of activities that conflict with a parent's scheduled custodial time until agreement is reached).
        c) Reinstate and reinforce an express no-disparagement provision: both parents shall refrain from making derogatory statements about the other parent in the presence of the children or to third parties in a manner intended to reach the children, and both parents shall take affirmative steps to support the children's relationship with the other parent.
        d) Order make-up parenting time or makeup opportunities for Defendant when a parent unilaterally schedules activities that materially interfere with the other parent's custodial time, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.
        e) Order such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the health, welfare, and best interests of Emma and Noah.
   6.2. Plaintiff further requests that the Court order evaluation or counseling for the children as the Court deems appropriate (including child therapy or a parenting coordinator) to address the children's transition-related distress, and/or order parental education or co-parenting counseling for the parties if the Court finds it would assist in implementing and maintaining a cooperative parenting arrangement.

7. Basis for Relief and Authorities (Representative)
   7.1. Statutory authority and legal principles supporting this application include the statutes and precedents governing modification of custody orders and the best interests standard. Representative authorities include:
        - M.G.L. c. 208 (statutory provisions applicable to custody and modification after divorce)
        - M.G.L. c. 209C (statutory provisions applicable to parentage and custody)
        - M.G.L. c. 119 (child welfare provisions; Court's authority to act in the best interests of children)
        - Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights and deference to fit parents)
        - Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979) (parental rights and children's welfare)
        - Adoption of a Child, 418 Mass. 189 (1994) (discussing best interests principles)*
        - [Massachusetts case law holding that a modification of custody requires a material change in circumstances and that courts evaluate the best interests of the child, including stability and parental conduct that affects the child]**
        - [Massachusetts appellate decisions recognizing that parental disparagement and undermining of co-parenting can support modification]**
        - [Massachusetts authority permitting the Court to impose detailed parental communication, scheduling and no-disparagement provisions as part of custody orders]**
        - [Massachusetts decisions recognizing somatic symptoms in children (e.g., stomach aches) can be evidence of emotional distress relevant to custody determinations]**
   7.2. Plaintiff intends to rely on the foregoing statutes, controlling Massachusetts caselaw, and additional relevant decisions and statutory provisions as may be cited in briefs, affidavits, and at hearing. Plaintiff will submit evidence, including testimony from the children (through appropriate procedure), testimony from Plaintiff, and any other witnesses or records (e.g., communications, school or medical records documenting the children's symptoms), to establish the material change in circumstances and that the requested modification is in the children's best interests.

   Note: Plaintiff expressly relies on Massachusetts statutory and case law principles providing that a material change in circumstances and the best interests of the children are the controlling legal standards for modification of custody, and that the Court has broad authority to structure custody, parenting time, and parental responsibilities in a manner that promotes the children's welfare and stability.

8. Prayer for Relief
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   a) Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2022 custody order;
   b) Modify the existing custody order to award primary physical custody of Emma and Noah to Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and enter an appropriate parenting time schedule for Defendant, Kyle Miller;
   c) Order clear, enforceable rules governing the scheduling of extracurricular activities and other time-sensitive commitments, including required notice and mutual consent requirements for activities that conflict with the other parent's scheduled custodial time, and a mechanism to resolve scheduling disputes;
   d) Order both parents to refrain from disparaging or denigrating the other parent in the presence of the children and to take affirmative steps to support the children's relationship with the other parent;
   e) Order make-up parenting time or compensation when one parent unilaterally interferes with the other parent's custodial time by scheduling activities during that time without agreement;
   f) Order counseling, evaluation, or services for the children and/or parties as the Court deems appropriate (including child therapy or a parenting coordinator);
   g) Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of Emma and Noah; and
   h) Award costs and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

9. Verification
