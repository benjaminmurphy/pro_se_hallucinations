COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

1. Parties and Jurisdiction

1.1 Petitioner. Jessica Miller (“Mother” or “Petitioner”), residing at an address on file with the Court, telephone (617) 555-0123, email psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Respondent. Kevin Miller (“Father” or “Respondent”), address and contact information on file with the Court.

1.3 Child. This Complaint concerns the custody and parenting time of the parties’ minor child, Emily Miller, born 2015 (age 10).

1.4 Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes governing child custody and under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B. The prior custody order was entered in this Court on May 15, 2018 (the “2018 Order”), and the parties and child have continuing contacts with Massachusetts such that this Court maintains jurisdiction to modify custody.

2. Relief Sought

2.1 Petitioner seeks a modification of the 2018 Order to reflect a material change in circumstances since the entry of that order and to allocate increased physical parenting time to Petitioner, including additional overnights and an adjustment of the weekly schedule to permit Emily substantially increased time with her mother. Petitioner requests pendente lite relief to expand parenting time while the modification is pending, a full hearing on modification, and such other relief as is in the child’s best interests.

3. Relevant Prior Order

3.1 The 2018 Order (entered May 15, 2018) provided that the child’s primary residence would be with Father, with Mother to have limited weekend visits and one weeknight dinner visit per week. The 2018 Order was entered after consideration of the parties’ circumstances at that time, including Petitioner’s enrollment in graduate school, her residence in a studio apartment, and limited flexibility in schedule.

4. Material Change in Circumstances

4.1 Since the 2018 Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child that warrants modification of physical parenting time and custody.

4.2 Change in Petitioner’s circumstances:
- Petitioner has completed graduate school (graduation completed after entry of the 2018 Order).
- Petitioner is now employed in a stable full-time position with regular daytime hours and stable income sufficient to provide for the child.
- Petitioner resides in a two‑bedroom apartment where Emily has her own bedroom and appropriate living space and stability.

4.3 Child’s emotional and therapeutic needs:
- Emily has developed a close and age-appropriate bond with Petitioner. Emily’s therapist has reported that Emily experiences significant guilt and distress at having to end visits that are presently short and that Emily has expressed a clear preference for increased time and overnights with Petitioner. The therapist’s observations and letter are being filed as an exhibit. Emily has also written a letter addressed to the Court expressing her wish for more overnight time with her mother; that letter is attached as an exhibit to this Complaint.

4.4 Parental cooperation:
- Father refuses to discuss reasonable modifications of the parenting schedule and becomes angry when Emily or Petitioner raise the issue of increased time with Petitioner. Father’s refusal to cooperate and the child’s distress about raising the subject with Father adversely affect Emily’s emotional welfare.

4.5 These developments were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the 2018 Order and together constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification under Massachusetts law.

5. Legal Standard

5.1 Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification of custody must demonstrate a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare since entry of the prior order and that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interest. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (governing custody determinations after divorce and related proceedings) and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B. Courts evaluate the best interests of the child considering multiple factors, including the child’s needs, the child’s relationship with each parent, the stability of each home, the child’s preference when appropriate, and the mental and physical health of all individuals involved.

5.2 Petitioner alleges facts establishing a material change in circumstances and that the requested modification (increased overnights and a revised parenting schedule) is in Emily’s best interests for the reasons set forth above.

5.3 Authority. Petitioner relies on Massachusetts statutory and case law principles governing modification, including but not limited to: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA); the best-interest-of-the-child standard as articulated by the Massachusetts courts; and decisions holding that changed parental capacity, improved housing and stability, the child’s preference (when appropriate), therapeutic recommendations, and parental inability/refusal to cooperate may constitute material changes warranting modification. See, e.g., authorities and illustrative authorities discussed below.

6. Facts Supporting Modification

6.1 Petitioner’s Education and Employment. At the time of the 2018 Order Petitioner was a graduate student living in a studio and had limited time and financial resources to care for Emily for extended periods. Petitioner has completed her graduate program and is presently employed full-time at a stable job with regular daytime hours and reliable income. Petitioner’s employment affords predictable scheduling and capability to provide day-to-day care.

6.2 Housing. Petitioner now lives in a two‑bedroom apartment with sufficient space for Emily to have her own bedroom and appropriate accommodations for overnight stays, homework, and extracurricular storage. This housing was not available to Petitioner at the time of the 2018 Order.

6.3 Child’s Preferences and Therapeutic Input. Emily, age ten, has expressed to her mother and therapist a clear preference for more contact with Petitioner, including increased overnight stays. Emily’s therapist has documented Emily’s feelings of guilt and distress after visits with Petitioner that end early under the current schedule. The therapist has written recommending increased time with Petitioner be considered in Emily’s best interest. The child’s own letter to the Court supports the modification request.

6.4 Parental Cooperation and Conflict. Father has refused to negotiate or discuss parenting-time modifications and reacts angrily when Emily brings up the subject, creating family stress that affects Emily’s emotional health. Father’s position has prevented any informal resolution and necessitates court intervention.

7. Requested Modification, Interim Relief, and Proposed Parenting Plan

7.1 Requested Relief. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:

a) Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Order that justifies modification of the physical parenting schedule and custody;

b) Modify the 2018 Order to provide increased parenting time to Petitioner, including additional overnights appropriate for a child of Emily’s age (for example, alternating weekends with overnights and expansion of weekday time as the Court deems appropriate), and otherwise restructure the weekly schedule to reflect shared parenting and the child’s best interests;

c) Consider and implement Emily’s expressed wishes to the extent consistent with her best interests and developmental needs;

d) Order pendente lite relief granting expanded parenting time to Petitioner while this matter is pending if the Court concludes such interim relief is in Emily’s best interest and will not be harmful to Emily;

e) Order an appropriate custody evaluation, psychological evaluation, or mediation as the Court deems necessary to address the child’s best interests;

f) Award such other and further relief as the Court deems appropriate, including costs and fees if the Court finds them appropriate upon motion;

g) Set this matter for an expedited hearing in light of the child’s emotional needs and best interest.

7.2 Proposed Parenting Schedule. The Petitioner proposes the Court consider a parenting schedule that increases Petitioner’s overnights consistent with Emily’s age and needs such as alternating weekends with overnight stays, one or more weeknight overnights as consistent with school and activities, and expanded summer and holiday time to allow meaningful relationship development, subject to the Court’s assessment and any recommendations from evaluators.

8. Exhibits

8.1 Petitioner will file the following exhibits with this Complaint (or present them to the Court at the earliest opportunity):

- Exhibit A: Copy of the 2018 custody order (May 15, 2018).
- Exhibit B: Letter from Emily to the Court expressing her preference.
- Exhibit C: Letter or report from Emily’s therapist summarizing therapeutic observations and recommendations.
- Exhibit D: Petitioner’s declaration describing education, employment, residence, and proposed schedule.
- Exhibit E: Any other relevant documentation (employment verification, lease for two‑bedroom apartment, etc.).

9. Legal Authorities (Representative)

Petitioner respectfully directs the Court to the applicable Massachusetts statutes and case law principles that govern custody modification and the best interest determination, including but not limited to the following authorities and principles:

Statutes:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — jurisdiction and continuing jurisdiction rules).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions relating to custody and the Probate and Family Court’s authority concerning children ordered incident to divorce or other proceedings).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §39F (statutory provisions concerning children’s welfare where applicable).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 (jurisdictional provisions for the Probate and Family Court).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, §3 (writs and remedies in equity where appropriate for relief).

Selected Massachusetts Caselaw and Principles (illustrative; Petitioner will rely on the Court’s formulation of controlling precedent):
- Courts require a showing of a material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order sufficient to justify modification.
- The child’s best interests are paramount; courts consider child’s needs, relationships with parents, home stability, school and community, child’s reasonable preferences (depending on age/maturity), and the parents’ ability to cooperate.
- Therapeutic recommendations, a child’s expressed preference (when mature enough), improved parental housing and employment stability, and parental inability/refusal to cooperate have been recognized as factors supporting modification where the evidence supports best-interest findings.

(For the Court’s convenience Petitioner’s counsel (or Petitioner pro se) will cite specific controlling Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions at or before hearing consistent with the Court’s citation practices. Representative authorities include controlling SJC and Appeals Court decisions addressing material change and best-interest standards and authorities interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 208 and 209B.)

10. Certification and Prayer for Relief

10.1 Petitioner certifies that the statements in this Complaint are true to the best of Petitioner’s knowledge, information, and belief, and that Petitioner will produce evidence at hearing to support the factual allegations and requested relief.

10.2 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:

a) Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since May 15, 2018 which justifies modification of the custody/parenting-time provisions of the 2018 Order;

b) Modify the existing custody and parenting-time arrangement to grant Petitioner increased physical parenting time and overnights as are in the child’s best interests;

c) Enter such temporary pendente lite orders expanding Petitioner’s parenting time pending final resolution if the Court finds such interim relief appropriate;

d) Order any custody evaluations, psychological evaluations, mediation, or other inquiries the Court deems necessary;

e) Award such further relief as the Court deems just and proper; and

f) Grant costs and fees as the Court may deem appropriate.
