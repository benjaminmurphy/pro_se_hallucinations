  "elements": {
    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant owned/operated/controlled the restaurant and that Plaintiff was an invited customer (paras. 2, 4) and expressly alleges Defendant owed invitees a duty to maintain premises and warn of hazards (para. 13). These facts adequately plead duty."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific acts/omissions: server dropped glasses and left water/ice on the tile, staff did not place warnings or promptly clean, and Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to follow its procedures and exercise reasonable care (paras. 5\u20137, 14). These facts adequately plead a breach."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads a direct sequence of events: spilled water/ice remained on the floor, Plaintiff walked through the hallway and slipped on that wet area, resulting in injury (paras. 5\u20138). These allegations sufficiently plead that the injury would not have occurred but for the hazardous condition left by Defendant/staff."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Allegations show the harm (slip and knee injury) was a foreseeable result of leaving a wet, unmarked floor in a pedestrian hallway; staff statements that they had been \"dodging that puddle\" bolster foreseeability and proximate causation (paras. 6, 8, 16)."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads concrete damages: medical treatment (approx. $2,200), lost wages (approx. $1,500), ongoing pain, disability, and other compensable harms (paras. 9\u201310, 17). These allegations adequately plead actual damages."
