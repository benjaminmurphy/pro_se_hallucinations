In that broad, background sense\u2014as a general authority relevant to custody/child\u2011safety disputes\u2014it is an appropriate citation, though it does not address Massachusetts statutes or standards specifically.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. \u2026 Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.\u201d"

Santosky is a leading U.S. Supreme Court case on due process protections and the required standard of proof in proceedings to terminate parental rights, emphasizing the fundamental liberty interest in the parent-child relationship. It is therefore appropriately cited as a general authority on constitutional protections in serious child protection and custody\u2010related proceedings, including in Massachusetts practice.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. \u2026 When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures. \u2026 [B]efore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\u201d"
