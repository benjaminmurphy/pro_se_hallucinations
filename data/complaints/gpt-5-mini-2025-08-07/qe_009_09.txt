JESSICA COLLINS,
     Plaintiff

v.

MARK THOMPSON,
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Collins ("Plaintiff" or "Ms. Collins") is an individual and a residential tenant who currently resides at 125 Maple Street, Apartment [insert apt. # if known], Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01103. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant" or "Landlord") is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103 and is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. Plaintiff entered a residential tenancy with Defendant for the premises located at 125 Maple Street beginning January 15, 2022. The rent is $1,200 per month.

4. This action arises under the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment and related Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and regulations. The Housing Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes and related claims and has personal jurisdiction over the parties. Venue is proper in the Housing Court of Springfield because the leased premises are located in Hampden County. See M.G.L. c. 239; M.G.L. c. 186.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff lived in the two-bedroom apartment at 125 Maple Street and paid monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant.

6. Beginning approximately on or about October 20, 2025, Plaintiff began experiencing an electrical outage limited to one of the two bedrooms (the "Affected Room"). The outage has persisted for approximately six (6) weeks as of the filing date (December 1, 2025).

7. The Affected Room has no working overhead light and none of the electrical outlets in that room function. The rest of the apartment—including the living room, kitchen, and the other bedroom—has electricity and functions normally.

8. Plaintiff used the Affected Room primarily as a home office. As a direct result of the electrical outage, the Affected Room is unusable for its intended purpose and Plaintiff has been deprived of the use of that room.

9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical problem. In response, Defendant arranged for an electrician to inspect the Affected Room. The electrician informed Defendant that a more extensive repair would be required to correct the wiring problem and that the repair was "complicated" due to older wiring in the building.

10. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that he is "getting quotes" and that the repair is proceeding slowly because of the condition of the building’s wiring. Defendant has not completed or substantially commenced the requisite repair to restore electricity to the Affected Room and has not provided a reasonable timetable for completion.

11. Because the Affected Room cannot be used, Plaintiff was forced to cease working from home in the apartment. Plaintiff has been compelled to work from coffee shops, incurring approximately $15 per day in coffee and food expenses in order to have a place to sit and work during the outage. Plaintiff has also been paying for a coworking space membership at a cost of $150 per month in order to continue her employment. Plaintiff’s office equipment and work materials are cramped into the living room, causing significant interference with daily living and making the apartment feel unlivable for its intended residential uses.

12. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the electrical wiring in the Affected Room has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her leased premises and has deprived Plaintiff of the benefit and use of a portion of the apartment.

13. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, including out-of-pocket expenses for daily coffee/food ($15/day), coworking space membership ($150/month), inconvenience, diminution of rental value, and other consequential harms. Plaintiff estimates total damages in the amount of approximately $900 based on the period of deprivation and her documented expenditures and other losses.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law, Massachusetts)

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by which the landlord warrants that the tenant's possession will not be substantially interfered with by the landlord’s conduct or omissions or by an inability to use a significant portion of the premises. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 12.1 et seq.; see also authorities cited below.

16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from substantial and unreasonable interference with their use and enjoyment of the leased premises, including situations in which the landlord’s failure to make necessary repairs deprives the tenant of the beneficial use of a portion of the premises. Prior Massachusetts decisions and established authority recognize that serious failures to maintain essential services (including electrical service to habitability-related areas) and other substantial interferences with the tenant’s use of the leased premises breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See authorities cited below.

17. Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to effect timely, reasonable repairs to restore electricity to the Affected Room, thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. Defendant had notice of the problem, had the ability to cause repairs to be performed, and unreasonably delayed completion of the necessary repair, all of which directly caused Plaintiff’s damages.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered economic and non-economic damages, including but not limited to costs for coffee and food while working remotely ($15/day), coworking membership fees ($150/month), loss of use of the Affected Room, inconvenience, impairment of the quiet enjoyment and habitability of the apartment, and other consequential damages in an amount to be proven at trial. Plaintiff estimates said damages at approximately $900 to date and reserves the right to amend this amount upon further proof.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to: (i) economic damages for out-of-pocket expenses (coffee/food while working, coworking membership fees), (ii) diminution in rental value for loss of use of the Affected Room, and (iii) other consequential damages related to the breach, with a current estimated total of approximately $900, and with leave to amend or increase this amount as proved at trial;

B. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award costs, filing fees, and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by statute or contract (Plaintiff requests costs and any allowable fees);

D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
