COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson brings this action against her landlord, Mark Henderson, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to a tenant under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of her rental premises, economic losses caused by sleeplessness and medication, and injunctive relief ordering Defendant to abate the continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson is a natural person and tenant residing at 45 Willow Street, Apartment (second floor), Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. Defendant Mark Henderson is the landlord of the property located at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, MA, and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Plaintiff has been a tenant of the premises since January 1, 2022 pursuant to a residential lease. Plaintiff pays rent in the amount of $1,200.00 per month to Defendant.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in the Somerville District Court because the rental unit is located in Somerville, the damages sought (exclusive of statutory interest and costs) are within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court, and this Court is the appropriate forum for landlord-tenant disputes arising in Somerville.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. The dwelling unit at 45 Willow Street is a second-floor apartment in a triple-decker building. Plaintiff and the other tenants in the building share a common landlord, Defendant Henderson.

8. Beginning in approximately June 2025 (roughly six months prior to the filing of this Complaint), new tenants moved into the third-floor unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment.

9. Since their move-in, the occupants of the unit above Plaintiff have created excessive and unreasonable noise, including repeated stomping, loud music late at night, and noises consistent with furniture being dragged or moved at midnight and other late hours.

10. The noise constitutes a substantial and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her leased premises for residential purposes.

11. Plaintiff has made repeated, good-faith efforts to resolve the problem informally: she spoke directly to the upstairs occupants and requested that they reduce their noise; they complied briefly for about one week but then resumed the excessive noise.

12. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant on approximately five or six separate occasions, notifying Defendant of the continuing, severe noise disturbance and requesting intervention.

13. Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants one time but has failed to take any effective remedial action. Defendant has explicitly told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”

14. Defendant’s refusal or failure to take reasonable steps to abate the noise has allowed the continuing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her apartment.

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has experienced severe sleep deprivation, averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night, for which she has suffered consequential adverse effects.

16. Plaintiff was issued a written warning at work for falling asleep at the workplace as a direct consequence of chronic sleep deprivation caused by the noise disturbances.

17. Plaintiff sought medical treatment for sleep problems caused by the persistent noise. Her treating physician prescribed sleep medication to help her sleep. Plaintiff pays approximately $40.00 per month for the medication.

18. Plaintiff has expended other out-of-pocket sums attempting to mitigate the effects of the noise, including the purchase of earplugs and a white-noise machine, and she has reconfigured her bedroom in an effort to reduce the noise impact. These measures did not eliminate the disturbance.

19. Plaintiff estimates her total non-rent economic losses and general damages attributable to Defendant’s breach to be $2,400.00 (which accounts conservatively for lost sleep, reduced enjoyment, medical expenses, and other out-of-pocket costs to date). Plaintiff reserves the right to amend and supplement the amount of damages as discovery progresses.

20. Plaintiff’s lease contains an express covenant that she is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the premises. In any event, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment runs with every lease under Massachusetts law and obligates the landlord to ensure that a tenant may peaceably possess and enjoy the premises without substantial interference.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

21. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

22. The lease between Plaintiff and Defendant includes an express covenant to provide quiet enjoyment of the premises; alternatively, Massachusetts law implies a covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential tenancies.

23. The covenant of quiet enjoyment requires that the tenant be allowed to inhabit and use the premises in peace, free from substantial, unreasonable, and continuing interference caused by the landlord or persons over whom the landlord has control or responsibility.

24. Defendant, as landlord of the premises, had a duty to take reasonable steps to abate substantial and continuing disturbances emanating from other tenants when notified of such disturbances and when such disturbances interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

25. Defendant was on actual notice of the upstairs tenants’ excessive and continuing noise and has refused or failed to take reasonable steps to abate the disturbance. Defendant stated that he “can’t control how people live,” indicating a deliberate decision not to intervene effectively.

26. Defendant’s failure to act after repeated complaints constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment because it allowed the continuation of a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment.

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including, but not limited to, medical expenses (sleep medication), lost sleep and associated impairment, workplace discipline (written warning), purchase of mitigation devices (earplugs, white-noise machine), reduced enjoyment of her home, and other consequential damages. Plaintiff estimates current damages at $2,400.00 and seeks recovery for all damages proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. A declaratory judgment that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under the lease and Massachusetts law;

B. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but currently estimated at no less than $2,400.00, together with interest, costs, and expenses;

C. An order of injunctive relief requiring Defendant to take reasonable steps to abate the noise disturbance and to enforce the terms of the lease against tenants who create substantial and unreasonable disturbances so as to restore Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises — including, if necessary, ordering Defendant to take specific remedial actions such as mediation between tenants, issuance of warnings, adherence to building rules regarding noise, or eviction of problem tenants if such measures are lawful and necessary;

D. Alternatively or additionally, such other equitable relief as the Court deems necessary to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the premises;

E. Costs of suit and such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
