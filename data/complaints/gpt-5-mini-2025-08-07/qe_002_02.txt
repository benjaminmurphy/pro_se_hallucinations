COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Count I — Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment Under Massachusetts Law)

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Lee ("Plaintiff" or “Tenant”) is a resident of Roxbury, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 or psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Martha Johnson ("Defendant" or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 345 Walnut St, Basement Unit, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the "Premises"). To the extent required, Defendant may be served at the Premises.

3. This action arises under the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment and related Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and supporting statutory and regulatory authority. The amount in controversy for the relief sought (actual damages) is within the monetary limits of the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, and venue and jurisdiction are proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Roxbury, Suffolk County (see, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; ch. 239).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into possession of the basement unit at 345 Walnut St, Roxbury, MA 02119. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent to Defendant.

5. In October 2025 Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on that month’s rent payment due to unexpected medical bills. Plaintiff paid the outstanding rent and the landlord's demanded late fee in full shortly thereafter.

6. In November 2025, after heavy rain, Plaintiff discovered water seeping through the basement wall of the Premises. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant by text message. Defendant responded that she would "look into it."

7. Several weeks passed and Defendant took no meaningful remedial action to stop or abate the water intrusion. The leakage continued with subsequent rains.

8. Concerned for health and safety and because the problem persisted, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston, which inspected the Premises. The city inspector identified the water intrusion and additional code-related conditions related to the basement unit (inspection report on file with the City of Boston).

9. The water intrusion damaged Plaintiff's personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf kept against the affected wall. Plaintiff estimates the property damage at approximately $400.

10. Because of persistent dampness and mold risk, Plaintiff has run a dehumidifier continuously to maintain livable conditions. This has increased Plaintiff’s electric utility usage and expense.

11. In late November 2025 and December 2025, Defendant has labeled Plaintiff a "problem tenant" and told Plaintiff she will not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026. Defendant states the nonrenewal is motivated by Plaintiff’s late October rent payment. The timing of Defendant's refusal to renew, coming after the City inspection and Defendant’s knowledge of the water intrusion, is suspicious and tends to show that Defendant is attempting to remove Plaintiff in retaliation for reporting the habitability problem to authorities and for asserting rights related to the Premises.

12. Despite Plaintiff’s reports and the City’s inspection, Defendant has not repaired the water intrusion or otherwise remedied the conditions that interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

13. Defendant’s conduct — failure to repair a material defect that allows water intrusion; permitting ongoing damp and potentially hazardous conditions; damaging Plaintiff’s personal property by the intrusion; and threatening not to renew Plaintiff’s lease immediately after the inspection and Plaintiff’s complaints — has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s possession and use of the Premises. Plaintiff has therefore suffered actual damages, inconvenience, emotional distress, and increased utility expenses.

LEGAL BACKGROUND

14. Under Massachusetts common law, every landlord’s lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under which the tenant is entitled to the use and enjoyment of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord. See generally Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing judicially implied warranty of habitability and related protections for tenants); see also cases and authorities recognizing that materially defective conditions that substantially interfere with tenancy can constitute breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment and give rise to damages and other remedies. See also state and local habitability standards such as the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.) and public-health statutes empowering local boards of health to inspect and order repairs (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 §127).

15. Massachusetts law and the State Sanitary Code set minimum standards of fitness for human habitation; a landlord's knowing failure to remedy hazardous or habitability conditions, or permitting conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, may constitute breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may support an award of damages. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant law generally); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 §127 (health inspections and enforcement); 105 CMR 410.000 (State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

16. Massachusetts courts and courts in other jurisdictions have repeatedly recognized that landlord failure to repair significant defects, or conduct interfering with the tenant's peaceful possession, may constitute breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or the implied warranty of habitability and that tenants may recover actual damages. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); Sommer v. Kridel, 74 N.J. 446, 378 A.2d 1215 (1977). Massachusetts courts have applied similar principles in the landlord-tenant context. See generally Mass. caselaw interpreting landlord duties and tenants’ remedies (see, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; ch. 239; State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000).

(Authoritative examples and related authority: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and related landlord-tenant provisions); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 §127; 105 CMR 410.000; Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); Sommer v. Kridel, 378 A.2d 1215 (N.J. 1977); and other authorities recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord repair obligations.)

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 16 above.

18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law into every residential lease in Massachusetts and requires the landlord to refrain from conduct that renders the tenant's occupancy substantially untenable or interferes with the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises.

19. Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by permitting ongoing water intrusion into the Premises, failing to timely and reasonably repair or abate the problem after being notified, allowing conditions that damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, and by taking other actions and making threats that have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including, but not limited to:
    a. Damage to personal property (approximately $400);
    b. Increased electric utility costs caused by continuous dehumidifier use (to be proven at trial);
    c. Out-of-pocket expenses and inconvenience, emotional distress, and other consequential damages in an amount to be proved at trial.

21. Plaintiff seeks recovery for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including actual damages, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate under the circumstances and law.

Gen. Laws ch. 186; ch. 111; 105 CMR 410.000.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant as follows:

Notes and guidance (informational, not part of the complaint):
- Plaintiff should attach or be prepared to submit copies of relevant documents (texts to landlord, rent receipts showing late payment and late fee, photos of water intrusion and damaged property, appliance receipts, the City of Boston inspection report, and any communications from Defendant concerning lease nonrenewal).
- The Court may require proof of damages and proof of the City’s inspection findings; Plaintiff should preserve and produce documents and photographs.
- If Plaintiff intends to assert a claim of retaliatory eviction or seek statutory protections based on a housing inspection, Plaintiff may consider additional statutory claims; at present this complaint pleads only a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as requested.
