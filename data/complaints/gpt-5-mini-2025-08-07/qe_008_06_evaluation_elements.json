    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff is a tenant residing at 45 Washington Ave, Defendant is the owner/landlord, and Plaintiff has rented the apartment since January 15, 2022 on a month-to-month basis for $1,450/month (\u00b6\u00b61\u20134), which sufficiently pleads a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges multiple notices to Defendant about a broken main entry lock (\u00b67, \u00b68), Defendant acknowledged the problem and failed to make meaningful repairs or adequately secure the entry (\u00b67\u20138, \u00b614), which adequately pleads an omission by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the unsecured entry allowed an unknown person to enter common areas and steal tenants\u2019 packages (\u00b69\u201310), evidence of someone sleeping in the basement creating ongoing safety risk (\u00b611), and resulting fear, diminished use, and expenditures to secure the apartment (\u00b612\u201313, \u00b621), facts which, if proved, amount to a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a temporal and causal chain: Defendant failed to repair the defective main entry lock after notice (\u00b67\u20138), the entry remained unsecured, unauthorized entry and theft occurred (\u00b69\u201310), and Plaintiff\u2019s losses and fear flowed from that failure (\u00b610\u201313, \u00b620), which sufficiently pleads causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific monetary damages ($120 for the stolen package and $200 for security-related expenditures, totaling $320) and non\u2011monetary harms (fear, diminished use, emotional distress) (\u00b610, \u00b613, \u00b616, \u00b621), which adequately pleads damages."
