Although the court mentions rodents hypothetically when describing the types of injuries habitability breaches can cause, this is dicta and not tied to the actual facts or holding. Thus, the case supports the broader idea that serious habitability defects can warrant damages, but not specifically that persistent vermin or rodent infestations constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment or habitability under Massachusetts or other authority.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cDamages for annoyance and discomfort are reasonable in light of the fact that\n\n  the residential tenant who has suffered a breach of the warranty . . . cannot bathe as frequently as he would like or at all if there is inadequate hot water; he must worry about rodents harassing his children or spreading disease if the premises are infested; or he must avoid certain rooms or worry about catching a cold if there is inadequate weather protection or heat. Thus, discomfort and annoyance are the common injuries caused by each breach \u2026\u201d"

Hemingway and similar authorities in articulating the modern implied warranty of habitability. The New York Court of Appeals squarely states that insect or rodent infestation are conditions that materially affect health and safety and thus fall within a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, entitling tenants to rent abatement. That directly supports the proposition that persistent vermin/rodent infestations substantially interfering with reasonable use can constitute such a breach and warrant damages or equitable relief.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"A residential lease is essentially a sale of shelter and necessarily encompasses those services which render the premises suitable for the purpose for which they are leased. ... he does warrant, however, that there are no conditions that materially affect the health and safety of tenants. For example, no one will dispute that health and safety are adversely affected by insect or rodent infestation, insufficient heat and plumbing facilities, significantly dangerous electrical outlets or wiring, inadequate sanitation facilities or similar services which constitute the essence of the modern dwelling unit.\""
