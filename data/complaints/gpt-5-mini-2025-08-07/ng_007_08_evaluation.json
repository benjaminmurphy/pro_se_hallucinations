Cardozo explicitly grounds duty in the range of reasonably perceivable risk and repeatedly ties negligence and duty together as relational concepts, which is the same foreseeability-based framework reflected in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 291\u2013300. The case does not address \u00a7 324A\u2019s specific undertaking doctrine, but it directly supports using Palsgraf as authority for the foreseeability concept and its role in defining duty.",
