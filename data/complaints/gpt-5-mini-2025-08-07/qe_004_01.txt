COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Maria Thompson ("Plaintiff"), and for her Complaint against Defendant John Carter ("Defendant" or "Landlord") alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maria Thompson is an individual and resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603; telephone (617) 555-0123; email psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant John Carter is the owner and landlord of the residential rental premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603 (the "Premises"). Defendant may be served at the Premises or at any other known address.

3. Plaintiff rented the Premises from Defendant pursuant to a residential tenancy that began on June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent.

4. The Worcester District Court has jurisdiction over this matter and venue is proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Worcester and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Worcester.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein.

6. Beginning in approximately September 2025 (about three months before the date of this Complaint), Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in the kitchen of the Premises.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent problem and requested effective remediation.

8. In response, Defendant placed a small number of snap traps in the kitchen. Over the next several weeks Plaintiff and/or Defendant caught approximately two mice, but the rodent evidence (droppings) continued to appear on a recurring weekly basis.

9. Defendant advised Plaintiff that rodent activity is "normal for older buildings" and repeatedly told Plaintiff to clean the kitchen more thoroughly. Plaintiff maintains and has maintained a high level of cleanliness in her kitchen; she does not store food improperly and takes reasonable care to keep the unit clean.

10. Defendant did hire an exterminator for a single visit. The exterminator indicated to Plaintiff that the building required more comprehensive and ongoing treatment to address an existing infestation and to prevent re-infestation. Defendant declined to authorize repeated or comprehensive treatments, referring to them as "overkill" and asserting they were too expensive.

11. As a result of the continuing rodent problem and Defendant’s failure to conduct adequate and ongoing extermination, Plaintiff has been forced to discard food in open boxes or bags that became contaminated by pest evidence. Plaintiff estimates the cost of food discarded to be approximately $200.

12. Plaintiff also purchased plastic food-storage containers and related supplies to prevent future contamination; those items cost approximately $80.

13. Plaintiff has experienced ongoing anxiety, fear, and diminished use and enjoyment of the kitchen and the Premises. She has been reluctant to cook or eat in her apartment given the persistent rodent droppings.

14. Plaintiff has repeatedly complained and requested further remedial measures, but Defendant has refused to undertake the comprehensive extermination and preventive measures recommended by the exterminator and otherwise necessary to abate the infestation.

15. The ongoing rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to take reasonable remedial measures constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise that the tenant shall peaceably and quietly have and enjoy the leased premises, free from substantial interference by the landlord (or by conditions that the landlord is obligated to remedy). See Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the relationship between the warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (warranty of habitability and related remedies); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (R.I. 1984) (same).

18. Massachusetts courts and authorities have recognized that landlords must maintain rental premises in a condition that does not substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises; persistent infestations of rodents and pests can constitute such a substantial interference and give rise to liability for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Javins, supra; Hilder, supra; Green, supra; see also Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 5.1; § 7.4 (illustrating the recognized landlord obligations with respect to habitability and quiet enjoyment).

19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to take reasonable and effective measures to abate and prevent a rodent infestation at the Premises once Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the condition.

20. Defendant breached that duty by failing to implement comprehensive, ongoing extermination and prevention measures after being notified of the persistent rodent activity, by declining to follow the exterminator’s recommendation for more comprehensive treatment, and by dismissing Plaintiff’s complaints as attributable to ordinary dirtiness rather than addressing the infestation.

21. Defendant’s conduct significantly and adversely affected Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, depriving Plaintiff of the full benefit of her tenancy: Plaintiff has been forced to discard food, incur out-of-pocket expense for storage containers, suffer ongoing anxiety about cooking and eating in her home, and otherwise endure repeated and continuing intrusions into her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has sustained actual damages in the amount of at least $280 (including approximately $200 for discarded food and approximately $80 for storage containers). Plaintiff also has suffered non-economic damages in the form of emotional distress, loss of quiet enjoyment, and inconvenience.

23. Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to the bringing of this action, including providing Defendant notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the condition prior to filing suit.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding damages to Plaintiff for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in the amount of $280 (or such other amount as the Court finds proven at trial) for actual out-of-pocket losses;

B. Awarding additional compensatory damages for loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and inconvenience in an amount to be determined at trial;

C. Awarding interest, costs, and disbursements as allowed by law;

D. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITIES (Representative)

Plaintiff relies upon and cites the following authorities in support of the legal theory advanced in this Complaint (this list is representative and not exhaustive):

Statutes:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant; relevant provisions governing landlord obligations and tenant remedies);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process; jurisdictional provisions);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection — general statutory background on unfair or deceptive acts; cited for general context though not pled as a separate claim here).

Leading cases and authorities recognizing landlord duties and the covenant of quiet enjoyment, habitability, and remedies for interference:
- Javins v. First Nat. Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970);
- Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974);
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (R.I. 1984);
- Kendall v. Ernest? (see Restatement and treatises on landlord obligations);
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 5.1; § 7.4;
- Additional persuasive authority recognizing that persistent infestations are substantial interferences with habitability and quiet enjoyment: see e.g., Park West Management Corp. decisions; applicable appellate decisions discussing habitability and quiet enjoyment (see Javins, Hilder, Green, and their progeny).

Note: Plaintiff’s claim is grounded in Massachusetts common law principles of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s duty to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with tenancy. The authorities listed above are representative of the body of law recognizing the landlord’s obligations; Plaintiff reserves the right to rely on other Massachusetts statutory and case authorities as appropriate.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for the relief requested above.

Respectfully submitted,
