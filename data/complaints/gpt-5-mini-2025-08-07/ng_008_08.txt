COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Michael Johnson, by way of Complaint against the Defendant Quincy Bistro, and for his cause of action alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Michael Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Quincy Bistro (“Defendant”) is a restaurant doing business at 123 Main St., Quincy, Massachusetts 02169. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, occupied, managed, maintained and/or controlled the premises located at 123 Main St., Quincy, MA 02169 (the “Premises”).

3. The events giving rise to this action occurred on September 15, 2023, at the Premises located at 123 Main St., Quincy, MA 02169, which is in Norfolk County, and venue is therefore proper in this Court.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold of the Norfolk County Superior Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful invitee at the Defendant’s restaurant, seated in the dining room for the purpose of patronizing the business.

6. A narrow hallway connected the dining room and the kitchen. The hallway was tiled.

7. At or about 8:00 p.m. on September 15, 2023, a server employed by or acting on behalf of Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses in that hallway. The glasses shattered.

8. The server promptly and quickly picked up the broken glass. She did not clean up, dry, or otherwise remove the water and ice from the tiled floor. She stated aloud to others that she would “be right back with a mop.”

9. The server and/or other restaurant staff did not place any warning sign or barrier (for example, a wet floor sign, cones or other warning) to notify invitees, patrons or employees of the hazardous wet condition.

10. For approximately ten (10) minutes after the glasses were dropped and broken and the water and ice remained on the floor, the wet condition persisted in the hallway. During this time, restaurant staff were aware of the water but did not advise patrons or place warnings. Plaintiff later overheard other staff members saying they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

11. After approximately ten (10) minutes, Plaintiff got up to use the restroom and walked through the narrow hallway toward the kitchen. The floor in the hallway was wet and slippery; the water was observable and could be seen “glistening,” but the Defendant failed to warn Plaintiff or other patrons of the hazard or to barricade or dry the area.

12. While walking through the hallway, Plaintiff stepped onto the wet tile, slipped, and twisted his knee. As a direct and proximate result of the slip and fall, Plaintiff sustained a sprained knee.

13. Plaintiff sought medical treatment the same day at an urgent care facility, where he was diagnosed with a sprained knee and was prescribed a knee brace and physical therapy. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500.00 in medical expenses to date and expects to incur additional treatment-related expenses.

14. As a direct and proximate result of his injury, Plaintiff missed work and lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00.

15. Plaintiff’s injuries, past medical expenses, lost wages and pain and suffering were caused by the negligence of Defendant, its employees, agents and/or representatives, as set forth below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as an invitee and patron of Defendant’s business, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn invitees of dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or should have known, and to take reasonable steps to discover and correct hazards on the Premises. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A; and applicable Massachusetts law recognizing the duty of proprietors to keep invitees safe from unreasonable risks.

18. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. failing to promptly and properly clean, remove, dry or otherwise remedy a hazardous accumulation of water and ice on a tiled hallway;
    b. failing to provide adequate warning of the hazard (for example, wet floor signs, cones, barriers or verbal warnings) to Plaintiff and other patrons despite knowledge that the hazard existed and persisted;
    c. failing to exercise reasonable care in supervising, training and managing its employees and agents with respect to safe procedures for responding to spills and breakages; and
    d. otherwise failing to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees.

19. Defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. The foreseeability of harm from leaving a wet and slippery floor in an area used by patrons is plain: patrons who traverse the hallway risk slipping, falling and suffering injury.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered injury, pain and suffering, incurred medical expenses, and lost earnings and will continue to incur future medical expenses and/or lost wages. Plaintiff claims damages in amounts to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses (approximately $2,500 to date), lost wages (approximately $1,200 to date), pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other compensatory damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses, in an amount to be proven at trial (medical expenses to date approximately $2,500.00);
B. Compensatory damages for past and future lost earnings/wages in an amount to be proven at trial (wages lost to date approximately $1,200.00);
C. Compensatory damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress in an amount to be proven at trial;
D. Interest and costs as permitted by law;
E. Costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees if applicable; and
F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.
