COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties

1.1 Plaintiff: Emily Johnson, domiciled in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant: Michael Smith, currently residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

1.3 Minor child: Jacob Smith, born in 2017, age eight (8).

2. Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s authority to enter and modify orders concerning the custody and visitation of minor children.

2.2 Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the Plaintiff, the Defendant, and the minor child reside in Middlesex County and because the original custody order was entered by this Court.

3. Background and Existing Order

3.1 On May 14, 2019, this Court entered a custody order concerning the parties and their son, Jacob Smith (the “Prior Order”).

3.2 Under the Prior Order the Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody of Jacob. The Defendant was awarded three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit; no overnight parenting time was awarded to the Defendant at that time.

3.3 The current physical custody arrangement continues to reflect that order: Plaintiff has primary physical custody and Defendant has three brief weekday visits and Sunday afternoon visits, with no overnights.

4. Material Change in Circumstances

4.1 Since entry of the Prior Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances with respect to the care and custody of the minor child that was not contemplated by the Court when the Prior Order was entered, including but not limited to the following:

a) The child’s age and needs: Jacob was three years old when the Prior Order was entered (2019). He is now eight years old (2025), is attending school full-time, and his developmental needs and social routines have changed since entry of the Prior Order.

b) Defendant’s changed housing circumstances: At the time the Prior Order was entered the Defendant only had a room in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have a quiet, private sleeping space appropriate for a child. The Defendant now has his own apartment and Jacob has his own bedroom at the Defendant’s residence.

c) The ongoing impact of the existing schedule on the child’s schooling and routine: The current schedule results in frequent short transports on school nights, which interferes with homework, sleep routines, and consistent bedtimes and is causing fatigue and stress for Jacob and for both parents. Jacob has repeatedly expressed a desire to spend real overnights at his father’s home.

d) Mutual agreement of the parties that the parenting schedule should be revised: Both parents agree that the current arrangement no longer fits Jacob’s age and school schedule and that changes—specifically permitting overnight parenting time at the Defendant’s residence and reducing disruptive midweek transfers—would better serve the child’s needs.

4.2 These facts constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting reconsideration and modification of the Prior Order.

5. Best Interests of the Child

5.1 It is in Jacob’s best interests for the Court to modify custody/visitation to reflect his current age, developmental needs, schooling schedule, his expressed wishes to have overnight visits with his father, the Defendant’s now-adequate housing, and the parties’ agreement to a more age-appropriate, less-disruptive schedule.

5.2 The requested modifications will promote stability, reduce unnecessary school-night travel and disruptions to bedtime and homework routines, increase the child’s meaningful contact with the Defendant, and generally serve Jacob’s physical, emotional, and educational welfare.

6. Relief Requested

Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:

6.1 Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Prior Order sufficient to justify modification of the Prior Order.

6.2 Modify the Prior Order to permit overnight parenting time for the Defendant at his residence, to be implemented in a manner consistent with the child’s best interests. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order substantially in the following form (alternative proposals available for the Court’s consideration):

a) Regular schedule: Defendant to have parenting time consisting of (i) one midweek overnight per week (for example, Wednesday evening through Thursday morning) and (ii) alternating weekends (Friday after school or 6:00 p.m. through Sunday evening at 6:00 p.m.), or such other schedule as the Court deems appropriate to accommodate the child’s schooling and extracurricular activities.

b) Transfers and communication: Transfers to be scheduled to minimize school-night disruptions (for example, exchanges on Friday and Sunday evenings) and to include protocols for homework and bedtime routines to ensure continuity.

c) Health and safety: Defendant’s overnight parenting time to be conditioned on maintaining appropriate housing and any other reasonable safety or health measures the Court deems necessary.

6.3 Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including temporary relief pending final hearing if appropriate.

7. Certificate, Notice and Service

7.1 Plaintiff will promptly file proof of service on the Defendant and provide notice in accordance with the rules and orders of this Court.

7.2 Plaintiff certifies that she will comply with all applicable statutes and local rules governing filing, service, and scheduling of modification matters in the Probate and Family Court.

8. Legal Basis (Statement of Legal Principles)

8.1 Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and visitation orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and consistent with the child’s best interests.

8.2 Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court apply Massachusetts law governing custody modifications and the best interests standard. Plaintiff will rely on applicable statutes, court rules, and Massachusetts caselaw addressing modification of custody and visitation, the material-change standard, and the best-interests inquiry at hearing and in any pre-hearing memorandum submitted to the Court.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully prays that this Court:

A. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Prior Order;

B. Modify the Prior Order as requested above to permit overnight parenting time at the Defendant’s residence and to restructure exchanges so as to reduce school-night disruptions and promote Jacob’s best interests;

C. Enter any temporary orders necessary to effectuate such relief pending final hearing; and

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
