COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1.     Parties

1.1    Petitioner: Jessica Thompson, residing in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Petitioner’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2    Respondent: Michael Smith, address unknown to Petitioner for purposes of this pleading but known to the Court and Respondent. Respondent is the other parent of the minor child named below.

1.3    Child: The subject minor child is Ava Smith, age 8 (born 2017). She is a child of the parties and subject to the Court’s custody jurisdiction.

2.     Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1    This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting time orders affecting minor children.

2.2    Venue is proper in Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the parties and the child reside in Barnstable County and the existing custody order was entered by this Court.

3.     Existing Order

3.1    On June 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order awarding Petitioner primary physical custody of the parties’ minor child, Ava, and awarding Respondent parenting time consisting of every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

4.     Material Change in Circumstances

4.1    Since the entry of the 2019 order, Respondent has moved his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school and Petitioner’s residence.

4.2    Respondent nonetheless insists on maintaining the midweek Wednesday overnight created in the 2019 order, and exercises it by picking Ava up from school on Wednesday, driving her approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence, and returning her to school early the next morning (Thursday) for classes.

4.3    As a result of this physical arrangement, Ava is regularly awakened at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings for the return drive and then required to attend school. The travel schedule requires long car rides on school nights and significant early-morning departures.

4.4    The change in Respondent’s residence and the resulting long-distance midweek transportation were not anticipated or envisioned by the parties at the time of the 2019 order. The change has substantially and materially altered the circumstances upon which the Court’s original weekday parenting-time arrangement was based.

5.     Harm to the Child / Best Interests

5.1    The long midweek drives and very early returns have had demonstrable adverse effects on Ava’s health and school functioning. Specifically, Ava has been repeatedly tired on Thursdays and shows reduced participation in class on those days.

5.2    Petitioner has been informed by Ava’s teacher that Ava’s participation and attention on Thursdays has noticeably declined since Respondent began exercising the Wednesday overnight in the current manner.

5.3    The child’s present schedule of transportation and sleep deprivation raises significant concerns regarding her physical well-being, school performance, and overall best interests.

6.     Legal Standard

6.1    Under Massachusetts law, a court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and where modification is in the child’s best interests. Petitioner alleges that Respondent’s relocation and the operational effect of the current midweek overnight constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the existing order.

6.2    Petitioner requests that the Court evaluate the current arrangement in light of the child’s best interests and the evidence of harm and fatigue described above, and exercise its authority to modify the custody/parenting-time order accordingly.

7.     Relief Requested

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order that includes the following relief:

7.1    Enter a finding that there has been a material change in circumstances since the June 15, 2019 custody order sufficient to permit modification of the parenting-time provisions of that order.

7.2    Eliminate Respondent’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time (the Wednesday-to-Thursday overnight) presently contained in the June 15, 2019 order, or, in the alternative, modify that weekday parenting time in a manner that avoids long school-night travel and early-morning returns that interfere with the child’s sleep and school functioning (for example, converting midweek contact to an alternative form of contact such as an in-town same-day visit, virtual/telephone contact, or a non-overnight exchange that allows the child to remain in her primary residence overnight).

7.3    Modify Respondent’s weekend parenting time schedule as necessary to compensate for the change above and to ensure the child is not subjected to long school-night drives; such modification may include adjusting pick-up/drop-off times, exchanging at a mutually agreeable midpoint, or otherwise tailoring exchanges to avoid excessive travel on school nights.

7.4    Award such further relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect the health, safety, and best interests of the minor child, including any orders for transportation arrangements, school communication, or input from the child’s teacher or a qualified professional regarding the child’s sleep and school functioning.

7.5    Grant Petitioner such other and further relief as the Court finds just and proper, including costs and reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable.

8.     Notice and Certificate of Service

8.1    Petitioner will serve a copy of this Complaint on Respondent pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules and the Probate and Family Court rules and will file a certificate of service with the Court.

Respectfully submitted,
