COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by way of Complaint against Defendant Mark Stevens ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Stevens is an individual who resides or may be served in Massachusetts. Plaintiff will effectuate service of process on Defendant at his last known address.

3. The events giving rise to this Complaint occurred on September 15, 2023, at Hammond Pond Parkway, Newton, Massachusetts 02467, which is within the territorial jurisdiction of the Newton District Court. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court.

4. This action is timely filed within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury claims in Massachusetts. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging along a marked walking/jogging path in the public park area of Hammond Pond Parkway in Newton, Massachusetts.

6. The park contained visible signage requiring dogs to be on leashes (the "leash signs"). The signs were publicly posted and observable on the path or nearby.

7. Defendant is an individual who regularly visited the park with his large dog. Despite posted leash rules, Defendant had a practice of allowing his dog to run off-leash.

8. On September 15, 2023, Defendant's dog was running loose in the park. Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away from his dog, conversing with friends and holding the dog’s leash slung over his shoulder but not attached to the dog. Defendant made no effective effort to secure or control the dog at that time.

9. The dog suddenly charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and behaving in an aggressive manner. Plaintiff felt threatened and reasonably believed the dog might bite or otherwise attack her.

10. To avoid being bitten or attacked by the dog, Plaintiff swerved off the paved path to evade the charging animal. In the course of swerving, Plaintiff tripped over a raised tree root and fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path.

11. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist requiring emergency treatment, including an emergency room visit and follow-up care. Plaintiff was placed in a brace for several weeks, incurred medical expenses, and was restricted from working and certain activities during her recovery.

12. The dog did not actually bite Plaintiff; it stopped its approach when Plaintiff fell and Defendant called the dog back. Several other joggers witnessed the entire incident and can testify to the facts described herein.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligent conduct in failing to control his dog and allowing it to run loose in violation of the posted leash requirement, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other economic and non-economic damages.

INJURIES AND DAMAGES

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:
   a. Fractured wrist requiring emergency room treatment and follow-up care;
   b. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $4,500;
   c. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200 due to missed work;
   d. Pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial;
   e. Incidental expenses and other economic losses; and
   f. Interest, costs, and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as though fully set forth herein.

16. Defendant owed Plaintiff—and all lawful users of the park—a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, including a duty to keep his dog under reasonable control, to comply with posted leash rules, and to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm to others on the park path.

17. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things:
   a. Allowing his dog to run loose and unsupervised in an area with posted leash requirements;
   b. Failing to physically restrain or control his dog while it was in a public area frequented by joggers and other pedestrians;
   c. Failing to take prompt action to call, secure, or restrain the dog when it behaved aggressively or charged a park user; and
   d. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care for the safety of park patrons.

18. Defendant’s breach was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. Defendant’s conduct made it reasonably foreseeable that an unleashed, large dog could approach or charge a park user and thereby cause the user to take evasive action, potentially resulting in a fall and physical injury.

19. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the injuries and damages described above.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:
   1. Past and future medical expenses (approximately $4,500 past medical expenses to date, with future medical expenses to be proven at trial);
   2. Past and future lost wages and lost earning capacity (approximately $1,200 past wages, with future losses to be proven at trial);
   3. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Award prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award costs of suit, reasonable attorneys' fees if applicable, and other costs allowable by law;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff intends to rely on Massachusetts negligence law and related authorities to establish duty, breach, causation, and damages. Relevant authorities include, without limitation, the Massachusetts statute of limitations for personal injury actions and well-established tort principles regarding duty and breach by owners of animals and the standard of reasonable care. Examples of authorities Plaintiff may cite at trial (to be supplemented and verified in the course of litigation) include:

Statutes and Restatement authorities
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 7 (scope of liability for conduct);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282 (duty to exercise care);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302B (duty owed by possessor of land to invitees);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 518–520 (liability for negligence causing physical harm).

Massachusetts cases and persuasive authorities addressing negligence principles and standards of care (examples to be developed and cited with precise citations in litigation):
- Brown v. Kendall (classic Massachusetts case explaining negligence standard);
- Cases of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreting duty and breach in personal injury/animal control contexts and applying proximate cause and foreseeability principles (Plaintiff will rely on controlling SJC and Appeals Court authority regarding duty, negligence, and proximate cause);
- Contemporary Massachusetts decisions addressing liability of owners for harms caused by animals or by their failure to control animals in public spaces, and decisions addressing negligence by persons whose conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm to others.

(Notes: Plaintiff reserves the right to add additional statutes, ordinances (including any Newton municipal leash bylaw or park regulation), Restatement sections, and Massachusetts case authority following further legal research and discovery.)

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

I certify that a copy of this Complaint will be served upon Defendant in accordance with the applicable rules.
