It does not discuss premises liability, duties owed by a landowner to people using an adjacent sidewalk, or any negligence/apportionment-of-fault issues. Therefore it does not provide authority for the asserted duty-to-sidewalk-users proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In enacting the anti-SLAPP statute, \u201cthe Legislature intended to immunize parties from claims \u2018based on\u2019 their petitioning activities.\u201d Duracraft Corp. v. Holmes Prods. Corp., 427 Mass. 156, 167 (1998). Accordingly, the statute provides broad protections for individuals who exercise their right to petition from harassing litigation and the costs and burdens of defending against retaliatory lawsuits. Id. at 161-162. In this regard, they are similar in purpose to the protections afforded public officials by the doctrine of governmental immunity."
