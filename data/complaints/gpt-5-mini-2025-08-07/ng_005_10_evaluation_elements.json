    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant owned/controlled/placed the ladder adjacent to the shared driveway (\u00b62) and expressly pleads a duty to exercise reasonable care in storing/securing the ladder (\u00b614), including to avoid foreseeable risks to persons or property using the driveway."

    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads that on March 15, 2023 a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to fall and strike Plaintiff\u2019s automobile (\u00b69) and alleges the fall resulted from Defendant\u2019s failure to secure the ladder (\u00b616); thus but-for the failure to secure, the ladder would not have fallen and struck the car."
