COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jessica Thomas ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Lynnwood Apartments, Inc. ("Defendant" or "Lynnwood"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, VENUE, AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thomas is an individual and a resident of Lynn, Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides in Unit 3 on the third floor of the apartment building located at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

2. Defendant Lynnwood Apartments, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation (or business entity) that owns and manages the apartment building located at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905, where Plaintiff resides.

3. The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred on September 12, 2023, at the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

4. Venue is proper in the Lynn District Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. rules governing venue and pursuant to applicable Massachusetts statutes because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Lynn and the property is situated in Lynn.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, occupied, managed, and/or controlled the apartment building located at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, and had possession, control, and responsibility for the common areas of that building, including the common hallway and corridors outside of individual units.

6. As landlord and manager of the building, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff and other lawful residents and invitees to maintain the common areas of the premises in a reasonably safe condition, to exercise reasonable care to discover dangerous conditions, and to repair or warn of such dangerous conditions in a timely manner. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 314A, 343; Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928).

7. Massachusetts law and applicable state and local building and fire codes impose duties on owners and managers of multi-family residential buildings to provide, install, and maintain functioning smoke detectors and fire safety devices in common areas and in a manner sufficient to provide timely warning to occupants. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 148; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (State Fire Code); 780 CMR (Massachusetts State Building Code); 527 CMR (Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code). (Authorities cited below address legal duties relevant to smoke detectors and fire safety.)

8. For months prior to September 12, 2023, a hallway smoke detector located immediately outside Plaintiff’s unit on the third floor intermittently emitted a low-battery “chirping” sound indicating the detector’s battery was low or failing.

9. On multiple occasions (at least three), Plaintiff informed the building’s landlord/management (Defendant) about the chirping/low battery and requested repair or replacement of the detector or replacement of its battery. Each time, Defendant or its agents responded that Defendant would "take care of it" but did not do so.

10. At some point prior to September 12, 2023, an unknown person removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector and left the battery sitting on a windowsill in the common hallway. The detector was left without a battery and was thereby inoperable and incapable of sounding an alarm.

11. On the night of September 12, 2023, a fire originated in a first-floor apartment in the building at or near 150 Maple Street (the “Fire”). The source of the Fire was an appliance or item in the first-floor apartment’s kitchen (the exact cause of which is not at this time known to Plaintiff).

12. Because the common hallway smoke detector directly outside Plaintiff’s unit had no battery and was inoperable, it failed to detect the Fire or provide any audible warning to occupants on the upper floors, including Plaintiff.

13. Plaintiff first became aware of the Fire when she smelled smoke while attempting to exit her unit. By the time Plaintiff became aware, the hallway and stairwell were already thick with smoke, impeding evacuation and significantly increasing the risk of injury.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector and to respond to repeated notifications of the defective detector, Plaintiff suffered injury from smoke inhalation, experienced difficulty breathing, required emergency medical care and hospitalization for smoke inhalation, and suffered damage to personal property from smoke and firefighting water.

15. Plaintiff’s reasonably related medical expenses to date total approximately $5,200. Plaintiff also lost wages of approximately $1,000 as a direct result of injuries and medical treatment necessitated by the Fire and resultant smoke inhalation.

16. Plaintiff has suffered past and ongoing physical pain, mental anguish, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance and inspection of the premises, including a duty to maintain and repair smoke detection devices in common areas so as to provide timely warning of fire to building occupants. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 314A, 343; Donoghue v. Stevenson, supra; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., supra; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 148; 780 CMR; 527 CMR.

19. Defendant breached this duty by negligently failing to maintain the hallway smoke detector, by failing to replace a known low battery, by allowing the detector to be rendered inoperable (including by permitting removal of its battery), and by failing to take reasonable remedial action after being put on notice by Plaintiff and other tenants that the detector was failing to operate properly.

20. Defendant’s breaches constitute negligent acts and omissions that created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and other lawful residents of the building.

21. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. Had Defendant exercised reasonable care by promptly repairing or replacing the detector after notification, or by otherwise ensuring the detector was in operating condition, Plaintiff would have received timely warning of the Fire and would not have suffered the same degree of injury, or such injuries might have been avoided altogether.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:
   a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,200;
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000;
   c. Damage to and loss of personal property from smoke and water (amount to be proven at trial);
   d. Past and future physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience (amount to be proven at trial);
   e. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thomas requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Lynnwood Apartments, Inc., as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to approximately $5,200 in medical expenses and $1,000 in lost wages as presently known;

B. Awarding interest, costs, and disbursements allowed by law;

C. Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
