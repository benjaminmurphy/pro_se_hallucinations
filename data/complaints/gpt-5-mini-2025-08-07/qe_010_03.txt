COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Tenancy — 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA)

Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Turner”) is an individual and a resident of Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is:
   - Address: 123 Maple Street, Apartment __, Lowell, MA 01852
   - Phone: (617) 555-0123
   - Email: psm1433@gmail.com

2. Defendant Linda Martinez (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Premises”), which she rents to Plaintiff.

3. The parties entered into a residential tenancy commencing on June 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,300.00.

4. Venue is proper in Lowell District Court because the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts and the acts and omissions giving rise to this complaint occurred in Lowell.

Statement of Claim

5. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive/declaratory relief for Defendant’s substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises resulting from persistent and worsening mold conditions in the bathroom and Defendant’s refusal to remediate underlying causes of the mold or to provide effective ventilation.

Allegations of Fact

6. Plaintiff has leased and occupied the Premises as her primary residence since June 1, 2022.

7. Beginning in approximately [month/year mold first observed — Plaintiff reports onset prior to filing], Plaintiff observed mold growth at the corner of the shower in the bathroom. Over time the mold spread to the bathroom ceiling.

8. The bathroom in Plaintiff’s unit is an interior bathroom with no window; the only mechanical ventilation is an exhaust fan.

9. Plaintiff reported the mold problem to Defendant and requested remediation and correction of any underlying causes, including improper or inadequate ventilation.

10. Defendant inspected the bathroom, observed the mold, and indicated she would clean the visible mold. Defendant refused to replace or otherwise repair or upgrade the bathroom ventilation, stating that Plaintiff had caused the mold by not running the exhaust fan “enough” and by taking showers that were “too hot and too long.”

11. Plaintiff reasonably uses the bathroom for normal activities, including taking showers. Plaintiff runs the exhaust fan when she showers; any occasional failure to run the fan every single time was not an abnormal use of the premises and does not justify Defendant’s refusal to remediate.

12. Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced new respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing. Plaintiff has never previously had these symptoms. Plaintiff sought medical care, and her treating clinician advised that the symptoms were consistent with exposure to mold and recommended remediation of the mold.

13. As a direct result of the mold growth, Plaintiff disposed of a shower curtain and towels that became moldy, at a loss of approximately $60.00.

14. Defendant’s refusal to address the cause of the mold (i.e., failure to provide adequate ventilation and to remedy conditions leading to mold growth) and her insistence that Plaintiff is solely at fault have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet, comfortable, and safe possession and use of the Premises.

15. Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to notify Defendant and to obtain remediation without litigation but Defendant has refused to correct the ventilation problem or to take adequate measures to prevent recurrence after cleaning.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to property loss (shower curtain and towels), physical symptoms and related distress, diminution in the value and habitability of the tenancy, and loss of the benefit of quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

Cause of Action
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law — Massachusetts)

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1–16.

18. Under Massachusetts common law, every residential tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment — that is, the right to possession and use of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing landlord responsibilities to maintain premises in habitable condition and establishing principles applied in many jurisdictions), and Massachusetts authorities recognizing the landlord’s obligations to provide tenants with occupied premises fit for normal residential use.

19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached where a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including where conditions render the premises unsafe, unhealthy, or uninhabitable, or where the landlord refuses to correct dangerous or unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Javins, supra; see also 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), which establishes standards for ventilation and freedom from conditions conducive to the growth of mold and other hazards to health.

20. Defendant’s refusal to remediate the cause of the mold and to provide adequate ventilation — and her blaming Plaintiff rather than fixing the ventilation or undertaking proper remediation — constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

21. Defendant’s breach was an actual and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages, including physical symptoms, property loss, loss of quiet enjoyment, and other consequential damages.

22. Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be determined at trial but, on information and belief and based on Plaintiff’s reasonable calculation, not less than $200.00 for loss of use, property damage, and diminution in the value of the tenancy, plus other damages and injunctive relief as set forth below.

Applicable Statutes, Regulations, and Authorities

23. Plaintiff relies on and incorporates by reference the following authorities as relevant to the legal standard for habitability, health and safety standards, and the landlord’s duties regarding sanitary and fitness standards:
   - M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord and Tenant)
   - M.G.L. c. 186, §§ 14–26 (provisions generally governing residential tenancies and landlord-tenant relations)
   - M.G.L. c. 111 (Sanitary Code enabling statute)
   - 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
   - Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognized nationwide as central authority on implied warranty of habitability and landlord duties)
   - Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (housing habitability and tenant remedies; persuasive authority)
   - Other persuasive authorities discussing breach of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties to remedy habitability and environmental health hazards (e.g., mold), including decisions and treatises addressing constructive eviction, diminution of value, and equitable relief in landlord-tenant disputes.

Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff by failing to correct and prevent the mold conditions and by refusing to provide adequate ventilation for the bathroom;

B. An order (injunctive relief and/or declaratory relief) directing Defendant to:
   1. Remediate all visible and hidden mold in Plaintiff’s unit using appropriate professional remediation methods;
   2. Inspect, repair, replace, or upgrade the bathroom exhaust fan and any other mechanical ventilation necessary to ensure compliance with applicable health and building standards; and
   3. Take all reasonable measures to prevent recurrence (including, if necessary, ongoing monitoring and verification of ventilation effectiveness and mold-free conditions);

C. Actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including at least $200.00 in compensatory damages for property loss, diminution in value of the tenancy, and other losses caused by Defendant’s breach;

D. Costs of suit and court fees allowable by law;

E. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and

F. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Jury Demand

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
