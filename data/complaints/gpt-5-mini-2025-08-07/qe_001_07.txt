JASMINE CARTER,                                 
    Plaintiff,                                  
                                                 Civil Action No.: _________________
v.
                                                 COMPLAINT
MICHAEL THOMPSON,                               
    Defendant.                                  

COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Jasmine Carter, and alleges the following against the Defendant, Michael Thompson:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Jasmine Carter (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and a resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124 (the “Premises”), where Plaintiff resides pursuant to a tenancy that began on March 1, 2022.

3. Plaintiff pays Defendant monthly rent of $1,800.00.

4. The Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, has jurisdiction pursuant to the court’s statutory grant to hear landlord–tenant and related civil actions (see generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239), and venue is proper in the Dorchester Division because the Premises are located in Dorchester and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Plaintiff is a tenant at the Premises and has occupied the two‑bedroom apartment since March 1, 2022.

6. During the winter of 2024–2025 (including January 2025), the heating system at the Premises repeatedly failed to maintain a reasonable and adequate indoor temperature. On numerous evenings, the heat in the apartment would drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for periods of a few hours at a time.

7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating problem. Defendant arranged for repairs on two separate occasions. On the first visit, a repair person performed work and the heat functioned adequately for about one week thereafter. When the problem recurred, Defendant sent a second repair person who inspected the boiler and stated that the boiler was “old but functional” and that there was “not much more to do.”

8. Despite the two repair visits, the heating deficiency recurred and continued to substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises during the cold months. The intermittent but recurring inadequate heat rendered the apartment unreasonably uncomfortable and unsafe at times.

9. To make the apartment livable during periods when the heat dropped, Plaintiff purchased two portable electric space heaters at her own expense. The space heaters caused Plaintiff’s monthly electric bills to increase by approximately $150.00 per month during the period in which she relied on them.

10. In January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis. Plaintiff’s treating physician advised that the illness was likely exacerbated by the prolonged exposure to cold indoor air in the apartment. Plaintiff missed three days of work as a result of her illness and incurred out‑of‑pocket medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics.

11. Defendant has refused to accept that the intermittent loss of adequate heat constitutes a materially unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy, maintaining that because the heat did not go completely out and the building was “not freezing,” the heating system is “working.”

12. Defendant was on actual notice of the inadequate heating (by Plaintiff’s reports and the multiple repair visits) and had the opportunity to undertake further remedial measures to provide reasonably adequate heat but failed to do so. The failure to provide and maintain adequate heat substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

13. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts common law, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, an implied covenant in the landlord–tenant relationship that the tenant’s possession will not be substantially and unreasonably interfered with by the landlord. A landlord who fails to remedy substantial interferences with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises after notice breaches this covenant. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing that tenants’ right to habitable conditions and quiet enjoyment is an implied covenant enforceable by tenants); see also authorities cited below.

15. The intermittent but recurring failure of the heating system to maintain reasonable indoor temperatures, despite Defendant’s awareness and two repair attempts, constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. The interference was not de minimis; it required Plaintiff to expend funds for supplemental heating, increased her utility costs, and contributed to adverse health consequences (bronchitis), and lost wages.

16. By failing to provide and maintain adequate heating and failing to take reasonable remedial measures after receiving notice, Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s obligations owed to Plaintiff as a tenant under Massachusetts law.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer economic damages (including the increased electric bills totaling approximately $150.00/month for the period of reliance on space heaters, out‑of‑pocket medical costs, and lost wages for three days of work) and non‑economic harms (loss of use and enjoyment, discomfort, and aggravation).

18. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff estimates her compensable damages to be $1,450.00. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this amount following further discovery and proof at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $1,450.00 (or in an amount proven at trial);

B. Costs of suit and filing fees;

C. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

(Notes: The foregoing authorities are cited as representative legal principles supporting Plaintiff’s single cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff intends to rely on Massachusetts common law recognizing the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment together with the housing standards reflected in 105 CMR 410.000 and related statutory authority (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111) to prove that Defendant’s recurring failure to provide adequate heat materially interfered with Plaintiff’s tenancy and thus constituted a breach.)
