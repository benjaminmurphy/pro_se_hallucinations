      "support_reasoning": "Brown v. Kendall is a foundational negligence case, but it does not involve premises liability, land possessors, or duties to keep land in a reasonably safe condition as addressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 343 and 343A, nor does it discuss statutes of limitations. The opinion\u2019s contribution is the general negligence standard (ordinary care, burden of proof, contributory negligence) in an unintentional battery context. Thus, it supports the broad idea that negligence principles apply to actions causing injury, but not the specific land\u2011possessor duty or statute\u2011of\u2011limitations points mentioned in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe think, as the result of all the authorities, the rule is correctly stated by Mr. Greenleaf, that the plaintiff must come prepared with evidence to show either that the intention was unlawful, or that the defendant was in fault; for if the injury was unavoidable, and the conduct of the defendant was free from blame, he will not be liable.\u2026 If the act of hitting the plaintiff was unintentional\u2026 then the defendant was not liable, unless it was done in the want of exercise of due care\u2026 and therefore such want of due care became part of the plaintiff's case\u2026\u201d"

      "supports_proposition": true,
      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The proposition characterizes Palsgraf as an illustrative discussion of proximate cause. In this excerpt, Cardozo explicitly treats the scope-of-duty/foreseeability question as conceptually prior to proximate cause and then addresses causation doctrine, making the case a classic source for proximate cause analysis. Although Cardozo ultimately describes the issue as one of duty rather than proximate cause, the opinion is routinely cited for its proximate cause discussion, so the citation is accurate for an illustrative purpose.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort. We may assume, without deciding, that negligence, not at large or in the abstract, but in relation to the plaintiff, would entail liability for any and all consequences, however novel or extraordinary\u2026\u201d"
