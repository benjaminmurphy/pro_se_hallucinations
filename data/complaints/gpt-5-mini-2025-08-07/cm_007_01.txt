v.                                                  Docket No. ____________

Daniel Thompson
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Rachel Thompson (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Rachel”), whose address for purposes of service is on file with the Court, brings this Complaint against Defendant Daniel Thompson (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Daniel”).
1.2 The minor child subject to this action is Emily Thompson, born in 2013 (age 12) (hereinafter “the Child”).
1.3 Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the Parties and the Child reside in Norfolk County and the original custody order was entered by this Court on May 15, 2018.

2. Nature of Action
2.1 This is an action for modification of a custody order pursuant to Massachusetts statutory and decisional law governing child custody and modification of custody orders. Plaintiff seeks a change in the current physical custody arrangement on the grounds that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the existing order that affects the Child’s safety, welfare and best interests.

3. Prior Order
3.1 On May 15, 2018, this Court entered an order for joint legal custody and equal physical parenting time awarding the Parties alternating one week on/one week off physical custody of the Child (the “2018 Order”).
3.2 Under the 2018 Order the Parties shared 50/50 physical custody with weekly exchanges between households.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the 2018 Order, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred.
4.2 Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has resulted in significant balance and mobility impairment. Within the past year Defendant has experienced multiple falls at home and requires a wheelchair and physical assistance for transfers.
4.3 Defendant’s treating physician has advised that Defendant should not be left alone with the Child in situations involving stairs, steps, or where a rapid physical response would be required to protect the Child from an injury.
4.4 Despite the medical diagnosis and the treating physician’s advice, Defendant insists on maintaining the exact same alternating-week 50/50 parenting schedule and, on multiple occasions, has relied on the Child (age 12) to assist Defendant with physical tasks including transferring from a wheelchair to bed and fetching and carrying items during Defendant’s custodial time.
4.5 The need to use a child to assist with transfers and to provide physical assistance places undue responsibility on the Child and has exposed the Child to safety risks including the risk of falls and injury.
4.6 The change in Defendant’s health, functional capacity, and the attendant risks to the Child’s safety and welfare constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of physical custody and parenting time.

5. Best Interests of the Child
5.1 In light of the material change in circumstances described above, modification of the 2018 Order is necessary to protect the Child’s safety and to serve the Child’s best interests.
5.2 Plaintiff alleges that a primary physical custody arrangement with reasonable, tailored parenting time for Defendant that is consistent with Defendant’s capabilities and medically recommended restrictions is in the Child’s best interests.
5.3 Plaintiff alleges further that the Child’s routines, schooling, extracurricular activities, and emotional well-being are best served by a stable primary residence with Plaintiff while Defendant has parenting time that can be exercised safely (e.g., daytime visits when appropriate assistance is available, supervised visits if the Court deems necessary, virtual contact, and avoidance of unsupervised care near stairs or during transfers).

6. Relief Requested — Modification Sought
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
6.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2018 Order sufficient to permit modification of physical custody;
6.2 Modify the 2018 Order to award primary physical custody of the Child to Plaintiff, with Defendant to have reasonable parenting time consistent with the Child’s best interests and Defendant’s medical limitations, which may include:
     a) Daytime parenting time that accommodates Defendant’s mobility and safety needs (for example, supervised or assisted visits at Defendant’s residence only when an able adult is present to assist with transfers, or visits at a neutral location);
     b) Prohibition against Defendant being alone with the Child in situations involving stairs, transfers, bathing, or any circumstance where rapid physical response is required, unless a responsible adult designated by the Parties or approved by the Court is present;
     c) Temporary supervised visitation or participation of a professional caregiver or family member until Defendant can demonstrate, by physician’s certification, an ability to care for the Child safely during the scheduled parenting time;
     d) Reasonable accommodations for virtual contact (telephone, video conferencing) to preserve the parent-child relationship when in-person parenting time is unsafe or impracticable;
6.3 Order Defendant to provide the Court and Plaintiff with current medical documentation from Defendant’s treating physician describing functional limitations relevant to child care, and to update such documentation periodically as the Court requires;
6.4 Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including allocation of costs and such temporary orders (pendente lite) as may be necessary to protect the Child pending final resolution.

7. Supporting Authorities
Plaintiff relies upon the governing Massachusetts statutory standards and controlling authorities regarding modification of custody orders, the child’s best interests, the duty to protect a child’s safety, and the Court’s broad equitable powers to fashion custody and parenting-time arrangements responsive to changed circumstances. Relevant authorities include, without limitation:
Statutes, Rules, and Doctrines
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (provisions governing custody and matters ancillary to divorce and domestic relations)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A (duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect)
- Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Rules and Domestic Relations Practice (as applicable to custody modification and temporary relief)
- The “best interests of the child” standard as applied in Massachusetts custody jurisprudence
Representative Massachusetts Decisions (illustrative and non-exhaustive)
- Custody modification precedent recognizing that a material change in circumstances justifies modification where the child’s welfare or safety is implicated (see, e.g., long-standing Massachusetts authority applying the “material change” standard and best-interests analysis)
- Decisions addressing parental physical incapacity or illness as a basis for custody modification where the child’s safety and best interests are affected
- Massachusetts appellate decisions recognizing the Court’s authority to order supervised visitation, restrictions on unsupervised parenting time, and medical documentation where parental health impacts caretaking ability
(At hearing, Plaintiff will cite and rely upon specific statutory sections, rules, and relevant Massachusetts case law, including decisions that articulate the material-change and best-interests standards and that authorize supervised or restricted parenting time where necessary to protect a child.)

8. Request for Hearing and Temporary Relief
8.1 Plaintiff requests a prompt hearing on this Complaint.
8.2 Given the documented safety concerns posed by Defendant’s falls and reliance on the Child for physical assistance, Plaintiff requests temporary pendente lite relief restricting Defendant’s unsupervised custodial periods and providing temporary primary physical custody to Plaintiff pending final determination, or alternative interim arrangements that the Court deems necessary to protect the Child.

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the 2018 Order sufficient to permit modification of custody;
B. Modify the 2018 Order to award primary physical custody of Emily Thompson to Plaintiff;
C. Establish parenting time for Defendant that is reasonable, safe, consistent with Defendant’s medical restrictions and the Child’s best interests, which may include supervised or assisted visits and virtual contact as appropriate;
D. Order Defendant to provide medical documentation and to comply with any Court-ordered assessments or supervised visitation requirements;
E. Grant temporary pendente lite relief as necessary to ensure the Child’s safety pending final resolution;
F. Award any other relief the Court considers just and equitable.

Date: December 1, 2025
