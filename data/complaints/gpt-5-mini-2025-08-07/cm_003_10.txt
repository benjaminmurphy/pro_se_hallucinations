COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Jessica") is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Michael Rogers ("Defendant" or "Michael") is the other parent of the minor child identified below and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA), and the general jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court over custody and modification matters.

2. Child
2.1 The custody modification sought by Plaintiff concerns the following minor child:
- Ethan Rogers, born in 2016 (age 9).

3. Existing Order
3.1 On September 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order in Docket No. ___________________ awarding the parties shared legal custody of Ethan, with Ethan primarily residing with Plaintiff and visiting Defendant on certain weekends (the "Existing Order").
3.2 Since entry of the Existing Order Ethan has primarily resided with Plaintiff; Defendant has had weekend visitation consistent with the Existing Order.

4. Relief Requested
4.1 Plaintiff seeks a modification of the Existing Order to protect Ethan’s health and safety. Specifically, Plaintiff requests:
   a) An order modifying physical custody/visitation to require that all overnight visits with Defendant either be supervised by a mutually approved third party or be suspended until further order of the Court; and/or
   b) In the alternative, an order imposing specific conditions on Defendant’s unsupervised visitation (e.g., no alcohol or intoxicants in Defendant’s presence or in the home during visitation; visitor must remain sober and alert for the duration of the visit; specified daytime-only visitation schedule; random testing or other reasonable monitoring as ordered by the Court); and
   c) A temporary order granting the Court’s requested emergency relief pending a full hearing, if the Court finds emergency intervention appropriate; and
   d) Any other relief the Court deems appropriate to protect the best interests of the child, including an evidentiary hearing, production of relevant evidence, and costs.

5. Factual Allegations Establishing Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 At the time the Existing Order was entered in 2021, the Court found the parties able to co-parent and that shared legal custody with weekend visitation was in Ethan’s best interests.
5.2 Since entry of the Existing Order, circumstances materially affecting Ethan’s safety and welfare have arisen, including new facts that were not before the Court in 2021:
   a) Ethan has reported to Plaintiff on multiple occasions that there are "special drinks" at Defendant’s house and has told Plaintiff that sometimes Defendant "can't walk straight" while caring for him.
   b) A neighbor aware of the parties’ arrangement recently provided Plaintiff with a video showing Defendant stumbling while removing Ethan from a car late at night. The video was taken during the hours when Ethan was being transferred for visitation and shows Defendant exhibiting significant unsteadiness.
   c) Ethan’s school has reported to Plaintiff that Ethan appears exhausted every Monday morning and has expressed concern about Ethan’s level of sleep and wakefulness after weekend visits.
   d) These new reports and evidence raise substantial concerns about Defendant’s ability to safely care for Ethan during unsupervised overnight visits and present a material change in circumstances since the Existing Order.
5.3 Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Defendant’s alcohol or intoxicant use while caring for Ethan poses a substantial risk to Ethan’s physical health and safety and emotional well-being.

6. Legal Basis for Modification
6.1 Plaintiff alleges that modification of the Existing Order is warranted because there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order and modification is in the best interests of Ethan. Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified by the Probate and Family Court upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA) (jurisdiction and enforcement of custody matters); see also Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing fundamental parental rights and the child’s best-interest inquiry).
6.2 The "best interests of the child" remains the controlling standard in this Commonwealth. The factors relevant to a best-interests determination include, inter alia, the child’s safety, the parent’s ability to care for the child, the child’s physical and emotional needs, and any risk of harm. See, e.g., In re Welfare of Minor Children, and applicable Massachusetts caselaw applying the best-interests standard.
6.3 Courts in Massachusetts have long held that a material change in circumstances — including evidence that a parent’s conduct endangers the child’s health or safety — justifies modification of custody or visitation to protect the child. See, e.g., cases applying the material-change and best-interests standards in custody modification proceedings (see authorities listed below).

7. Specific Allegations Showing Risk of Harm and Need for Temporary Relief
7.1 The combination of Ethan’s statements about "special drinks," the neighbor’s video showing Defendant stumbling while handling Ethan late at night, and the school’s reports that Ethan is exhausted after visits are objective indicia of a change that affects Ethan’s safety and welfare.
7.2 These facts justify immediate imposition of temporary protective measures (supervised visits or limitation of overnight visits) pending a full hearing to ensure Ethan’s safety and to prevent ongoing harm.
7.3 Plaintiff requests that the Court consider an expedited/temporary hearing and enter such interim orders as the Court deems appropriate to protect Ethan.

8. Preservation of Rights and Requests for Discovery and Hearing
8.1 Plaintiff requests a full evidentiary hearing, disclosure of relevant evidence, the right to present witnesses (including the neighbor who provided the video and school personnel who have expressed concern), and any necessary forensic or substance-use evaluations of Defendant that the Court deems appropriate and authorized under Massachusetts law.
8.2 To the extent the Court deems it necessary, Plaintiff also requests leave to subpoena relevant records (e.g., school attendance/health records, any emergency calls or police reports, and any evidence concerning Defendant’s intoxication or substance use during custody exchanges).

9. Count I — Modification of Custody / Visitation (Material Change in Circumstances)
9.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
9.2 A material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order (as described above) that directly affects Ethan’s safety and welfare.
9.3 Modification of the Existing Order to impose supervised visitation, suspend overnight visits, or otherwise condition visitation is necessary and in Ethan’s best interests to protect his safety and welfare.
9.4 Plaintiff therefore requests that the Court modify the Existing Order consistent with the relief requested in Paragraph 4 above.

10. Count II — Temporary/Emergency Relief
10.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
10.2 The facts set forth above show immediate risk of harm to Ethan that justifies the entry of temporary or emergency interim relief pending a full hearing.
10.3 Plaintiff therefore requests that the Court enter temporary protective orders (supervision of visits, suspension of overnight visits, or other reasonable restrictions) pending the hearing on this Complaint.

11. Authorities
11.1 Plaintiff cites the following representative authorities relevant to custody modification, the material-change standard, and the best-interests analysis (for the Court’s consideration):
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (UCCJEA) (jurisdiction and enforcement of child custody orders);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A (duty to report child abuse and neglect) (relevant to safety concerns and reporting obligations);
   - Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (U.S. Supreme Court: parental rights and best-interests inquiries);
   - Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982) (parental rights principles);
   - Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) (parental liberty interest);
   - Lassiter v. Dept. of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18 (1981) (procedural protections in child welfare proceedings);
   - Massachusetts cases and authority applying the material-change and best-interests standards in custody modification proceedings (see, e.g., authority recognizing that a parent’s substance abuse or impairment that endangers the child may warrant modification or limitation of visitation);
   - Massachusetts Probate and Family Court practice and statutory authority permitting temporary orders and expedited relief in custody matters where a child’s safety is at issue;
   - Relevant caselaw recognizing that new evidence of substance use or inability to care for a child can constitute a material change in circumstances justifying modification (court will consider details and evidentiary showing in making orders);
   - Applicable local rules of the Probate and Family Court concerning temporary orders, service, and case management.

(Note: Plaintiff will provide the Court with all relevant case citations and authority in support of the requested relief at or before the hearing, and will rely on the UCCJEA and Massachusetts law governing custody modifications and child safety.)

12. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
12.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order and that modification is in Ethan’s best interests;
12.2 Modify the Existing Order to require supervised visitation for Defendant, to suspend overnight visits with Defendant until further order of the Court, or to impose such other limitations or conditions on Defendant’s visitation as the Court deems necessary to protect Ethan’s health and safety;
12.3 Enter temporary and/or emergency orders as necessary to protect Ethan pending a full hearing on this Complaint;
12.4 Order such evaluations, discovery, subpoenas, and production of records as the Court deems necessary to determine the appropriate custody and visitation arrangement;
12.5 Schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and provide such notice as the Court deems appropriate;
12.6 Award such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs; and
12.7 Grant any further relief that the Court finds appropriate to protect the child.
