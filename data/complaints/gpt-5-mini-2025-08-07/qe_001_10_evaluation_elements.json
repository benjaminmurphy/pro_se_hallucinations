    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff has rented the apartment since January 1, 2022 on a month-to-month tenancy and pays monthly rent to Defendant, and identifies Defendant as owner/landlord of the Premises\u2014facts that sufficiently plead a landlord\u2011tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges affirmative conduct and omissions by Defendant: he arranged repairs on two occasions but did not remedy intermittent heating failures and asserted the heat was \"working,\" which sufficiently alleges landlord acts/omissions in maintaining essential services."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges recurring temperature drops to ~60\u00b0F for several hours on multiple evenings, describes the apartment as unreasonably cold, and ties the condition to impaired use (space heaters, increased bills, illness)\u2014facts adequate to allege a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment, particularly for failure of an essential service (heat)."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges notice to Defendant, attempted but inadequate repairs, continuing intermittent heating failures, and that the alleged harms (higher electric bills, illness, missed work) flowed from those heating failures\u2014facts sufficient at the pleading stage to allege causal and proximate connection between the landlord\u2019s conduct/omission and the interference/damages."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint quantifies economic harms (approx. $150/month increased electric bills for space-heater use, out\u2011of\u2011pocket medical expenses, lost wages) and estimates total damages of $600, properly alleging compensable economic and non\u2011economic harms arising from the alleged breach."
