COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jessica Freeman ("Plaintiff"), by her undersigned attorney (or pro se, as indicated below), alleges the following against defendant Tom Holland ("Defendant"):

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is an individual and resident of Newton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Tom Holland is an adult individual who resides in Newton, Massachusetts and at all times relevant to this Complaint owned, kept, controlled, or was responsible for the behavior of a large dog that Defendant permitted to be off-leash in Oak Hill Park.

3. On July 15, 2023, the incident described below occurred at Oak Hill Park, 123 Oak Street, Newton, Massachusetts.

4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because he resides in and/or performs acts in Massachusetts and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in Newton District Court under the District Court rules because the incident occurred in Newton and the amount claimed is within this Court’s jurisdictional limits.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On July 15, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a designated walking/jogging path at Oak Hill Park, located at 123 Oak Street, Newton, Massachusetts.

7. Oak Hill Park posts and maintains signage informing park users that dogs must be on a leash.

8. Defendant is a park regular who has owned and exercised a large dog at Oak Hill Park. Despite the posted leash requirement, Defendant has frequently allowed his dog to run off-leash in the park.

9. On the date in question, Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away from the jogging path, talking with friends. Defendant had a leash draped over his shoulder but it was not attached to or controlling the dog.

10. The dog suddenly charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and aggressively. Several other joggers witnessed the dog rush toward Plaintiff and Defendant standing with a leash over his shoulder instead of controlling the dog.

11. Fearing that the dog would bite, attack, or otherwise physically harm her, Plaintiff swerved off the paved jogging path attempting to avoid being bitten or knocked down by the dog.

12. While swerving off the path to avoid the dog, Plaintiff tripped over an exposed tree root and fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path. Plaintiff’s fall resulted in a fractured wrist.

13. The dog never made physical contact with Plaintiff; it stopped when Plaintiff fell and Defendant then called the dog back.

14. Plaintiff was assisted by bystanders and taken to the emergency room for evaluation and treatment. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a fractured wrist. Plaintiff required a wrist brace and follow-up medical treatment, and lost time from work and from pre-paid and prepared-for personal commitments (including a piano recital).

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence as set forth below, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of others using the park, including Plaintiff. This duty included maintaining control of his animal, complying with park rules and posted leash requirements, and otherwise acting reasonably to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to foreseeable park users.

18. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things: (a) knowingly allowing his large dog to run off-leash in a park with posted leash requirements; (b) failing to leash, restrain, or control the dog despite the dog’s proximate presence to other park users; (c) failing to call or otherwise control the dog when it charged toward Plaintiff; (d) negligently supervising the dog while talking with friends and leaving the leash unattached; and (e) otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would under the circumstances.

19. Defendant’s conduct was negligent and/or negligent per se, in that Defendant violated the park’s leash rules and failed to exercise common care under the circumstances. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, in that Plaintiff’s reasonable fear of imminent attack and the need to escape the dog caused Plaintiff to swerve off the path, trip over a tree root, and suffer a fractured wrist.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained and continues to sustain damages, including but not limited to: (a) medical expenses estimated at approximately $2,500; (b) lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200; (c) physical pain and suffering; (d) emotional distress and inconvenience; and (e) loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of daily activities, including inability to perform for and attend a piano recital for which she had prepared.

21. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the amount of damages as further medical records, bills, wage records, and expert opinions become available.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $10,000, including, without limitation, reimbursement for medical expenses (approximately $2,500), lost wages (approximately $1,200), and damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. For costs of suit and such pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies on the general common-law principles of negligence as recognized in Massachusetts and the controlling statutory limitations and animal-control provisions. Relevant authorities include, without limitation: Massachusetts statute of limitations for tort actions (M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A), Massachusetts statutes and provisions regulating animals and dogs contained in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 140 (see, e.g., provisions governing dogs and owner responsibility), and governing case law on negligence and duty in Massachusetts. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283A, 323, 324A (duty and negligence principles); and Massachusetts decisions addressing duty, breach, proximate cause, and damages in negligence cases (see, e.g., decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressing premises and animal-owner liability and the standard of care owed to foreseeable invitees and park users). Plaintiff will rely on and cite additional specific cases and statutes in support of liability and damages in pretrial briefs and at trial.

(If the Court requests a specific authority list in the complaint, Plaintiff will provide citations to controlling Massachusetts cases and statutes in a memorandum of law; in the interest of judicial economy, the Complaint pleads the elements of negligence and provides the statutory and common-law bases for relief.)

Notes and practical suggestions (non-substantive):
- The statutory and case citations in the body of the complaint identify the legal bases for Plaintiff’s negligence claim. Plaintiff should, as soon as practicable, attach or be ready to provide medical records, bills, wage statements, and the names of eyewitnesses (several joggers observed the event) to support the factual allegations and damages claims.
- If Plaintiff wishes, she may ask the Court for a waiver of filing fees or assistance in locating counsel; many district courts have self-help centers and can provide filing guidance.
- The Plaintiff should preserve any photographs, clothing, or other physical evidence and obtain contact information for the witnesses who saw the dog charge and Plaintiff fall.
