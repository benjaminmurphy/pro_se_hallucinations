Hilder explicitly adopts an implied warranty of habitability in all residential leases, makes the landlord\u2019s duty to provide safe, clean, and fit premises an interdependent obligation with the tenant\u2019s duty to pay rent, and applies that doctrine to serious conditions such as sewage, inoperable plumbing, and unsafe ceilings. The court affirms substantial tenant remedies based on the landlord\u2019s failure to correct these serious defects, directly supporting the cited proposition.",
