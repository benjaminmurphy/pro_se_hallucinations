    "existing_custody_order": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges a specific prior custody/parenting order entered May 15, 2017 establishing the child's primary residence with Respondent and states a certified copy of the 2017 Order will be filed/attached; jurisdiction/venue paragraphs also reference the prior order."
    },
    "specific_modification_sought": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint requests increased parenting time/overnights and proposes concrete examples (e.g., two weeknights overnight plus alternating extended weekends), adjustment of school-day/school-year schedules, and other specific relief (transportation, holiday allocation), which sufficiently identifies the modification sought."
    },
    "material_substantial_change": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint pleads multiple specific factual changes since 2017 that bear on the child's welfare: petitioner completed graduate school, obtained stable full\u2011time daytime employment with predictable leave, moved to a two\u2011bedroom apartment providing the child a private bedroom, the child is older and has closer relationship with petitioner, a therapist has recommended increased overnight time, and respondent's conduct has caused the child emotional stress\u2014facts that, if proven, constitute a material and substantial change affecting the child."
    },
    "best_interests_of_child": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges facts showing the requested modification serves the child's health, safety, and welfare: petitioner's stable work schedule and housing enable routine care and school support; the child's therapist recommends more time with petitioner; the child has expressed a clear preference; and the current schedule causes the child distress\u2014allegations directly tied to best\u2011interests considerations."
