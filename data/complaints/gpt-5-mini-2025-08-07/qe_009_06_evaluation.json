Hilder v. St. Peter is a Vermont Supreme Court decision adopting an implied warranty of habitability and describing associated contract remedies; it cites Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway (a Massachusetts case) for the contract\u2011based view of leases, but does not itself articulate or endorse the specific constructive\u2011interference rule described in the proposition. Thus, this opinion does not directly support the claimed proposition, even though it relies on some similar modern landlord\u2011tenant principles.",

These promises constitute interdependent and mutual considerations. Thus, the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent is predicated on the landlord\u2019s obligation to deliver and maintain the premises in habitable condition. Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 198, 293 N.E.2d 831, 842 (1973).\u201d"
