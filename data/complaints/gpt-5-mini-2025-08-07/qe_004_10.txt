COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Jordan Miller brings this action against Defendant Harold Finch for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment with respect to Plaintiff’s tenancy at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604. Plaintiff seeks damages for loss of use and enjoyment and out‑of‑pocket losses caused by repeated rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to take reasonable remedial measures despite notice.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff Jordan Miller is an individual and a tenant residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1433@gmail.com.

3. Defendant Harold Finch is the landlord and owner (or authorized manager) of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604 and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

4. The tenancy began on August 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,300.00.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the premises are located in Worcester County and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA since August 1, 2022 pursuant to a residential tenancy with Defendant.

7. Beginning approximately three months prior to the date of this Complaint (around September 2025), Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in the kitchen on a recurring basis.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent problem and requested that Defendant take adequate measures to eliminate the infestation and prevent reoccurrence.

9. Defendant responded by placing a few snap traps in the apartment and arranging for a single visit by an exterminator.

10. The single exterminator visit did not eliminate the ongoing problem. Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings in the kitchen on a weekly basis.

11. The exterminator who visited the building advised that the infestation appeared to require more comprehensive and repeated treatment and building‑wide remediation to abate the problem. Defendant refused to arrange comprehensive treatment, stating that (a) mouse droppings are “normal for older buildings,” and (b) comprehensive treatment would be “overkill” and too expensive.

12. Defendant also stated (to Plaintiff) that the problem was Plaintiff’s fault and that Plaintiff needed to keep the kitchen cleaner, despite Plaintiff keeping the kitchen in a clean and sanitary condition.

13. As a direct result of the ongoing rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to take reasonable remedial action after notice, Plaintiff has suffered tangible losses, including (a) discarded food items (boxed or bagged items that could not be secured) with an estimated replacement cost of approximately $200.00, and (b) the cost of purchasing sealed plastic food storage containers to protect food from contamination, approximately $80.00.

14. The total of these out‑of‑pocket losses is approximately $280.00.

15. In addition to out‑of‑pocket losses, Plaintiff has suffered loss of the use and enjoyment of the rented premises, including anxiety and inability to use the kitchen in the normal manner for preparing and consuming food, and loss of the quiet enjoyment of the premises.

16. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant take effective remedial measures, including arranging for a comprehensive extermination and reasonable follow‑up treatments and building repairs to prevent rodent ingress. Defendant has refused or failed to take such reasonable measures.

17. Defendant’s refusal or failure to remedy the infestation after notice constitutes an unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law, Massachusetts)

18. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 above as though fully set forth herein.

19. Under Massachusetts common law, a landlord owes tenants the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that tenants may occupy and use the leased premises without substantial interference from the landlord or from conditions that the landlord has a duty to remedy. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the landlord’s duty to provide habitable premises and describing covenant of quiet enjoyment and remedies); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 16.1, 18.1 (summarizing landlord obligations and tenant remedies for substantial interference).

20. Massachusetts and other authorities recognize that substantial interference with habitability, including pest infestation that materially interferes with the tenant’s use of the premises, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment for which the landlord is liable if the landlord fails to take reasonable remedial measures after notice. See, e.g., Javins, supra; Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (pest infestation and landlord obligations); see also Park West Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979) (discussing landlord’s duty regarding conditions that affect habitability and tenant use).

21. In addition, Massachusetts law requires that residential premises meet minimum standards of habitability under the State Sanitary Code. See 105 CMR 410.000: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation (State Sanitary Code) (providing standards addressing vermin and pest control and landlord responsibilities to maintain sanitary conditions); see also M.G.L. c.111 (public health statutes empowering local boards of health to enforce sanitary conditions), and related statutory provisions that form the basis for landlord obligations to maintain habitable premises.

22. Where a landlord, after notice, refuses or fails to take reasonable measures to abate a condition that substantially and unreasonably interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises (including persistent rodent infestation), such failure constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and gives rise to a claim for damages. See Javins, supra; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 16.1, 18.1; authorities cited infra.

23. Defendant’s failure, after notice, to arrange for reasonable and effective extermination and remediation of the persistent rodent infestation at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, and Defendant’s insistence that the condition is “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff must tolerate the condition, constitute an unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual monetary damages in the amount of approximately $280.00 (for lost food and purchase of containers), and has suffered non‑pecuniary damages in the form of loss of quiet enjoyment, loss of the full use of the kitchen, anxiety, inconvenience, and distress.

25. Plaintiff has incurred no attorney’s fees to date (Plaintiff seeks to represent himself pro se), but may seek costs and permissible recovery under applicable law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including:
   1. Actual out‑of‑pocket damages in the amount of $280.00 (or such other amount as the Court finds proven at trial);
   2. General damages for loss of quiet enjoyment, inconvenience, anxiety, and emotional distress in an amount to be proven at trial;

B. Award pre‑ and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award costs of suit and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including an order directing Defendant to take reasonable remedial measures to abate the ongoing infestation (including comprehensive extermination and follow‑up treatments and reasonable building repairs to prevent re‑infestation), if the Court deems injunctive relief appropriate in the circumstances;

D. Grant such other relief as the Court deems fair and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues triable of right by jury.

DATED: December 1, 2025
