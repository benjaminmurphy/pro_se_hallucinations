Michael Johnson
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff: Emily Johnson (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Mother”), pro se. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant: Michael Johnson (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Father”).
1.3. Minor child: Sophia Johnson, born in 2015, currently age 10.
1.4. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws governing custody, parenting time, and modification of prior orders because the parties and the minor child reside (or the original order was entered) in this county and because the Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time matters following the Court’s entry of the original order on May 15, 2016.

2. Nature of Action
2.1. This is an action by the Plaintiff to modify the existing custody/parenting-time order dated May 15, 2016, pursuant to the statutory authority and judicial standards for modification of custody and parenting-time arrangements, on the ground that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and that modification is in the best interests of the minor child.

3. Background Facts
3.1. On May 15, 2016, the Probate and Family Court entered a custody and parenting-time order regarding the parties’ daughter, Sophia Johnson. That order granted primary physical residence to the Father and provided the Mother with limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner visit.
3.2. At the time the 2016 order was entered, the Plaintiff was a graduate student, living in a small studio apartment, and had an inflexible schedule that limited her ability to provide more extensive parenting time and overnight care.
3.3. Since 2016, circumstances have materially changed. Plaintiff has completed her graduate degree, obtained stable full-time employment with normal business hours, and now lives in a two-bedroom apartment where the child has a dedicated bedroom. Plaintiff’s housing, work schedule, and general stability have materially improved compared to 2016.
3.4. The parties’ daughter is now ten years old. Over the past several years she and the Plaintiff have grown very close. The child has expressed to her therapist and, through the therapist, to the Plaintiff, that she feels guilty having to leave Plaintiff’s home after short visits and that she wishes to have more time and additional overnight parenting time with the Plaintiff. The child has written a letter expressing her preference to the Court asking for additional overnights with Mother. The child’s therapist has provided a professional communication confirming the child’s expressed wishes and noting the child’s sense of stress and guilt when visits end.
3.5. The Defendant has refused to discuss any changes to the custody or parenting-time schedule and becomes angry when the child raises the subject. Plaintiff alleges that the Father’s refusal to negotiate and the child’s resulting stress are additional factors supporting modification.
3.6. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the current parenting-time/custody arrangement to reflect the material change in circumstances and to serve the best interests of the child by providing increased parenting time, including additional overnight time, with the Plaintiff.

4. Legal Standard
4.1. Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting-time orders may be modified where there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and where the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and ch. 209 (statutory authority for jurisdiction over custody, parenting time, and modification); see also applicable caselaw recognizing that a modification requires proof of a material change and a best-interest determination (see cases cited below).
4.2. The Plaintiff alleges that the changes in her housing, employment, stability, and the child’s expressed preference and emotional difficulties constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification under Massachusetts law and court precedent. The requested modification will serve the child’s best interests by increasing the meaningful, stable time she spends with the Plaintiff and by reducing the child’s reported guilt and stress.

5. Specific Allegations Supporting Modification
5.1. Housing: At the time of the 2016 order, the Plaintiff lived in a small studio. Plaintiff now lives in a two-bedroom apartment with a room available for the child, which amply accommodates overnight parenting time.
5.2. Employment and Availability: Plaintiff has completed graduate school and is currently employed in a stable full-time position with regular business hours that permit consistent evenings and weekend parenting time and overnight care.
5.3. Parent-Child Relationship: The Plaintiff and the child have developed a close, loving relationship since the 2016 order; increased time with the Plaintiff is likely to strengthen the child’s emotional and psychological wellbeing.
5.4. Child’s Wishes and Therapist’s Observations: The child has directly expressed a desire for more overnights with the Plaintiff and has written a letter to the Court to that effect. The child’s treating therapist has communicated that the child experiences guilt and distress about leaving the Plaintiff after short visits and has recommended greater stability and additional parenting time with the Plaintiff. These communications and professional observations are relevant to the best-interest determination.
5.5. Failure to Cooperate: Defendant’s refusal to discuss changes, and his anger when the child raises the issue, impede co-parenting and are contrary to the child’s interest in healthy parental relationships. This factor supports judicial intervention to adjust the parenting-time schedule.

6. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order modifying the May 15, 2016 custody/parenting-time order as follows:
6.1. Find that a material change of circumstances has occurred since May 15, 2016 and that modification is warranted pursuant to Massachusetts statutory and case law;
6.2. Modify the parenting-time/custody order to provide Plaintiff with substantially increased parenting time, including additional overnight parenting time. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter a parenting plan that provides, at a minimum:
    a. Regular weekday overnight parenting time with Mother of at least one weeknight per week, and
    b. Increased weekend parenting time so that the Mother has parenting time every other weekend or an equivalent schedule providing substantially increased overnights, and
    c. Reasonable holiday and vacation allocation to reflect the increased time with Mother, and
    d. Any other orders necessary to effectuate the modified parenting-time schedule (including transportation, notice, and communication protocols).
6.3. Alternatively, if the Court deems it appropriate after hearing, the Plaintiff requests award of joint physical custody with a parenting schedule that more equitably apportions overnights between the parents consistent with the child’s best interests.
6.4. Order that the Court receive and consider the child’s written statement and the therapist’s written statement as proffered exhibits and order any further evaluation (psychological evaluation, guardian ad litem, or parenting coordinator) only if the Court deems such evaluation necessary to resolve disputed issues.
6.5. Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs and reasonable fees to the extent permitted by law.

7. Attached Exhibits (to be filed with this Complaint)
7.1. Exhibit A: Copy of the current custody/parenting-time order entered May 15, 2016.
7.2. Exhibit B: Plaintiff’s proposed parenting plan/schedule.
7.3. Exhibit C: Letter from the child to the Court (submitted under seal or as the Court directs).
7.4. Exhibit D: Communication from child’s therapist regarding the child’s expressed feelings and recommendation for stability and increased time with Mother.
7.5. Exhibit E: Proof of Plaintiff’s current housing (lease) and employment verification (paystub or employment letter), demonstrating changed circumstances.

8. Request for Hearing and Service
8.1. Plaintiff requests a hearing on this Complaint in accordance with the Probate and Family Court procedures and rules.
8.2. Plaintiff will effect service of this Complaint and all supporting papers on the Defendant in accordance with the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court rules.

- Massachusetts courts’ decisions recognizing the material-change-and-best-interests standard for modification of custody orders and the need to weigh multiple factors in determining whether modification is in a child’s best interest (see, e.g., leading Massachusetts decisions interpreting the statutory standard, and appellate authority addressing parenting-time modifications and the weight to be given a child’s expressed preferences);
- Appellate decisions addressing the role of changed circumstances (including parental rehabilitation, housing, employment, and child preference) in modification proceedings (see, e.g., Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing custody modification standards and factors);
- Authority recognizing that a trial court may consider a minor child’s expressed preferences and a mental-health professional’s observations in determining best interests;
- Authority addressing the Court’s equitable powers to adjust parenting-time schedules to serve the child’s best interests and to order evaluations or appoint guardians ad litem when appropriate.
