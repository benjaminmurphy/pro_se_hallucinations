Cardozo explicitly frames negligence and duty as relational, defined by the \u201crange of reasonable apprehension,\u201d and holds there is no liability where the harm to the plaintiff was not reasonably foreseeable. That aligns with the proposition that Palsgraf is a foundational case on proximate cause and foreseeability and routinely cited as persuasive negligence authority.",
