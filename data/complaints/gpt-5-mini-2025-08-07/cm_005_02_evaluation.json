Granville addresses constitutional limits on state interference with the fundamental rights of fit parents, specifically criticizing a statute that allowed courts to override parental decisions based solely on a judge\u2019s best-interests determination. It does not involve, interpret, or apply statutes governing modification of custody orders, nor does it endorse the generic use of a best interests standard in that context. Instead, it constrains how a best interests standard may be applied against fit parents, so it does not affirm the proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Thus, in practical effect, in the State of Washington a court can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge's determination of the child's best interests.... As we have explained, the Due Process Clause does not permit a State to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a 'better' decision could be made.\" (530 U.S. at 67, 73)"

It does not deal with family-law custody orders, modification of custody, or articulate or apply a generic \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 custody standard. Citing Parham as statutory or precedential authority on modification of custody orders and the best interests standard mischaracterizes its subject matter and holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is 'the mere creature of the State' and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally 'have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children] for additional obligations.'
