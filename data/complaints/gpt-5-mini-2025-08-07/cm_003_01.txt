Michael Carter
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Venue
1.1. Plaintiff: Emily Carter, of legal age, currently residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant: Michael Carter, of legal age, residence in Middlesex County, Massachusetts (address on file with the Court).
1.3. Child: Jacob Carter, born in 2017 (age 8), subject of the existing custody order.
1.4. Venue: This Court has jurisdiction and venue over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law because the parties and the child reside in Middlesex County and because the underlying custody order was entered in this Court. The current custody order was entered on May 10, 2021, in Middlesex Probate and Family Court.

2. Relief Requested
2.1. Plaintiff hereby petitions this Court, pursuant to applicable Massachusetts statutes and caselaw governing custody modification, to modify the existing custody and parenting-time order entered on May 10, 2021. Specifically, Plaintiff requests:
  a. A temporary emergency modification, effective immediately, to suspend unsupervised overnight parenting time between Defendant and the child pending an expedited fact-finding hearing; and
  b. A permanent modification of the parenting-time plan to require supervised overnights with Defendant or other conditions determined necessary to protect the child’s health and safety (e.g., supervised visitation by a qualified third-party agency, random or reasonable suspicion substance testing of Defendant prior to overnights, completion of a substance-abuse evaluation and any recommended treatment, participation in parenting classes, and any other conditions the Court deems in Jacob’s best interests); and
  c. Appointment of a guardian ad litem or other Court-appointed investigator as appropriate to represent the child’s interests and to assist the Court in fact-finding; and
  d. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper, including attorney’s fees and costs if appropriate.

3. Background and Existing Order
3.1. On May 10, 2021, this Court entered an order awarding the parties shared legal custody of their child, Jacob, with primary physical residence with Plaintiff and weekend parenting time for Defendant, including periodic overnight visits, as memorialized in the Court’s 2021 order.
3.2. At the time of entry of the 2021 order, the Court found that both parents were able to co-parent and that shared legal custody was in the child’s best interests.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
4.1. Since entry of the 2021 order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s health, safety, and welfare warranting modification of the custody and parenting-time arrangement.
4.2. Specific facts constituting a material change in circumstances:
  a. The child has disclosed to Plaintiff on multiple occasions that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that Defendant “can’t walk straight” sometimes, which the child has described as frightening and concerning.
  b. A neighbor who is aware of the family situation provided Plaintiff with a video showing Defendant stumbling while removing the child from a vehicle late at night; the video suggests Defendant was intoxicated or otherwise impaired at the time the child was in Defendant’s care.
  c. The child’s school has reported that Jacob appears exhausted and fatigued every Monday morning, causing school personnel to express concern about the child’s welfare and to inquire about nighttime conditions over the weekend.
  d. Plaintiff believes these facts indicate impaired parenting capacity by Defendant that places the child at risk of harm during overnight parenting time, and that the risk is ongoing.
4.3. These developments were not known to the Court at the time of the 2021 order and materially affect the child’s welfare, requiring immediate Court intervention to protect the child pending a full evidentiary hearing.

5. Legal Standard
5.1. Under Massachusetts law, a prior custody order may be modified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare since entry of the prior order and when modification is in the child’s best interests (see, e.g., G. L. c. 208 and the body of Massachusetts custody jurisprudence recognizing the “material change” standard). The Court makes custody and parenting-time determinations based upon the best interests of the child, considering all relevant factors that affect the child’s welfare.
5.2. Plaintiff asserts that the statutory and doctrinal standards for modification are met here because the post-2021 evidence indicates a risk to Jacob’s safety and wellbeing during Defendant’s unsupervised overnight parenting time, and that a modification requiring supervision or other protective conditions is necessary and in Jacob’s best interests.

6. Temporary Relief Requested
6.1. Plaintiff seeks temporary emergency relief suspending Defendant’s unsupervised overnight parenting time immediately and scheduling an expedited hearing so the Court may determine whether continued unsupervised overnight parenting time would place Jacob at risk of harm.
6.2. Plaintiff also requests that the Court order reasonable interim measures, which may include (but are not limited to):
  a. Supervised parenting time for Defendant pending the hearing;
  b. An order directing Defendant to submit to a substance-use evaluation and to abstain from alcohol or illicit substances while parenting the child; and
  c. Appointment of a guardian ad litem and/or a Court investigator to interview the child, parents, providers, and relevant witnesses and to report to the Court.

7. Authority
7.1. Plaintiff relies on the statutory and case law principles governing custody modification and the best interests standard under Massachusetts law, including statutes and cases that govern jurisdiction, modification, appointment of guardians ad litem, and temporary emergency relief in custody matters. Representative statutory and judicial authorities include, without limitation:
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (governing divorce and family matters, custody determinations and modifications);
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (abuse prevention, for protection orders where domestic violence or child endangerment may be implicated);
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (juvenile matters, child welfare, and mandated reporting obligations);
  - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 (appointment of guardians ad litem and procedures for certain family proceedings);
  - Massachusetts cases recognizing and applying the “material change in circumstances” standard for modification of custody and parenting time and applying the best-interests-of-the-child analysis in modification proceedings (see, e.g., decisions interpreting custody modification standards and authorizing interim/emergency relief where a child’s safety is implicated).
7.2. Plaintiff will rely on further statutes, rules, and caselaw at hearing and trial to support modification, including authorities addressing parental impairment, substance abuse, the appointment of guardians ad litem, and the Court’s authority to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time in the child’s best interests.

8. Facts Supporting Findings of Imminent Risk
8.1. The facts described in Paragraph 4 above demonstrate a prima facie showing that the child may be at imminent risk of harm during Defendant’s unsupervised overnight parenting time, warranting immediate temporary relief.
8.2. Plaintiff is prepared to present evidence including the child’s statements, the neighbor’s video, school communications, and other relevant evidence at an expedited hearing.

9. Request for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
  a. Schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and grant temporary emergency relief immediately suspending Defendant’s unsupervised overnight parenting time pending said hearing;
  b. Modify the existing custody order, after hearing, to require that Defendant’s parenting time be supervised or conditioned (including supervised overnights or other protective measures) unless and until Defendant completes and complies with recommended substance-abuse evaluation/treatment and other Court-ordered conditions shown to protect the child’s welfare;
  c. Appoint a guardian ad litem or Court investigator to represent and advocate for Jacob’s best interests and to assist the Court in fact-finding;
  d. Order Defendant to undergo appropriate evaluations (including substance-use assessment) and to provide releases for relevant medical and treatment records to the Court and the guardian ad litem;
  e. Award such other temporary and permanent relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Jacob, including costs and attorney’s fees if warranted; and
  f. Grant any further relief deemed appropriate to protect the child’s best interests.

10. Certification and Prayer
10.1. Plaintiff certifies that she will serve this Complaint and summons upon Defendant in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and Probate and Family Court rules.
10.2. Plaintiff requests that this Complaint be entered and set for hearing on an expedited basis due to the immediacy of the child-safety concerns described herein.

Respectfully submitted,
