    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads that Plaintiff is a tenant at 45 Broadway St, pays $1,500/month in rent, and that Defendant is the owner/landlord of the building (\u00b6\u00b61\u20134). These facts sufficiently establish a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges repeated omissions by Defendant: a broken building entry latch/lock for at least two months, Plaintiff\u2019s notifications, Defendant\u2019s acknowledgment but failure to repair, and repeated reminders without corrective action (\u00b6\u00b66\u20138, 12, 16). These allegations sufficiently plead an act/omission by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges unauthorized persons entered the building, mail and a package worth ~$120 were stolen, evidence of someone sleeping in the basement, Plaintiff\u2019s reasonable fear for safety, and loss of full use/enjoyment of the premises (\u00b6\u00b69\u201311, 13, 17). These facts, showing intrusion, theft, and safety fears, adequately allege a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint links Defendant\u2019s failure to repair/secure the common entry after notice to the unauthorized entries, thefts, and the tenant\u2019s fear/expense\u2014alleging the landlord\u2019s omission permitted foreseeable intrusions (\u00b6\u00b66\u20139, 11, 16\u201317). These allegations sufficiently plead causation between the landlord\u2019s conduct and the interference."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads specific compensable losses (stolen package \u2248 $120; out\u2011of\u2011pocket security expenditures \u2248 $200) and additional emotional harm and loss of use (\u00b6\u00b611, 18\u201319). These allegations adequately plead damages for the cause of action."
