The majority grounds liability in a duty of reasonable care and an implied contractual obligation to maintain a level of security, and speaks of damages in negligence, not quiet-enjoyment-based remedies. Thus, it does not establish that failure to repair materially interfering conditions after notice constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or supports equitable relief on that theory.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cUpon consideration of all pertinent factors, we find that there is a duty of protection owed by the landlord to the tenant in an urban multiple unit apartment dwelling.\u2026\n\nSecondly, on the rationale of this court in Levine v. Katz, Kendall v. Gore Properties, and Javins v. First National Realty Corporation, supra, there is implied in the contract between landlord and tenant an obligation on the landlord to provide those protective measures which are within his reasonable capacity.\u2026 The appellant tenant was entitled to performance by the landlord measured by this standard of protection whether the landlord\u2019s obligation be viewed as grounded in contract or in tort.\u201d"
