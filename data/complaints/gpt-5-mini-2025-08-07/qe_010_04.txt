PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Moore ("Plaintiff") is an individual and a resident of Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

2. Defendant Karen Thompson ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the residential premises at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852 and may be served at that address.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy for the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852 beginning on June 1, 2021. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00.

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the Lowell District Court.

5. Venue is proper in Lowell District Court because the premises and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

7. Beginning in or about mid-to-late 2024 and continuing into 2025, Plaintiff discovered mold growth in the bathroom of the apartment, initially in the corner of the shower and later spreading to the bathroom ceiling.

8. The bathroom in Plaintiff’s unit does not have an operable window; the only ventilation is a mechanical exhaust fan located over or near the shower.

9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the mold as soon as Plaintiff discovered it. Defendant inspected the bathroom in response to Plaintiff’s report.

10. During or after that inspection, Defendant told Plaintiff that the mold was caused by Plaintiff’s showering habits — specifically that Plaintiff allegedly failed to run the exhaust fan consistently and took showers that were “too hot and too long.”

11. Plaintiff does run the exhaust fan when she showers but acknowledges she may not have used it every single time. Plaintiff reasonably believed the installed ventilation was adequate for normal residential use.

12. Defendant offered to clean the visible mold but refused to address or correct the apartment’s ventilation (for example, by repairing, replacing or improving the fan or otherwise providing adequate ventilation), and refused to remediate conditions that produced ongoing mold growth on the basis that Plaintiff “caused” the problem.

13. Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced new and worsening respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing. These symptoms are new for Plaintiff and were not present prior to the mold.

14. Plaintiff consulted a medical provider who concluded that Plaintiff’s respiratory problems are likely related to mold exposure and advised Plaintiff that remediation of the mold was needed for health reasons.

15. As a result of the mold problem, Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket losses of approximately $60.00 for replacement of a moldy shower curtain and towels. Plaintiff also suffered loss of quiet use and enjoyment of the premises and related economic and non-economic harms, and estimates total damages of approximately $250.00 arising from Defendant’s conduct (including diminution of use and damaged personal property).

16. Defendant’s actions and omissions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s possession and use of the leased premises and have deprived Plaintiff of the beneficial use of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law; Massachusetts)

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

18. Under Massachusetts law and common-law landlord-tenant principles, a landlord owes to a residential tenant the covenant of quiet enjoyment — an implied promise that the tenant will have possession and use of the leased premises free from substantial interference by the landlord or by conditions the landlord has a duty to correct. See generally Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing landlord obligations relating to habitability and tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1 (summary of implied covenants).

19. Massachusetts statutes and regulations impose minimum standards for fitness for human habitation and public-health-based obligations that bear on a landlord’s responsibility for conditions that affect habitability and the safety and health of tenants — including the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), and Massachusetts public-health statutes concerning nuisances and sanitary conditions. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (general landlord-tenant provisions).

20. A landlord who fails to maintain premises in a habitable condition and who fails to remedy conditions that substantially impair a tenant’s use and enjoyment may be liable to the tenant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and for related damages. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (discussing habitability and tenant remedies); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and landlord responsibilities); Edwards v. Habib, 397 A.2d 1049 (D.C. 1979).

21. Defendant had actual notice of the mold condition and of the need for remediation as a matter of health and habitability and failed to take reasonable steps to correct the hazardous and substantially interfering condition — refusing to address ventilation and limiting remediative efforts to surface cleaning while attributing the problem solely to Plaintiff’s conduct.

22. Defendant’s failure to remediate the mold and to correct inadequate ventilation has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, has created an unsafe and unhealthy living environment, and has caused Plaintiff to suffer physical symptoms, personal-property losses, inconvenience, and other damages.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease and is liable to Plaintiff for damages proximately caused by that breach.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. A finding that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy;

B. Compensatory damages in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), or such other amount as the Court finds appropriate to compensate Plaintiff for loss of use, personal-property loss, medical-related aggravation, and other damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach;

C. An order directing Defendant to undertake, at Defendant’s cost, prompt and adequate remediation of the mold condition and reasonable corrective measures to assure adequate bathroom ventilation (including repair or replacement of the exhaust fan and any other reasonable measures necessary to prevent recurrence), subject to inspection by a qualified neutral expert if the Court deems appropriate;

D. Costs of suit and such other relief as the Court deems proper, including pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

E. Any other relief that the Court deems just and equitable.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITIES (Representative; non-exhaustive)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act) (relevant to landlord practices affecting tenants’ rights; illustrative authority)
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Mass. State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (selected provisions on implied covenants)

- Relevant Massachusetts authorities construing landlord obligations under common law and statute, including SJC and Appeals Court decisions addressing landlord duties and tenant remedies (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; 105 CMR 410.000).

(Notes: The foregoing list includes controlling Massachusetts statutes and regulations and seminal judicial and secondary authorities describing and supporting the well-established legal principles governing landlord obligations regarding habitability, health and quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff relies on these authorities to support the legal theory that Defendant’s failure to remediate mold and to correct inadequate ventilation constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.)
