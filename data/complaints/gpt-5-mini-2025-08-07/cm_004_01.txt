v.                                                   Docket No. ___________

Thomas Bennett
     Defendant/Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/PHYSICAL CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Residence
1.1 Petitioner: Rachel Bennett ("Petitioner" or "Mother"), residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent: Thomas Bennett ("Respondent" or "Father"), residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and rules governing custody, modification of custody, and visitation, because the parties and the child reside in Bristol County and because this action seeks modification of an existing custody order entered by this Court on April 15, 2019.

3. Child(ren) Subject to This Filing
3.1 The custody modification sought concerns the parties’ child:
     - Ethan Bennett, born in 2017 (currently eight (8) years old).

4. Existing Order
4.1 On April 15, 2019, this Court entered an order awarding primary physical custody of Ethan to Petitioner (Mother) and granting Respondent (Father) three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnight visitation.

5. Basis for Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
5.1 Petitioner alleges that since entry of the April 15, 2019 order there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, warranting modification of the existing custody/visitation order.
5.2 Specific changed circumstances include, without limitation:
     a. The child is now eight (8) years old and attends school full time. His developmental needs, school schedule, homework, bedtime routines, and social/extra-curricular activities have evolved since the 2019 order was entered when the child was three (3) years old.
     b. The parties and the child have expressed a desire that parenting time be adjusted to fit the child's age and school routine. The child has repeatedly asked for actual sleepovers/overnights with his Father.
     c. Respondent now has a separate apartment in which the child has his own bedroom and adequate space and sleeping arrangements. This materially changes the facts relied on by the Court in 2019 when it denied overnight visitation because Respondent previously lacked adequate housing and privacy.
     d. Under the current short-visit schedule Father’s three short weekday visits and a Sunday afternoon visit require frequent pick-ups and drop-offs on school nights, which has resulted in excessive shuttling of the child, disruption of homework and bedtime routines, and physical and emotional fatigue for the child and both parents.
     e. Both parents agree that the current schedule is no longer appropriate and that a modified schedule, including overnight/regular sleepover parenting time and a reduction in school-night shuttling, would better serve the child’s needs.
5.3 These changes are material, substantial, and unforeseen at the time of the 2019 order and affect the child’s best interests.

6. Best Interests of the Child
6.1 Petitioner alleges that modifying the existing custody/visitation order to allow appropriate overnight parenting time with Respondent and to restructure weekday visits to reduce school-night disruption is in the best interests of the child.
6.2 In determining custody and visitation, the Court must consider the child’s safety, health, needs and welfare, the child’s developmental stage, the parents’ abilities to meet the child’s needs, the child’s relationship with each parent, and the continuity and stability of the child’s routines and schooling. The requested modification would promote continuity of care, reduce disruption to the child’s sleep and homework routines, and foster a healthy parent-child relationship with Respondent in his now-adequate living environment.
6.3 The parties’ mutual agreement that the schedule should be adjusted is an additional factor supporting modification to a schedule that includes overnights appropriate for the child’s age while preserving the child’s stability and schooling.

7. Legal Basis for Relief Requested
7.1 Petitioner brings this Complaint pursuant to the Court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody matters and the legal standard permitting modification of custody and visitation orders upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and in the child’s best interests.
7.2 Petitioner requests that the Court apply the governing statutory and caselaw standards for modification of custody and visitation to the facts set forth herein and enter an appropriate order modifying physical custody/visitation consistent with the child’s best interests.

8. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
8.1 Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the April 15, 2019 custody/visitation order sufficient to warrant modification of the order;
8.2 Modify the existing custody/visitation order to provide for a parenting time schedule that includes:
     a. Appropriate overnight/overnight sleepover parenting time for Respondent (Father) consistent with the child’s age and school schedule (for example: phased overnights culminating in regular weekend overnight time and selected weeknight overnights as the Court deems appropriate); and
     b. Adjusted weekday parenting time designed to minimize pick-ups and drop-offs on school nights and to preserve the child’s homework and bedtime routines;
8.3 Make such other orders as the Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect the best interests, safety, and welfare of the child, including any provisions for exchange logistics, temporary modification pending final hearing if warranted, and any further supervision or conditions the Court deems necessary;
8.4 Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

9. Request for Hearing
9.1 Petitioner requests that the Court schedule a hearing on this Complaint for Modification and that notice of the time and place of hearing be provided to Respondent in accordance with the Probate and Family Court Rules.

10. Verification and Signature
10.1 I, Rachel Bennett, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (General)
Note: The following lists the primary statutory framework and caselaw principles governing modification of custody/visitation in Massachusetts. The Petitioner intends to rely on the applicable Massachusetts statutes and controlling caselaw addressing modification of custody upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and the child's best interests at hearing. Counsel or the Court may cite the specific statutory sections and cases most applicable at hearing. The Petitioner intends to rely on and will cite, inter alia, the following categories of authority and relevant authorities construing them:

Statutes and Rules (selected)
- Massachusetts General Laws, chapters and provisions governing custody, guardianship and Probate & Family Court jurisdiction (Mass. Gen. Laws chs. governing family law and custody).
- Massachusetts Probate & Family Court rules and local rules concerning filing for modification of custody/visitation and notice requirements.
- Other Massachusetts statutes relevant to child welfare, parental responsibility, and court authority to modify existing orders.

Representative Massachusetts Caselaw on Custody Modifications and Best Interests
(These are representative categories of precedent addressing material change in circumstances, continuing jurisdiction, and best interests considerations that the Petitioner will rely upon and will cite with particularity at hearing):
- Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions establishing the "material change in circumstances" standard for modification of custody and visitation.
- Decisions addressing the weight to be given to changes in parental housing and fitness, and how new circumstances (such as a parent obtaining adequate housing) can support a modification.
- Decisions interpreting the "best interests of the child" factors (including stability, school routine, child’s developmental stage, and continuity of care).
- Cases addressing phased or graduated increases in overnight visitation and appropriate safeguards and standards.
- Cases addressing the relevance of agreement between parents, and the Court’s responsibility to independently determine what is in the child's best interests.
- Cases on logistics of exchanges, school-night stability, and how frequent shuttling undermines the child’s welfare.
(At hearing the Petitioner will cite specific controlling SJC and Appeals Court decisions and statutory sections most directly applicable to the facts.)
