David Martinez,
    Plaintiff

v.                                                      Docket No. ____________

Lynn Apartment Management, Inc.,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff David Martinez (hereinafter “Plaintiff”) is an individual and resident of Lynn, Massachusetts, residing at 123 Maple St., Unit 3, Lynn, MA 01901. Plaintiff’s contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, Inc. (hereinafter “Defendant”) is a Massachusetts corporation which owns, manages, leases and/or controls the residential apartment building located at 123 Maple St., Lynn, Massachusetts (the “Premises”). Defendant may be served at its principal place of business or at the Premises.
1.3 This action arises out of personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff on or about July 15, 2023 at 123 Maple St., Lynn, MA. Venue is proper in Lynn District Court because the cause of action arose in Lynn and Defendant does business and manages property there.
1.4 The jurisdictional amount is within the limits of the Lynn District Court.

2. Statement of Facts
2.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1.1 through 1.4 as if fully set forth herein.
2.2 At all times material hereto, Defendant owned, managed, controlled and/or had custody and control of the common hallways and common safety devices (including smoke detectors) for the apartment building located at 123 Maple St., Lynn, MA.
2.3 Massachusetts law, building code, and customary landlord obligations impose upon landlords and property managers a duty to provide and to reasonably maintain required fire detection devices, including smoke detectors, in common hallways and in proximity to tenants’ units, and to keep such devices in working order. See M.G.L. c. 148; 780 CMR (Massachusetts Building Code) (see, e.g., requirements for smoke detection and alarm systems); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 343 (duty to maintain safe premises); see also Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (establishing general duty principles); cf. Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause principles applied to duty).
2.4 For months prior to July 15, 2023, the hallway smoke detector immediately outside Plaintiff’s unit intermittently emitted a “chirping” noise indicating a low battery condition. On at least three separate occasions, Plaintiff informed Defendant (by in-person notice, telephone, and/or written notice) that the smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was not functioning properly and was chirping.
2.5 Despite Plaintiff’s repeated notices, Defendant failed to repair, replace, or otherwise ensure continuous operation of the smoke detector. Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff that Defendant would “take care of it” but did not do so.
2.6 At some point prior to July 15, 2023, an unknown person removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector and left the battery on a windowsill in the building common area. Defendant knew or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known that the detector was without a battery and inoperative.
2.7 On or about the night of July 15, 2023, a fire began in a first-floor apartment in the building due to cooking-related ignition in the kitchen of that unit. Because the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was inoperative, no audible alarm warned Plaintiff and other upstairs residents of the developing fire and smoke.
2.8 Plaintiff first became aware of the developing fire when Plaintiff smelled smoke in the hallway and in his apartment. By that time, smoke had already filled the hallway and significantly limited visibility and breathable air.
2.9 As Plaintiff attempted to evacuate the building, Plaintiff experienced acute respiratory distress and difficulty breathing due to smoke inhalation. Plaintiff was transported to and treated at a hospital emergency department and was admitted overnight for treatment of smoke inhalation.
2.10 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain a working smoke detector, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury (smoke inhalation), medical expenses, lost wages, and damage to personal property from smoke and firefighting water.
2.11 Plaintiff’s reasonably incurred medical expenses are approximately $7,000. Plaintiff’s lost wages are approximately $2,500. Plaintiff also suffered damage to personal property; the full extent and amount of property damage will be proven at trial.

3. Negligence (Count I)
3.1 Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.11 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the common areas of the Premises reasonably safe, to maintain safety devices (including smoke detectors) in operating condition, and to take reasonable steps to warn tenants of hazardous conditions. See M.G.L. c. 148; 780 CMR; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land to invitees); Polsby v. Samuelson (see analogous Massachusetts authority recognizing landlord duties; see also general Massachusetts negligence law discussed infra).
3.3 Defendant breached that duty by failing to ensure the hallway smoke detector was functional despite knowing, or having constructive knowledge, that it was intermittently non-functional; by failing to replace or timely repair the device after repeated notice from Plaintiff; and by failing to take reasonable measures to warn tenants or provide alternate means of notification.
3.4 Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. The inoperative smoke detector directly resulted in Plaintiff’s lack of timely notice of the first-floor fire, which caused Plaintiff to be exposed to smoke and to suffer smoke inhalation, medical treatment, lost wages, and property damage. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 281–286 (causation principles); see also Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (proximate cause); Massachusetts cases addressing foreseeability and proximate causation in negligence actions (e.g., cases discussed below).
3.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages including, but not limited to: physical injury and pain and suffering (smoke inhalation and difficulty breathing); medical and hospital expenses of approximately $7,000; lost wages of approximately $2,500; damage to personal property (amount to be proven at trial); and other general and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

4. Demand for Jury Trial
4.1 Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

5. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff David Martinez respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor against Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, Inc. as follows:
A. Awarding compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (medical expenses incurred to date approximately $7,000);
B. Awarding compensatory damages for lost wages in an amount to be proven at trial (lost wages approximately $2,500);
C. Awarding compensatory damages for damage to personal property in an amount to be proven at trial;
D. Awarding general damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be proven at trial;
E. Awarding costs, interest, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
