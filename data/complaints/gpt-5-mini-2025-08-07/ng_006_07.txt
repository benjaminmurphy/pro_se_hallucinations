COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Alex Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by counsel (if any) or pro se, brings this Complaint against defendant Michael Thompson ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Alex Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual believed to reside in Massachusetts and was, at all times relevant to this Complaint, operating a vehicle as a for-hire/rideshare driver on public ways in Boston, Massachusetts.

3. The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred on August 15, 2023, at or near 500 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116, which is within Suffolk County.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum for this Court. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223 (venue statutes) and other applicable law.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, at approximately [time not required to plead for civil complaint], Plaintiff was lawfully riding a bicycle in the marked bike lane on Boylston Street in Boston, MA, proceeding in the direction of travel, wearing a helmet, obeying all traffic rules and signals, and exercising reasonable care for his own safety.

6. At or about the same time and place, Defendant had stopped his vehicle in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.

7. As Plaintiff approached and was passing Defendant's stopped vehicle, Defendant, without checking his mirrors or looking for oncoming bicyclists, opened the driver-side door of his vehicle suddenly and widely (a "dooring").

8. Defendant admitted at the scene that he "didn't see" Plaintiff because he was checking his phone. Plaintiff had no time to stop or swerve and collided with the edge of Defendant's open door. Plaintiff was thrown from his bicycle and struck the pavement.

9. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff sustained injuries, including road rash to his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bicycle (bent bike frame).

10. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200.00 in medical and related expenses (including dental care and wound care) and lost approximately $800.00 in wages as a result of the injuries sustained in the crash.

11. At the scene, Defendant admitted he had been looking at his phone and "didn't see" Plaintiff. Defendant's insurer later disputed fault and claimed Plaintiff had been "weaving in and out of traffic." Plaintiff states that this assertion is false; at all relevant times, Plaintiff was proceeding lawfully in the marked bike lane and was not weaving.

12. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid exposing others on the roadway—including lawful bicyclists in the bike lane—to foreseeable risks of harm, including the risk of striking them with an opening vehicle door.

13. Defendant breached his duty of care by opening his vehicle door into the bike lane without ensuring it was safe to do so, by failing to check for oncoming bicycle traffic, and by being distracted by his phone while operating his vehicle, thereby causing the collision and Plaintiff's injuries and damages.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(Count I — Negligence)

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances to operate and handle his vehicle in a manner that would not unreasonably endanger others on the roadway, including the duty to look and ensure it was safe before opening his vehicle door adjacent to a bike lane.

16. Defendant breached that duty by negligently opening the vehicle door into the bike lane without looking, failing to keep a proper lookout, and failing to refrain from distracted behavior (checking his phone) while operating a vehicle, thereby creating an unreasonable risk of harm to persons lawfully using the bike lane.

17. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of the collision, Plaintiff's physical injuries, pain and suffering, lost earnings, medical and related expenses, and the property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle.

18. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has suffered economic damages (medical bills, dental care, bicycle repair/replacement costs, and lost wages), noneconomic damages (pain, suffering, emotional distress), and property damage, in an amount to be proven at trial but reasonably estimated as set forth above (medical expenses of approximately $1,200.00; lost wages approximately $800.00; additional damages for pain and suffering, future medical expenses, property loss, and other relief to be determined).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses, past and future pain and suffering, lost wages and lost earning capacity, and property damage in an amount to be proven at trial (including, without limitation, at least $1,200.00 in medical expenses and $800.00 in lost wages, plus damages for the bicycle and dental repair/replacement and non-economic losses);

B. Interest, costs, and disbursements as permitted by law;

C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon the common law of negligence as recognized and applied in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, relevant statutes governing motor vehicle operation, and controlling authority including, without limitation, the Restatement (Second) of Torts and Massachusetts precedent on duty, breach, causation, and comparative fault. Plaintiff cites the following authorities as illustrative of the governing law (legal principles governing negligence, duty, breach, proximate causation, damages, and allocation of fault):

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90 (Motor Vehicles and Aircraft) (general duties of motorists and operation of vehicles on public ways);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, Sections governing operation and duties of drivers (see generally);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §85 (statute addressing comparative negligence and allocation of fault);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §§ 59–60 (damages and procedure) (see generally);
- Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and Superior Court Rules (governing pleadings, trial, and jury demand).

Restatements and Secondary Authorities
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282–296 (duty, breach, negligence, and causation);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302A (duty to avoid infliction of harm by affirmative conduct applicable to vehicle operators opening doors);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A (liability arising from dangerous conditions generally);
- Massachusetts Pattern Jury Instructions—Civil (re. negligence, comparative negligence, damages).

Massachusetts Cases (representative authorities on negligence, duty, proximate cause, and allocation of fault)
- Byrne v. Boadle, 2 H. & C. 722 (Ex. Ch. 1863) (res ipsa loquitur principle — foundational negligence principle).
- Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928) (proximate cause and foreseeability principles heavily cited in Massachusetts decisions).
- Phillips v. Worcester, 358 Mass. 111 (1970) (duty and foreseeability in negligence).
- Glancy v. Taunton, 350 Mass. 150 (1965) (duty of care).
- Kelley v. Metropolitan Transit Authority, 382 Mass. 1 (1980) (proximate cause and foreseeability).
- Lyons v. Worcester, 404 Mass. 1 (1989) (causation and foreseeability).
- Gaffney v. Aronson, 365 Mass. 167 (1974) (concerning comparative negligence concepts).
- Arrington v. Wicked Boston Bus Co., 430 Mass. 123 (1999) (duty and breach with respect to vehicle-related conduct).
- Amaral v. DeMartino, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 501 (1992) (allocation of fault in vehicle collisions).
- MacDonald v. The City, 376 Mass. 496 (1978) (municipal/civil negligence principles; cited for negligence analysis).

Notes on Authority: Plaintiff will rely on these and other Massachusetts authorities as applicable at trial to establish Defendant’s duty to take reasonable care, Defendant’s breach by opening his door into the bike lane while distracted by his phone, the causation of Plaintiff’s injuries, and the damages sustained. Plaintiff also reserves the right to rely on additional controlling Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing the duties of motor vehicle operators, "dooring" incidents, distracted driving, and allocation of fault.

(For purposes of this Complaint, the citations above are illustrative and reference commonly-cited sources of negligence law; Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement and amend authorities and factual allegations as discovery proceeds.)
