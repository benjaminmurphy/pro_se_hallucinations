It details contract-style remedies (rescission, damages, rent withholding, repair-and-deduct, and potential punitive damages) flowing from breaches of that warranty and effectively displaces constructive eviction, thereby also touching on quiet enjoyment concepts. Thus it directly supports a proposition that the case discusses landlord duties and remedies for breaches of habitability and quiet enjoyment.",

Because we hold that the lease of a residential dwelling creates a contractual relationship between the landlord and tenant, the standard contract remedies of rescission, reformation and damages are available to the tenant when suing for breach of the implied warranty of habitability\u2026. [T]he tenant may withhold future rent, and may also seek damages in the amount of rent previously paid.\u201d"
