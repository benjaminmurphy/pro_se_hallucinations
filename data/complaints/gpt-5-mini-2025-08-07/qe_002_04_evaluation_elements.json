    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint expressly alleges that Plaintiff began tenancy on March 1, 2022, pays $1,200/month, and that Defendant is the owner and landlord of the Premises (see \u00b6\u00b62\u20133, 5). Those factual allegations sufficiently plead a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges specific omissions and acts by Defendant: failing to repair the water intrusion after notice, permitting ongoing defective conditions, and communicating a retaliatory nonrenewal/labeling Plaintiff a 'problem tenant' (see \u00b6\u00b67\u20139, 12\u201313, 19)."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges ongoing water intrusion and damp conditions, damage to personal property, continuous dehumidifier use, increased costs, and an express allegation that these conditions 'substantially interfered' with Plaintiff\u2019s use and enjoyment; the City inspector confirmed code violations (see \u00b6\u00b69\u201312, 12). Those facts allege a material/substantial interference with tenancy."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges Defendant had actual notice of the water intrusion (\u00b67), failed to timely remediate (\u00b68, 19), and that the continued water intrusion and related conditions caused the damages and need to run a dehumidifier (\u00b610\u201312). The sequence of events also supports the alleged causal link to the retaliatory nonrenewal (\u00b613)."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint specifies concrete damages: approximately $400 in ruined personal property, increased electricity costs from continuous dehumidifier use, diminution of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and requests compensatory relief (see \u00b610, \u00b611, \u00b620, Prayer B)."
