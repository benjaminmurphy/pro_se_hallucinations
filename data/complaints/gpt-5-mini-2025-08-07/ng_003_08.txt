COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Mills, and for her complaint against Defendant Lowell Home Goods, Inc., alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Mills is an adult resident of Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Lowell Home Goods, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation doing business in Lowell, Massachusetts, operating a retail discount home-goods store located at 123 Market St, Lowell, MA 01852.

3. The incident giving rise to this claim occurred on October 1, 2023, at the Defendant’s store at 123 Market St., Lowell, MA. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court under Mass. R. Civ. P. and Massachusetts law because the events and injuries complained of occurred in Middlesex County and the Defendant conducts business there.

4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this civil tort action under Massachusetts common law and applicable statutes. Plaintiff brings a single count of negligence to recover damages she sustained as a result of the Defendant’s failure to exercise ordinary care.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On October 1, 2023, at approximately mid-day, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s retail store at 123 Market St., Lowell, Massachusetts, inspecting kitchen items.

6. At all relevant times, the Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, maintained and/or had responsibility for the subject store premises, including the aisle, shelving, and display fixtures where the incident occurred.

7. Defendant displayed heavy appliance boxes (large toaster-oven boxes and similar items) stacked high on retail shelving—approximately five or six boxes high—without straps, barriers, safety stops, guard rails, netting, blocking, or other reasonably foreseeable precautions to prevent heavy boxes from shifting or falling.

8. While Plaintiff was in the aisle, another customer was pushing a shopping cart down the same aisle. That customer (not Plaintiff) lightly bumped one of the lower shelves—an ordinary, non-forceful contact consistent with normal shopping behavior.

9. As a direct and foreseeable consequence of the unstable and improperly secured stacking, a heavy toaster-oven box located near the top of the stack was dislodged and fell from the shelving and struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and the right side of her head.

10. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a severe headache. The on-site manager came to the scene, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon. Defendant made no adequate offer of medical assistance beyond the report and coupon.

11. That evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened and she sought emergency medical treatment. Emergency Department personnel diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

12. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200.00 in medical expenses and lost approximately $600.00 in wages from time missed from her employment as a delivery driver. In addition to economic losses, Plaintiff suffered pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life (including inability to participate in her weekly soccer league for approximately one month).

13. Plaintiff’s injuries, economic losses, and non-economic damages were proximately caused by the Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions as described below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 13 above as if fully set forth herein.

15. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of business invitees lawfully on its premises, including a duty to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn of dangerous conditions of which it knew or should have known, and to take reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable harm from unstable or improperly stored merchandise. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land to keep in reasonably safe condition) and § 343A; Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (recognizing negligence principles applying to actions causing injury); see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260 § 2A (statute of limitations for tort actions).

16. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
   a. Stacking heavy appliance boxes negligently high on shelving without adequate restraints, barriers, or other safety measures reasonably necessary to prevent boxes from falling;
   b. Failing to properly secure, brace, or block heavy items placed on high shelving;
   c. Failing to inspect and maintain the shelving/display area to ensure the safety of patrons and to discover and remedy the hazardous condition of unstable, unsecured merchandise;
   d. Failing to warn business invitees, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition or to cordon off or otherwise make the area safe while the hazard existed;
   e. Failing to implement or follow reasonably foreseeable safety protocols and industry standards applicable to retail merchandising of heavy goods.

17. Defendant’s breaches were a direct and proximate cause of the heavy box falling and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries, including concussion and shoulder strain, economic losses, and non-economic damages described above.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and continues to sustain:
   a. Past and future medical expenses (approximately $1,200.00 to date);
   b. Past and future lost wages (approximately $600.00 to date);
   c. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life (including temporary inability to participate in recreational soccer);
   d. Other general and special damages to be proven at trial.
