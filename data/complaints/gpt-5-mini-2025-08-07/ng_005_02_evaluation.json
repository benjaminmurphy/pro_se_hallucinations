This clearly recognizes a duty on the defendant to exercise ordinary/reasonable care under the circumstances and ties liability to breach of that duty. The discussion of \u201cordinary care\u201d and its variation with circumstances directly supports the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIf the act of hitting the plaintiff was unintentional, on the part of the defendant, and done in the doing of a lawful act, then the defendant was not liable, unless it was done in the want of exercise of due care, adapted to the exigency of the case\u2026 In using this term, ordinary care, it may be proper to state, that what constitutes ordinary care will vary with the circumstances of cases. In general, it means that kind and degree of care, which prudent and cautious men would use, such as is required by the exigency of the case\u2026\u201d"

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns whether a defendant\u2019s breach was the direct and proximate cause of a ladder falling and damaging a vehicle. Palsgraf deals with railroad guards dislodging a package of fireworks, the resulting explosion, and injury to a distant passenger, and focuses on duty and foreseeability rather than proximate cause of property damage from a falling ladder. The opinion explicitly states that the law of proximate causation is \u201cforeign to the case\u201d because there was no duty to the plaintiff, so it does not support the asserted causation proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort.\u201d"
