Emily JOHNSON
    Petitioner

v.

Michael JOHNSON
    Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties

1.1 Petitioner: Emily Johnson, residing in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Contact information for service and communications: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Respondent: Michael Johnson, last known address in Barnstable County (Cape Cod area). (The Petitioner will provide an updated address to the Court and Respondent upon filing or as soon as practicable for service.)

2. Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters pursuant to the Massachusetts probate and family court jurisdiction under the Massachusetts General Laws and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA).

2.2 Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the child resides in Barnstable County and the existing custody order was entered by this Court (or, in the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction to modify the custody order affecting a child who resides in this county).

3. Existing Order

3.1 On May 15, 2019, the Court entered an order providing that Petitioner Emily Johnson have primary physical custody of the parties’ child and that Respondent Michael Johnson have visitation on alternate weekends and one midweek overnight (Wednesdays).

3.2 Under the 2019 order, the weekly midweek overnight (Wednesdays) was feasible and minimally disruptive to the child’s school routine because both parents were living in substantially the same town and the evening residence was a short drive from the child’s school.

4. Parties’ Child

4.1 The child subject to this Complaint is:
- Sophie Johnson, age 8.

5. Material Change in Circumstances

5.1 Since entry of the 2019 order, Respondent has relocated to Cape Cod, a distance of approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school and from Petitioner’s residence.

5.2 Respondent nevertheless insists on retaining the same Wednesday overnight visitation in the same form as in 2019. Respondent picks Sophie up from school on Wednesday afternoons, drives with her the approximately ninety-mile distance to his Cape Cod residence, and returns early the following morning on Thursday, regularly awakening Sophie around 4:30 a.m. to make the drive back so she may attend school on Thursday.

5.3 As a direct result of the long midweek travel and early-morning return trips, Sophie is chronically tired during the school week. Sophie's teacher has reported a noticeable decline in her classroom participation and engagement on Thursdays and has observed that Sophie appears exhausted and less able to focus on learning tasks following the Wednesday overnight.

5.4 The burden placed on Sophie by the present midweek schedule is not temporary; Respondent’s residence on Cape Cod appears to be a long-term relocation, and the Wednesday overnight practice has continued since Respondent’s move. The ongoing nature of the disruption and its measurable adverse impact on Sophie’s education, health, and general well-being constitute a material change in circumstances since the 2019 order.

6. Legal Standard

6.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and that modification is in the child’s best interests (see, e.g., generally M.G.L. ch. 208 and case law construing the probate court’s continuing authority over custody). The Court’s paramount consideration in any custody or visitation determination is the best interests of the child, including the child’s health, safety, welfare, and educational needs.

6.2 The Petitioner alleges that the relocation of Respondent and the consequent transportation schedule impose a detrimental effect on Sophie’s health and education that was neither anticipated nor addressed by the parties at the time of the 2019 order, and therefore constitutes a material change warranting modification.

7. Facts Supporting Modification (Specific Allegations)

7.1 The midweek Wednesday overnight requires Sophie to be transported about ninety (90) miles round-trip from school to Respondent’s Cape Cod residence and back to school the next morning.

7.2 The early-morning return trips routinely require Sophie to wake at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursdays in order to arrive at school on time.

7.3 Sophie's teacher has directly observed and reported a decline in class participation and daytime alertness on Thursdays. Petitioner has documented multiple instances of Sophie falling asleep earlier than usual in the evening, increased daytime fatigue, and decreased school performance and participation on Thursdays.

7.4 Respondent has been repeatedly informed of the impact of the midweek travel on Sophie but has declined to agree to a modification of the midweek schedule or to reasonable alternatives (e.g., replacement of the midweek overnight with an extended weekend, virtual evening contact in lieu of overnight, alternating Wednesday dinners without overnight, or other arrangements that avoid long school-night travel).

7.5 Petitioner has a concern that continuation of the Wednesday overnight, under the present circumstances, poses a risk of continued educational harm and diminished physical and emotional well-being for Sophie.

8. Relief Requested

WHEREFORE, Petitioner Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court:

8.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2019 custody order, specifically Respondent’s relocation to Cape Cod and the ongoing practice of transporting the child for a midweek overnight that requires early-morning travel back to school and which materially and adversely affects the child’s health and educational performance.

8.2 Issue a temporary ex parte order, if appropriate based on the Court’s determination and record, modifying the custody/visitation schedule pending a hearing, including but not limited to suspending or eliminating the midweek Wednesday overnight visitation pending final determination (or, in the alternative, imposing restrictions or modifications to prevent school-night long-distance travel).

8.3 After notice and hearing, enter a final order modifying the parties’ custody/visitation arrangement to protect the child’s best interests. Specifically, Petitioner requests:

    a. Elimination of the midweek (Wednesday) overnight visitation in the current format that requires round-trip ninety-mile travel on school nights; and

    b. Adjustment of Respondent’s visitation schedule to provide meaningful parenting time that does not require the child to undertake long-distance travel on school nights, such as:
       - extending Respondent’s alternate weekend to a Friday afternoon through Sunday evening schedule on alternating weekends (or otherwise shifting overnights to non-school nights), or
       - permitting other arrangements mutually acceptable to the parties or ordered by the Court (e.g., overnight visits on non-school nights, exchanges at or near school to avoid long drives, virtual contact during school nights, or other measures tailored to Sophie's best interests);

    c. Any other order the Court deems in the child’s best interests, including orders for parenting coordination, counseling for the child if appropriate, and orders authorizing the Court to review school records and obtain teacher statements or evaluations relevant to the child’s educational performance and welfare.

8.4 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to costs, fees, and any necessary findings to effectuate the modification.

9. Notice and Hearing

9.1 Petitioner requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint and issue appropriate notice to Respondent.

9.2 Petitioner requests that the Court consider provision of interim relief (as requested above) to prevent ongoing harm to the child pending final hearing and determination.

10. Verification

10.1 I, Emily Johnson, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the facts set forth in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

If you do not understand this document, you should consult an attorney or self-help resources at the Probate and Family Court.

AUTHORITIES (for the Court’s consideration)

(Note: Petitioner submits the following statutes and authorities commonly relied upon in custody-modification matters in Massachusetts and in federal parental-rights jurisprudence. Petitioner requests the Court apply the statutes and applicable case law in determining the best interests of the child and whether a material change in circumstances exists warranting modification.)

Statutes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act — UCCJEA)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (provisions governing divorce and related custody determinations, and court authority over custody orders)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (inclusive of provisions concerning the protection and welfare of children and authority of courts to consider children’s welfare) [as applicable]
- Rules of the Probate and Family Court (local rules and Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure as applied in custody matters)

Representative Case Law and Legal Principles
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing fundamental parental rights and the need to consider parental decisionmaking balanced with the child’s best interests)
- Cases and precedent construing the “best interests of the child” standard in Massachusetts Probate and Family Court (including binding SJC and Appeals Court decisions interpreting the court’s modification authority and best-interests considerations)

Petitioner respectfully requests the Court consider all statutory provisions and case law relevant to custody modification, including but not limited to the authorities specifically cited above, and others addressing material change in circumstances, the best interests standard, and parental relocation in the context of visitation and custody modification.
