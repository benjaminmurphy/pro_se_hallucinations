  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff entered into a tenancy beginning June 1, 2022, pays monthly rent to Defendant, and identifies Defendant as owner and landlord of 123 Maple Street (\u00b6\u00b62\u20134, 12). These facts sufficiently plead a landlord-tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant was notified of lack of hot water, acknowledged the problem, ordered a part, but failed to complete an effective repair and hot water remained unavailable for ~three weeks (\u00b6\u00b66\u20139). Those allegations state an act/omission by the landlord (failure to timely restore service)."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads concrete, specific impacts: inability to bathe comfortably, taking baby elsewhere for baths, boiling water to wash dishes, changed routines, and ongoing disruption to safety, comfort, and reasonable use of the home (\u00b6\u00b610\u201311). Those allegations adequately describe a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint links the landlord's failure to repair/restore hot water directly to the loss of hot water and resulting impairments and expenses, alleging the interference occurred 'as a direct and proximate result' of Defendant's conduct (\u00b6\u00b68\u201310, 18). Those factual allegations adequately plead causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges out-of-pocket expenses (gym/showers, transportation, costs related to bathing the baby, boiling water), requests rent abatement, estimates $450 in economic damages, and seeks compensatory relief (\u00b6\u00b610, 21\u201322). These allegations sufficiently plead damages."
