COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE (Personal Injury)

1. PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE
1.1 Plaintiff Jason Callahan (“Plaintiff”) is an individual and resident of Brockton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”) is a community center that operates programs for children, including the after-school program referenced in this Complaint, with a location at 123 Main St, Brockton, Massachusetts.
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the general jurisdictional statutes and the District Court’s authority to hear civil actions for personal injury. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court because the acts and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts (123 Main St).
1.4 This action is timely. The incident giving rise to this claim occurred on September 15, 2023. Pursuant to the Massachusetts statute of limitations for personal injury actions, M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A, this action is commenced within the time allowed by law.

2. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
2.1 At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant operated an after-school program at the Brockton Community Center that provided physical activity and gym supervision for children, including Plaintiff’s son.
2.2 Defendant advertised to parents and the public that children in the program would be supervised at all times while in the gym.
2.3 On September 15, 2023, at approximately the time of the incident, there were approximately twenty (20) children in the gym for the after‑school program at Defendant’s Brockton facility.
2.4 Defendant had assigned two staff members to supervise the children in the gym that day. One staff member left the gym to do paperwork in the office, leaving only one staff member physically in the gym.
2.5 The remaining staff member was mostly looking at her cell phone while stationed near the bleachers and was not actively supervising the children.
2.6 Two older boys, approximately twelve (12) years of age, began playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood gym floor.
2.7 Several children informed the staff member that the two older boys were engaging in dangerous rough play, but the staff member responded dismissively, saying, “boys will be boys,” and took no effective action to stop the dangerous activity.
2.8 Plaintiff’s eight (8) year‑old son, who is small for his age, was unexpectedly tackled hard by one of the older boys during that rough play, struck his head on the hardwood floor, and was rendered unconscious for an estimated thirty (30) seconds.
2.9 As a result of the tackle, Plaintiff’s son suffered a concussion and related injuries, was transported to the emergency room, missed several days of school, and incurred medical expenses of approximately $3,500. Plaintiff did not suffer lost wages.
2.10 The injuries described above were caused by the lack of adequate supervision and by Defendant’s failure to intervene to prevent dangerous conduct in the gym.

3. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE (single claim)
(Claim I — Negligence)
3.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1.1 through 2.10 above as if set forth fully herein.
3.2 At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff’s son (and the other children in its care) a duty to exercise reasonable care to provide safe premises and safe activities, to supervise the children in its care, to properly staff the after‑school program, to prevent foreseeable harm, and to warn of and remedy dangerous conditions and activities.
3.3 Defendant breached its duties of care in multiple respects, including but not limited to:
   a. failing to provide adequate adult supervision in the gym during an activity for which supervision was warranted and was advertised;
   b. leaving only one staff member to supervise approximately twenty children engaged in gym activities;
   c. allowing staff on duty to engage in inattentive behavior (e.g., focusing on a cell phone) rather than supervising the children;
   d. failing to stop or reasonably control the older children when they engaged in foreseeable, dangerous rough play after other children reported the conduct;
   e. failing to train and/or supervise its staff adequately to prevent foreseeable risky conduct among children in the program.
3.4 Defendant’s acts and omissions were negligent and a proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff’s son, including his concussion, the resulting medical treatment, pain and suffering, physical impairment, emotional distress, and other compensable damages.
3.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s son suffered physical injury and impairment, incurred medical expenses of approximately $3,500, missed school, and suffered other general damages. Plaintiff has incurred and continues to incur medical expenses and other damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

4. DAMAGES
4.1 As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of Defendant, Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages including but not limited to:
   a. medical and related expenses (past and future) in an amount to be established at trial (approximately $3,500 to date);
   b. general damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be established at trial;
   c. any other relief the Court deems just and proper.
4.2 Plaintiff has not claimed any wage loss damages.

5. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:
   a. for compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including medical expenses of approximately $3,500 and general damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress;
   b. for costs and interest allowed by law;
   c. for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

6. JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
