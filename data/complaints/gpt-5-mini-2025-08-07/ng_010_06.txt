COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual and resident of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant John Smith is the owner and occupant of the residential property located at 123 Maple St, Pittsfield, MA 01201 (the “Property”).
1.3 This Court has subject matter jurisdiction because this action arises under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and seeks damages in excess of the jurisdictional minimum of the Superior Court.
1.4 Venue is proper in Berkshire County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Statement of Facts
2.1 On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately [time not known], Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple St., Pittsfield, Massachusetts, carrying grocery bags.
2.2 On or before August 15, 2023, and for a long period of time prior to that date, one of the major limbs/branches of a large maple tree located on or overhanging the Property had been visibly cracked, droopy, and unstable. The cracked branch extended over the sidewalk used by pedestrians.
2.3 Plaintiff and multiple neighbors observed and reasonably perceived the cracked and drooping condition of the branch. Neighbors reported having informed Defendant of the dangerous condition and suggested that Defendant have the tree inspected and any hazardous limbs removed. Defendant acknowledged the reports and told neighbors he would “deal with it in the spring,” but Defendant took no reasonable steps to inspect, secure, or remove the dangerous branch prior to August 15, 2023.
2.4 During a routine summer thunderstorm on August 15, 2023, under ordinary weather conditions (i.e., no extreme weather such as tornadoes or other extraordinary events), the visibly cracked branch suddenly and without warning fractured and fell onto Plaintiff’s shoulder and back as she walked beneath it. The impact caused Plaintiff to fall to the ground.
2.5 As a direct and proximate result of the falling branch, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, required medical treatment, and missed approximately one week of work at her retail job.
2.6 Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical expenses to date are approximately $1,200. Plaintiff’s lost wages to date are approximately $600. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, mental anguish, and inconvenience, and may incur additional medical expenses and future lost wages.

3. Count I — Negligence
(Against Defendant John Smith)

3.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations of Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.6 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully using the public sidewalk adjacent to his property, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance and condition of trees and branches overhanging the public way and to take reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable harm from dangerous conditions on his property that he knew or reasonably should have known about.
3.3 Defendant breached that duty by failing to take reasonable steps to inspect, warn of, secure, or remove the visibly cracked and drooping major branch, despite actual knowledge and notice of its dangerous condition and despite being aware that the branch overhung a publicly used sidewalk.
3.4 Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. The falling branch was a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to act, and the injuries sustained by Plaintiff were the natural and probable consequence of that breach.
3.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, incurred medical expenses, lost earnings, and suffered pain and suffering and other damages.

4. Damages
4.1 As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff has suffered the following compensable losses and damages:
    a. Past medical expenses: approximately $1,200;
    b. Lost wages: approximately $600;
    c. Past and future physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial;
    d. Interest, costs, and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
4.2 Plaintiff demands judgment for damages in an amount to be determined at trial but in excess of $25,000, together with interest, costs, and such other relief as this Court deems proper. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend and specify further special damages as discovery proceeds.
