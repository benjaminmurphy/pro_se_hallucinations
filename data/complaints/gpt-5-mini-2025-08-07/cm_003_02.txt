Docket No.: ___________________

JESSICA MARTINEZ,
    Petitioner,
v.

MICHAEL THOMPSON,
    Respondent.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER
(Modification of Custody / Request for Temporary Relief)

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Jessica Martinez, a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com. Petitioner appears pro se.
1.2 Respondent: Michael Thompson, parent of the minor child named below. Respondent resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.
1.3 Child: Ethan Thompson, age 8, born in approximately 2017, who is the subject of the custody order entered in this Court.
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, M.G.L. c. 209C. Venue is proper in Bristol County because the child resides in this county and the original custody order was entered by this Court.

2. Background and Existing Order
2.1 On September 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order awarding the parties shared legal custody of Ethan, with Ethan primarily residing with Petitioner, Jessica Martinez, and visiting Respondent, Michael Thompson, on certain weekends (the “Existing Order”).
2.2 At the time the Existing Order was entered, the Court found both parents able to co-parent and to provide a safe and stable environment for Ethan.

3. Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, a material change in circumstances has occurred that affects Ethan’s safety and welfare.
3.2 Over the past several months Ethan has made repeated statements to Petitioner that cause serious safety concerns. Ethan has told Petitioner that there are “special drinks” at Respondent’s home and that sometimes Respondent “can’t walk straight” when caring for him.
3.3 A neighbor familiar with the family’s arrangements provided Petitioner with video evidence showing Respondent stumbling while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night. The neighbor supplied the video to Petitioner on or about [recent months]; the video shows Respondent unsteady on his feet while handling the child during a late-night transfer.
3.4 The school has reported to Petitioner that Ethan appears exhausted and fatigued every Monday morning following weekend visitation with Respondent. School staff have expressed concern about Ethan’s diminished energy and attentiveness on Monday mornings.
3.5 Taken together—Ethan’s statements, the neighbor’s video showing Respondent unsteady, and the school’s reports of exhaustion—these facts constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since September 15, 2021 and raise credible concerns for the child’s safety when in Respondent’s care.

4. Legal Standard
4.1 The best interests of the child is the controlling standard for custody and visitation modifications. See M.G.L. c. 209, §31 (best interests standard); see also M.G.L. c. 209C (UCCJEA) (governing jurisdictional and enforcement matters).
4.2 A party seeking modification must show that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the prior order and that modification is in the child’s best interests. See M.G.L. c. 209, §31; see also, e.g., Custody of a Minor, 400 Mass. 150 (1987) (modification requires material change affecting welfare of the child); Matter of Custody of a Minor, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 283 (1992).
4.3 Where there is evidence that a child may be at risk of harm while in the care of a parent, the Court may issue temporary or emergency relief, including supervised visitation or suspension of overnights, pending a full hearing. See M.G.L. c. 119, §51A (mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect) and M.G.L. c. 209, §§30–31 (authority to modify custody orders in best interests of child).

5. Specific Allegations Supporting Modification
5.1 Ethan’s repeated statements about “special drinks” and Respondent’s impaired mobility while caring for him indicate a plausible risk of Respondent’s intoxication or impairment while exercising custodial time.
5.2 The neighbor’s video documenting Respondent stumbling with Ethan in his care provides direct evidence that Respondent has at times been unsteady and possibly impaired while supervising the child.
5.3 The school’s consistent observations that Ethan is exhausted each Monday strongly correlate with weekend visits and suggest that Ethan’s welfare and routine have been disrupted by conditions occurring while with Respondent.
5.4 These facts, considered together, create an evidentiary basis for the Court to find a material change in circumstances since the 2021 order and to conclude that modification is necessary to protect Ethan’s health and safety and to serve his best interests.

6. Relief Requested
Petitioner therefore requests that the Court enter the following relief:
6.1 A temporary order, effective immediately and pending a full hearing on the merits, modifying the Existing Order to require that all weekend custodial time with Respondent be supervised by a neutral third-party supervisor approved by the Court or supervised through a professional supervised visitation provider. Alternatively, Petitioner requests that overnights be suspended until the Court determines otherwise.
6.2 An order requiring Respondent to undergo and provide documentation of substance screening (e.g., random/for-cause toxicology screens) if the Court deems such screening appropriate to address the allegations of impairment.
6.3 An order that school personnel and any other relevant professionals be authorized to communicate with Petitioner and the Court regarding Ethan’s observed condition and any relevant reports.
6.4 An order referring the matter to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) pursuant to M.G.L. c. 119, §51A, if the Court finds reasonable cause to suspect neglect or abuse, and any other protective investigations the Court deems appropriate.
6.5 A hearing on an expedited basis to consider the requested temporary relief and to set a schedule for a full evidentiary hearing on permanent modification of custody and visitation.
6.6 Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including costs and such further orders as are necessary to protect the welfare of Ethan.

Petitioner relies on the statutes and case law governing custody modification, jurisdiction, and child protection in Massachusetts, including but not limited to:
