Michael Turner
    Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/PHYSICAL CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
   a. Petitioner: Jessica Turner, 617-555-0123, psm1443@gmail.com, residing at 0 [Address omitted for filing privacy — to be inserted by Petitioner].
   b. Respondent: Michael Turner, residing at [Respondent’s address to be inserted for service].

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   a. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law governing domestic relations and child custody, including the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C.
   b. Venue is proper in this Court (Worcester Probate and Family Court) because the parties’ minor child resides in Worcester County and the prior custody order was entered in this Court.

3. Prior Order
   a. On or about March 15, 2018, this Court (Worcester Probate and Family Court) entered an order awarding primary physical residence of the parties’ minor child, Emily Turner (born [approximate birth year 2015], presently ten years old), to Respondent, Michael Turner, with Petitioner awarded limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner visit. A true and correct copy of the relevant existing order is on file with the Court or will be provided at hearing.

4. Nature of Relief Sought
   a. Petitioner seeks a modification of the existing custody/physical custody order to increase Petitioner’s parenting time/physical custody with Emily and to adjust the parenting schedule to reflect materially changed circumstances and Emily’s best interests. Petitioner seeks (i) a presumptive schedule of increased overnight and weekday parenting time with Petitioner (to include at least two weeknights and expanded weekends and holiday/vacation time), and/or (ii) an order for shared physical custody or such other schedule as the Court deems in Emily’s best interests. Petitioner also seeks temporary relief increasing parenting time pending final hearing if the Court finds it appropriate.

5. Material Change in Circumstances
   Petitioner alleges the following facts establishing a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 order:
   a. At the time of the 2018 order Petitioner was a graduate student living in a small studio apartment with limited availability due to school commitments; those circumstances were material to the Parenting Plan entered by the Court.
   b. Since entry of the 2018 order, Petitioner’s circumstances have materially changed in that:
      i. Petitioner has completed graduate school (degree completed prior to the filing of this Complaint).
      ii. Petitioner is currently employed in stable full-time work with regular daytime hours and predictable schedule, enabling Petitioner to provide consistent weekday care and transportation.
      iii. Petitioner now resides in a two-bedroom apartment suitable for a child and has a separate bedroom available for Emily.
      iv. Petitioner has an age-appropriate, safe home environment and resources appropriate to the child’s needs.
   c. The change in Petitioner’s circumstances was not contemplated by the 2018 order and is material and substantial.

6. Child’s Welfare and Best Interests
   a. Emily is now ten years old. Since the 2018 order, Emily’s relationship with Petitioner has developed into a close, nurturing bond. Emily expresses a clear preference for spending more time overnight and during the week with Petitioner.
   b. Emily’s therapist has informed Petitioner that Emily feels guilty when visits with Petitioner are short and has recommended more consistent time with Petitioner for Emily’s emotional well-being. Petitioner asserts that Emily has submitted a written statement/letter to the Court expressing Emily’s desire for additional overnights and more time with Petitioner; a copy of such letter is available for filing with the Court, subject to the Court’s procedures regarding in camera review and consideration of a child’s statement.
   c. Respondent has been unwilling to negotiate an increase in Petitioner’s parenting time. Respondent declines to discuss modification and becomes angry when Emily raises the topic, impeding cooperative decision-making and communication between the parents.
   d. In light of Petitioner’s substantially changed circumstances, Emily’s expressed preferences, and the therapist’s recommendations, modification of the current schedule to permit increased parenting time with Petitioner is in Emily’s best interests and welfare.

7. Legal Basis for Relief
   a. Under Massachusetts law, modification of a prior custody or physical custody order is appropriate where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and the proposed modification serves the best interests of the child. Petitioner asserts that the facts set forth above constitute such a material and substantial change and that the requested modification is in the child’s best interests.
   b. Jurisdiction is governed by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, which governs the authority of this Court to modify custody orders where the child resides and where a prior order was entered.

8. Temporary Relief
   Petitioner requests that the Court consider granting temporary increased parenting time to Petitioner pending final hearing, to reduce harm to Emily that may result from continued short visits and to provide continuity of care consistent with Petitioner’s new stable circumstances. Petitioner requests a specific temporary schedule as the Court deems appropriate (for example, additional weeknight overnight(s) and expanded weekend time), or such other temporary arrangements deemed necessary by the Court.

9. Notice to Other Parties
   Petitioner requests that the Court issue appropriate process directing Respondent to appear and respond to this Complaint, and that Petitioner be permitted to effect service in accordance with Massachusetts law and Court rules.

10. Requests for Relief (Prayer for Relief)
   WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order as follows:
   a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the March 15, 2018 custody/parenting order and that modification is warranted;
   b. Modify the existing custody/parenting order to increase Petitioner’s parenting time and physical custody with Emily, including an award of expanded overnights and weekday parenting time (for example, two weeknights and expanded weekend/holiday and vacation time), or, in the alternative, an order of shared physical custody with a schedule to be determined by the Court that is in Emily’s best interests;
   c. Grant temporary increased parenting time to Petitioner pending final hearing as the Court deems appropriate;
   d. Order such other relief as the Court deems just and proper in the interests of Emily’s welfare and best interests, including but not limited to allocation of parental decision-making, transportation arrangements, and orders for communication and cooperation between the parties; and
   e. Award costs and such other relief as the Court deems equitable.
