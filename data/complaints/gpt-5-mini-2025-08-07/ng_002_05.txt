COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, pro se, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Thomas Baker, alleges as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and resident of Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Thomas Baker is an individual who resides in or can be served in Massachusetts. On information and belief, at all times relevant, Defendant owned, had control of, and permitted a large dog to run at large at Chestnut Hill Park, Newton, Massachusetts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton, Massachusetts and the claim is within the jurisdictional limits of the Newton District Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at approximately in the afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a public path at Chestnut Hill Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

6. Prominent park signage posted at Chestnut Hill Park states that dogs must be on leashes. Defendant was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the park rules requiring dogs to be leashed.

7. On that date Defendant allowed his large dog to run free and off-leash in the area, even though signs required dogs to be leashed and despite there being other park users present.

8. As Plaintiff jogged on the path, Defendant’s dog suddenly charged at Plaintiff, barking loudly. The dog ran toward Plaintiff and the dog’s sudden approach caused Plaintiff to fear an imminent bite or attack.

9. Defendant was situated approximately thirty (30) feet away talking with friends, holding a leash over his shoulder, but not attaching the leash to the dog and not exercising control over the animal.

10. Fearing she would be bitten or otherwise harmed, Plaintiff swerved off the path to avoid contact with the dog.

11. While swerving off the path, Plaintiff tripped over a protruding tree root and fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path.

12. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist. Plaintiff was transported to an emergency room, received medical treatment, and was required to wear a wrist brace for several weeks.

13. Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,000.00 in medical expenses arising from the emergency treatment, diagnostic testing, and follow-up care for the broken wrist.

14. Plaintiff missed work as a result of the injury and associated treatment, suffering lost wages of approximately $1,200.00.

15. Plaintiff also missed a piano recital for which she had been preparing, suffering non-economic harms including emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment.

16. The dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff; however, Defendant’s failure to control the dog and to keep it on a leash (in violation of posted park rules) was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s swerve, fall, and resulting injuries.

17. Several other joggers and park users witnessed the incident and observed the dog charging and Defendant’s lack of control over the dog.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.

19. At all times material hereto, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent foreseeable harm to others using the park, including the duty: (a) to keep the dog under control; (b) to comply with posted leash requirements; and (c) not to allow a dangerous condition (an unrestrained large dog) to exist where it could foreseeably create a risk of harm to park users.

20. Defendant breached this duty by negligently allowing the dog to run off-leash and uncontrolled in a public area with posted leash requirements; by failing to keep the dog under control; by failing to leash the dog; and by otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care to prevent the dog from charging and frightening other park users.

21. Defendant’s breaches were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries: Plaintiff reasonably swerved to avoid being bitten or attacked by Defendant’s dog, which caused her to trip and fall on a tree root and down an embankment, fracturing her wrist and sustaining other damages and losses described herein.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:
   a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,000.00;
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00;
   c. Past and future physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life and of specific activities (including the piano recital);
   d. Other damages to be proven at trial.

23. Plaintiff’s damages were proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, and Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages permitted by law.

APPLICABLE LAW

24. Plaintiff alleges her claims under governing Massachusetts negligence law, including the duty to exercise reasonable care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages principles as recognized under Massachusetts common law and statute. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282 (duty to exercise reasonable care), 302B (liability for physical harm caused by an animal), 321 (care required of persons in control of dangerous animals), 323 (negligence resulting in physical harm), and related provisions.

25. Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts comparative fault principles (apportionment of damages if Defendant alleges any contributory fault on Plaintiff’s part), including Massachusetts statutory and decisional law concerning comparative negligence and allocation of fault. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 and applicable Massachusetts precedent addressing comparative negligence and apportionment of fault.

26. Plaintiff will rely upon relevant Massachusetts decisions and authorities at trial demonstrating the principles that:
   - owners and keepers of animals may be liable for harms that are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of allowing animals to run at large or to escape control;
   - owners owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent their animals from creating dangerous conditions for others;
   - negligent acts that create a foreseeable risk of injury (including forcing another to take evasive action that leads to harm) can constitute actionable negligence if they are a proximate cause of harm.

27. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Plaintiff intends to rely at trial on Massachusetts statutes and case law interpreting duties and standards of care in negligence cases, applicable Restatement (Second) of Torts provisions, and Massachusetts pattern instructions on negligence and comparative fault. Plaintiff will cite the specific authorities and supporting Massachusetts decisions with particularity at or before trial and requests leave to supplement this pleading with citations to controlling authorities as required by court rules.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

28. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:
   1. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,000.00 (past medical expenses);
   2. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00 (past lost earnings);
   3. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other general damages in an amount to be proven at trial;

B. Costs of suit and reasonable interest where applicable;

C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
