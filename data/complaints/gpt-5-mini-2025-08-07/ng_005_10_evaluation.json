      "support_reasoning": "The case articulates a general negligence standard\u2014that a defendant doing a lawful act is liable only if he fails to exercise due or ordinary care appropriate to the circumstances. It does not involve or discuss any duty relating to storing, securing, or maintaining a ladder, nor does it address duties concerning a shared driveway or premises liability. Thus, while it is broadly relevant to reasonable care, it does not specifically support the proposition about a duty in the context of ladder storage in a shared driveway.",

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns proximate cause and asserts that defendant\u2019s breach was the direct and proximate cause of the ladder\u2019s fall and resulting property damage. Palsgraf does not involve a ladder or damage to an automobile, and Cardozo\u2019s opinion explicitly brackets off proximate cause, focusing instead on duty and foreseeability. The case is actually authority that there was no actionable negligence toward the plaintiff, not that a defendant\u2019s breach was the direct and proximate cause of a particular harm, so it does not support the stated proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort.\""
