It does not discuss premises liability, invitees, or any duty to exercise reasonable care to protect invitees from dangerous conditions. Therefore it does not support the proposition cited about the well\u2011established duty of care to invitees in Massachusetts.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The Attorney General represents the Commonwealth as well as the Secretary, agency or department head who requests his appearance. G.L.c. 12, \u00a7 3. He also has a common law duty to represent the public interest. Attorney Gen. v. Trustees of Boston Elev. Ry. 319 Mass. 642, 652 (1946). Jacobson v. Parks & Recreation Commn. of Boston, 345 Mass. 641, 644 (1963). Thus, when an agency head recommends a course of action, the Attorney General must consider the ramifications of that action on the interests of the Commonwealth and the public generally, as well as on the official himself and his agency."

It does not concern premises liability, invitees, or any duty to exercise reasonable care to protect invitees from dangerous conditions. Therefore it does not provide authority for the stated Massachusetts duty-of-care proposition.",

Similarly it would be an overreaching amounting to a fraud for an attorney to enter into a contractual arrangement with a client known or suspected to be of limited understanding \u2014 unless, indeed, the client had independent representation."
