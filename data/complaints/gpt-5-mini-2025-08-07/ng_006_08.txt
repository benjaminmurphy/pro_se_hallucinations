COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1.     Parties

1.1    Plaintiff Jordan Miller ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2    Defendant Alex Chen ("Defendant") is an individual who at all relevant times was operating a motor vehicle and was present at the scene of the incident described below. Upon information and belief Defendant resides in Massachusetts and may be served at his usual residence or at a location to be discovered through pretrial process.

2.     Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts common law of torts and the general jurisdictional statutes because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2.2    Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court because the incident occurred in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts (200 Park Drive, Boston, MA 02215) and the Defendant resides or does business in this county.

3.     Factual Allegations

3.1    On July 15, 2023, at approximately [time not known to Plaintiff], Plaintiff was lawfully riding a bicycle to work in a marked bicycle lane on 200 Park Drive in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiff was obeying all applicable traffic laws and was wearing a helmet.

3.2    At the same time and place, Defendant was operating or occupying a vehicle that was parked in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bicycle lane.

3.3    Without checking for oncoming cyclists or looking into his side mirror and while Defendant was apparently distracted by his phone, Defendant suddenly opened the vehicle’s passenger/driver door directly into the bicycle lane while Plaintiff was passing.

3.4    Defendant opened the door widely and without warning, directly into Plaintiff’s path. Plaintiff had no time to stop or swerve and collided with the edge of Defendant’s vehicle door.

3.5    As a result of the collision with the door, Plaintiff was thrown from the bicycle and struck the pavement, suffering injuries and property damage.

3.6    At the scene Defendant admitted that he "didn't see" Plaintiff because he was checking his phone. Subsequently, Defendant’s insurer disputed responsibility and told Plaintiff that Defendant claimed Plaintiff was "weaving in and out of traffic." Plaintiff did not weave and at all times rode lawfully in the marked bike lane.

3.7    Plaintiff’s injuries included road rash on arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and a damaged bicycle frame. Plaintiff incurred medical and dental expenses of approximately $1,200 and lost wages of approximately $600. Plaintiff also was required to replace the bicycle, incurring additional property damage and replacement costs (amount to be established at trial).

3.8    All of the foregoing damages and losses were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent and careless acts and omissions as alleged herein.

4.     Count I — Negligence

4.1    Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 3.8 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2    At all times relevant to this action, Defendant owed a duty to other road users, including cyclists lawfully using the bicycle lane, to exercise reasonable care in the operation and control of his vehicle and any vehicle doors, and to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm.

4.3    Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
       (a) opening the vehicle door into an active bicycle lane without looking for approaching cyclists;
       (b) failing to check mirrors or look before opening the door;
       (c) opening the door while distracted by a mobile phone;
       (d) failing to yield to and avoid reasonably foreseeable harm to lawful users of the bicycle lane; and
       (e) otherwise failing to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.

4.4    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of duty, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical and dental expenses of approximately $1,200, lost wages of approximately $600, damage to and loss of the bicycle, and other general and special damages to be established at trial.

4.5    The harm to Plaintiff was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligent conduct.

4.6    Plaintiff has satisfied any and all conditions precedent to the commencement of this action, and/or such conditions have been excused or are inapplicable.

5.     Damages

5.1    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff claims:
       (a) Past and future medical and dental expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (past medical/dental expenses to date approximately $1,200);
       (b) Past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity in an amount to be proven at trial (past lost wages approximately $600);
       (c) Past and future property damage and replacement costs for Plaintiff’s bicycle and related equipment in an amount to be proven at trial;
       (d) Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience in an amount to be proven at trial;
       (e) Costs of suit, interest, and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

6.     Demand for Jury Trial

6.1    Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

7.     Applicable Legal Principles

7.1    This action is governed by Massachusetts law concerning negligence — the elements of duty, breach, causation, and damages — and by applicable provisions of the Massachusetts motor vehicle laws and common law requiring operators and occupants of vehicles to exercise reasonable care so as not to create hazards for other road users, including bicyclists.

7.2    (Plaintiff relies on the relevant Massachusetts statutory and common law authorities on negligence and motor vehicle operation and will present such authorities, cases and statutory provisions at the appropriate time in the litigation, including at pretrial proceedings and trial.)

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against Defendant as follows:

A.     Awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past medical and dental expenses (approximately $1,200), past lost wages (approximately $600), property damage and replacement costs for the bicycle, and other special and general damages;

B.     Awarding pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C.     Awarding costs of suit and other relief permitted by law; and

D.     Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
