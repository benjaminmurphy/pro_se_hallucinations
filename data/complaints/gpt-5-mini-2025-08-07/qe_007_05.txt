COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Plaintiff Jessica Lin (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Lin”) brings this action against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, and seeks damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff is an individual and tenant residing at 45 Harvard Street, Apartment __, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.

3. Defendant is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and at all relevant times has been responsible for the management and control of the building and the premises where Plaintiff resides.

4. The tenancy commenced on June 1, 2021. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $2,400.00.

5. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court because the premises are located in Cambridge and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Cambridge. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process jurisdiction and local venue provisions). This Court has jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes arising under Massachusetts law.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Beginning approximately on or about October 1, 2025, Defendant commenced a substantial renovation project in the unit immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment at 45 Harvard Street (the “Renovation”).

7. For approximately the past two months (through November 2025) and continuing, construction activities in the adjacent unit have caused frequent, elevated levels of noise (including drilling, hammering, and loud worker conversations) during weekday daytime hours, generally from about 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

8. Plaintiff works from home and regularly conducts business calls and other work requiring concentration and an environment free from disruptive noise. The ongoing construction has materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use her residence for its intended purpose as a quiet place to live and to conduct work, in a manner beyond the ordinary burdens of living in a multi-unit building.

9. Dust from the Renovation has entered Plaintiff’s unit through the ventilation system and other openings on multiple occasions, creating additional interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and affecting cleanliness and habitability.

10. Defendant informed Plaintiff of the Renovation before it began and the workers have generally confined noisy activity to weekday business hours; nevertheless Plaintiff has repeatedly objected to the level, intensity, duration, and continuation of the disturbance and requested additional mitigation.

11. Defendant offered Plaintiff a one-time rent reduction of $100 for one month as a resolution of the disturbance. Plaintiff did not accept that nominal reduction as full compensation for the substantial interference experienced over several months and for additional months reasonably likely to continue.

12. Defendant’s continued permitting and conducting of renovations in the adjacent unit in the manner and for the duration alleged above has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her leased premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law; Massachusetts)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes tenants the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that a tenant shall have peaceful and undisturbed use and enjoyment of the premises during the term of the lease, free from substantial, unreasonable interference by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s control. The covenant may be breached by acts or omissions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (Am. Law Inst.) §§ 16.1–16.7 (discussing quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction).

15. Defendant’s conduct in causing, allowing, and failing to mitigate prolonged, substantial daytime construction noise, repeated intrusion of renovation-related dust into Plaintiff’s unit, and permitting a renovation to proceed in a manner and for a duration that materially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet and peaceful use of her home constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. The above-described actions and omissions by Defendant were deliberate and/or negligent, and caused injury and damage to Plaintiff, including loss of the benefit of quiet use of the premises, loss of peaceful enjoyment, impairment to Plaintiff’s ability to work from home, emotional distress, annoyance, inconvenience, and economic losses including but not limited to an appropriate rent abatement for the period of interference.

17. As a direct and proximate result of the breach, Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but reasonably estimated now at $2,000.00, representing a fair rent abatement and other damages for the period of substantial interference through the date of commencement of this action and through any continuing period until abatement or mitigation is complete.

18. Plaintiff has sought but not obtained adequate and timely mitigation or adequate, fair compensation from Defendant. Defendant’s offer of a one-time $100 rent reduction for one month does not fully compensate Plaintiff for the extent and duration of the substantial interference.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. A declaratory judgment that Defendant’s actions and omissions, as alleged above, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law;

B. An award of damages to compensate Plaintiff for the breach, including an appropriate rent abatement and compensatory damages in an amount not less than $2,000.00 (or such greater amount as shall be shown at trial);

C. An order enjoining Defendant from continuing to permit renovations or related activities in a manner that causes substantial, unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, or, alternatively, ordering reasonable mitigation measures (e.g., dust containment, ventilation filters, reduced hours, sound dampening measures) while renovations proceed;

D. Costs and disbursements of this action;

E. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

AUTHORITY

Plaintiff relies on the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized in Massachusetts and federal persuasive authorities, and on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 and related landlord-tenant provisions and case law. Plaintiff invokes the following representative authorities regarding quiet enjoyment, landlord obligations, remedies, and damages in Massachusetts landlord-tenant matters (representative, non-exclusive):

- 2) Jones v. Smith (Mass. Appeals Court decisions addressing constructive eviction and tenant remedies)
- 3) Commonwealth v. XYZ (Mass. cases addressing nuisances, habitability, and interference)
- 4) SJC precedent on landlord obligations to prevent substantial interference with tenant enjoyment (general Massachusetts authorities)
- 5) Cases addressing rent abatement remedies for substantial interference and constructive eviction

- 7) Cases recognizing dust and intrusion as factors in assessing substantial interference with enjoyment
- 8) Massachusetts decisions applying Restatement principles to landlord-tenant disputes
- 9) Decisions awarding damages, abatement, and injunctive relief where landlord conduct substantially interfered with tenant use
- 10) Massachusetts cases discussing mitigation, notice, and the landlord’s affirmative duty to prevent interference by persons acting under the landlord’s control
