COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Avery Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by way of Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Avery Johnson is an individual and a tenant residing at 45 Elm Street, Apartment [unit number if any], Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and at all times relevant was the landlord of the unit Plaintiff rents.

3. Plaintiff entered into possession of the premises on or about May 1, 2022, and has continuously paid rent of $2,200.00 per month.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Cambridge District Court because the premises are located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts and because this matter arises out of a landlord-tenant relationship occurring within this judicial district.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Beginning approximately October 1, 2025 (two months prior to the date of this Complaint), Defendant began or permitted substantial renovation and construction work to be performed in the residential unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s unit.

6. The construction activity has produced sustained and repeated noise—drilling, hammering, sawing, and loud worker activity—during daytime hours, typically occurring between about 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.

7. The noise and other effects of the renovation substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. Plaintiff regularly works from home and the construction noise has materially impaired Plaintiff’s ability to concentrate and to conduct work-related telephone and video calls. The intrusions are frequent and substantial, not occasional or trivial.

8. In addition to the noise, construction dust from the adjacent unit has entered Plaintiff’s unit through venting and other means, causing additional interference and inconvenience.

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff in advance that renovation work would occur and the workers have generally kept weekday hours, but the work has continued consistently for two months and Defendant has indicated the work may continue for an additional one to two months.

10. Defendant offered Plaintiff a one-time rent reduction of approximately $100 for one month as compensation for the disruption. Plaintiff considers that reduction inadequate to compensate for the substantial and continuing interference.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and the ongoing construction on the neighboring unit that Defendant controls or has permitted, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss of the full benefit of the leasehold, annoyance, discomfort, and economic damages. Plaintiff estimates damages in the amount of $800.00 for loss of enjoyment, inconvenience, and partial deprivation of the leased premises’ use.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. Under Massachusetts law, every lease that conveys a possessory interest in residential premises contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by which a landlord must not substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. The covenant is breached when the landlord’s actions or those the landlord permits substantially and unreasonably interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of the property.

14. Defendant, as owner and landlord, has the power and responsibility to control activities in the building and to prevent or reasonably limit substantial interferences with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises. By permitting, allowing, and/or undertaking the ongoing renovation and construction that caused repeated and substantial noise and dust infiltration, and by failing to abate or reasonably mitigate the interference (beyond offering a nominal one-month $100 rent reduction), Defendant has breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

15. The interference described above—sustained daytime drilling, hammering, loud worker activity, and dust ingress—was substantial in degree and duration and not merely isolated or trivial, and it materially impaired Plaintiff’s use of the premises as a home and workplace.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to loss of the full benefit of the leasehold, inconvenience, impairment of the use of the premises for work, emotional distress, and related losses in an amount to be proven at trial but presently estimated at $800.00.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

A. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $800.00, to compensate Plaintiff for damages proximately caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Award Plaintiff costs of this action;

D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

PLAINTIFF HEREBY DEMANDS TRIAL BY JURY ON ALL ISSUES SO TRIABLE.
