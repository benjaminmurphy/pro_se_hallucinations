COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Connors, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Connors is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at all times relevant hereto resided at 123 Elm Street, Apartment [third floor], Lynn, MA 01905.

2. Defendant Lynn Apartment Management (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Landlord”) is a Massachusetts business entity that owns, manages, operates, and/or controls the residential apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, and at all times relevant had control and responsibility for maintenance of the common areas and safety devices in said building.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on October 5, 2023 at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Lynn District Court because the cause of action arose in Lynn, Massachusetts and the amount claimed (as to damages claimed in this Complaint) is within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if set forth fully herein.

6. Defendant owed a duty to keep the common areas of the apartment building in a reasonably safe condition, including the duty to provide and maintain working smoke detection systems in the common hallways and to warn tenants of dangerous conditions affecting tenant safety.

7. For months prior to October 5, 2023, the smoke detector located in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s third-floor unit repeatedly emitted a low-battery “chirping” signal.

8. At some point prior to October 5, 2023, someone removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector and left the battery on a windowsill; as a result, the hallway smoke detector was inoperable and incapable of producing an audible alarm.

9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the malfunctioning/chirping smoke detector on at least three (3) separate occasions and repeatedly requested that Defendant replace the battery or otherwise repair the detector so it would function properly.

10. On each such occasion Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that Defendant would “take care of it,” but Defendant failed to replace the battery or otherwise ensure the detector was in working order.

11. On October 5, 2023 a fire began in a first-floor apartment—apparently originating in the kitchen of that unit. Because the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was inoperable and without battery, no working hallway alarm activated to warn upstairs tenants, including Plaintiff.

12. Plaintiff smelled smoke and, upon attempting to evacuate, encountered a hallway thick with smoke. Plaintiff experienced acute difficulty breathing during escape and thereafter was transported to a hospital and admitted with smoke inhalation.

13. Plaintiff spent the night in the hospital receiving treatment for smoke inhalation. Plaintiff incurred approximately $12,000.00 in medical bills as a result of the smoke inhalation and related treatment and suffered lost wages of approximately $2,500.00 as a direct consequence of the injury.

14. Plaintiff’s personal property and belongings also suffered smoke and water damage during and after the incident causing additional damages to Plaintiff (the full extent and amount of which are continuing and subject to further documentation and proof).

15. Defendant’s failure to ensure the hallway smoke detector was maintained in good working order, to replace the battery, and to otherwise take reasonable steps to warn and protect tenants from a foreseeable fire hazard was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if set forth fully herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law and applicable regulations Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises and common areas in a reasonably safe condition, including maintaining required safety devices such as smoke detectors and taking reasonable steps to warn tenants of dangerous conditions (duty).

18. Defendant breached that duty by failing to keep the hallway smoke detector in working order, failing to replace the battery despite repeated notice from Plaintiff that the detector was chirping and in need of service, and failing to take reasonable corrective action to abate the dangerous condition.

19. Defendant’s breach was negligent in that it created an unreasonable risk of harm to tenants who would reasonably rely on functioning smoke detection to provide timely warning in the event of a fire.

20. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the fire-related harm to Plaintiff because, but for Defendant’s failure to maintain the hallway detector, Plaintiff would have received timely warning, and could have evacuated sooner and/or avoided or lessened the injuries and losses she sustained.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury (smoke inhalation), mental anguish, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage.

22. Plaintiff’s damages to date include approximately $12,000.00 in medical expenses and approximately $2,500.00 in lost earnings; Plaintiff also seeks compensation for past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, property damage, consequential losses, and other general and special damages to be proven at trial.
