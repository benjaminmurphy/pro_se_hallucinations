v.                                                   Civil Action No. ___________

HomeGoods Discount Store,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jason Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an individual and a resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store ("Defendant") is a retail entity doing business at and operating the premises located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the "Store").

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because the damages sought arise from personal injuries that occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Lowell District Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred at the Store located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and Defendant does business in Lowell. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223 (venue provisions for District Court divisions) and Mass. R. Civ. P. Rules governing venue.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 15, 2023, at approximately [time], Plaintiff was lawfully on the Store premises at 45 Market Street, Lowell, MA, browsing kitchen goods.

6. The Store displayed and stored heavy boxed appliances on shelving in the kitchen-ware aisle. The boxes were stacked approximately five to six boxes high on the shelving. The stacked boxes were not secured with straps, barriers, or any other protective devices, and no warning signs were posted in the aisle warning customers of the risk posed by high, unsecured stacked merchandise.

7. Another customer passed down the aisle pushing a shopping cart. The customer's cart bumped one of the lower shelves in a manner that was ordinary and not forceful beyond normal customer activity.

8. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's failure to properly secure heavy merchandise on shelving, a large boxed toaster oven dislodged from a high shelf and fell from near the top of the stack. The box struck Plaintiff on the left shoulder and on the left side of his head.

9. Plaintiff felt immediate dizziness and a severe headache after being struck. A store manager came to the scene, inspected the area, filled out an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon as a gesture of assistance. No adequate medical care was provided by the Store, nor did the manager offer more than the coupon.

10. Later that evening Plaintiff's symptoms worsened, and he presented to the Emergency Department. He was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain. Plaintiff underwent treatment and incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500.

11. As a result of his injuries, Plaintiff, who earns income as a delivery driver, lost approximately $1,200 in wages because he was unable to work immediately following the incident. Plaintiff was also unable to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month.

12. Plaintiff continues to experience effects from the concussion and shoulder strain, including headaches, dizziness, decreased range of motion of the shoulder, and associated limitations in daily activities and work.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage and display of merchandise on its premises, and to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition for customers lawfully on the premises. This duty included, among other things, a duty to secure heavy boxes stacked at height, to prevent foreseeable hazards from dislodging and falling, to warn customers of dangerous conditions that Defendant knew or should have known about, and to otherwise take reasonable measures to prevent injury to invitees. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (liability for physical harm caused by the failure to exercise reasonable care in the management of a dangerous condition on land).

15. Defendant breached the duty of care by negligently stacking and maintaining heavy boxed merchandise at unsafe heights without securing the boxes or installing barriers or other safeguards; failing to inspect the shelving or the stacked boxes with reasonable frequency and care; failing to warn customers of the foreseeable risk of falling boxes; and otherwise failing to adopt and maintain reasonable safety practices for the display and storage of heavy merchandise.

16. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that stacking heavy boxed appliances five or six boxes high without straps, restraints, or barriers created a foreseeable risk of objects falling and causing serious bodily injury to customers.

17. Defendant's breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the toaster-oven box falling and striking Plaintiff on September 15, 2023.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries (mild concussion and shoulder strain), incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500, lost approximately $1,200 in earnings, suffered pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life (including the inability to play in his weekly soccer league for about a month), and other damages to be proven at trial.

19. Defendant's conduct was negligent and careless, and Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, past and future pain and suffering, and any other damages permitted by law.

APPLICABLE LAW (Authority and Legal Principles)

20. Plaintiff pleads the foregoing causes of action under the common-law principles of negligence recognized in Massachusetts, and consistent with the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (liability for dangerous conditions or activities on land), as well as Massachusetts rules of civil procedure applicable to pleadings (Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), Rule 10).

21. Plaintiff asserts that venue, notice, and pleading requirements are satisfied under the Massachusetts General Laws and the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to civil litigation in the District Court.

22. Plaintiff further relies on the doctrines and authorities recognizing a storekeeper's duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of invitees and customers, and that liability may be imposed for foreseeable hazards proximately causing injuries to customers when such hazards result from the proprietor's failure to exercise reasonable care. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A, 339; see also Massachusetts decisions interpreting and applying similar negligence and premises-liability principles (collectively, the "Authorities").

DAMAGES

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence as alleged herein, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages, including:

    a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500 (past and continuing, to be further quantified at trial);
    b. Past lost earnings of approximately $1,200 and any future lost earnings determined to be recoverable;
    c. Past and future pain and suffering, physical impairment, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages;
    d. Costs of suit and interest as allowed by law; and
    e. Any additional economic and non-economic damages proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Awarding interest, costs of suit, and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper; and

C. Granting any other relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled under the law.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,

Date: December 1, 2025
