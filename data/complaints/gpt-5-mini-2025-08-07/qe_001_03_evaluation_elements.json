  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a residential tenancy: Plaintiff rents a two\u2011bedroom apartment at 123 Ashmont Street, pays $1,800/month, and entered a tenancy beginning June 1, 2022 (see \u00b6\u00b61.2\u20131.3, 3.1). These facts sufficiently plead a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges repeated failures by the landlord to provide adequate heat, only two limited repair visits, characterization of the boiler as \"old but functional,\" and a failure to timely or adequately remedy the condition (see \u00b6\u00b62.1, 3.2\u20133.4, 3.7, 4.3). Those factual allegations state an act/omission by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Plaintiff alleges recurring heat deficiencies (temperatures dropping to ~60\u00b0F for hours), inability to rely on habitable heating, forced use of space heaters, increased electric bills, impaired use/enjoyment of the premises, and resulting illness and missed work (see \u00b6\u00b63.2, 3.4\u20133.6, 3.8). Those allegations sufficiently describe a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the landlord had notice of inadequate heat, attempted limited repairs that failed to cure the problem, and continued omission led to recurring inadequate heat; Plaintiff ties the persistent cold to her harms (including a physician\u2019s statement that cold likely exacerbated bronchitis) (see \u00b6\u00b63.3\u20133.4, 3.6, 3.7, 4.3). These facts adequately allege causation at the pleading stage."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint itemizes out\u2011of\u2011pocket damages (approx. $150/month increased electric bills; estimated $450 for three months), medical expenses (~$100), lost wages (~$50), and general discomfort, and seeks $600 in compensatory damages (see \u00b6\u00b65.1\u20135.2). These allegations sufficiently plead damages."
