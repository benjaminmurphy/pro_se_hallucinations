COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Johnson”) is an individual residing in Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Whole Foods Market (“Defendant” or “Whole Foods”) is a corporation doing business in Massachusetts and at all relevant times owned, operated, managed, controlled, and maintained the Whole Foods grocery store located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143 (the “Premises”).
1.3 The occurrence giving rise to this action occurred on September 16, 2023, at the Whole Foods store located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.
1.4 Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Somerville District Court because the Defendant’s Premises are located in Somerville, the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Somerville, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.
1.5 This action is timely. The statute of limitations for personal injury actions in Massachusetts is three years from the date of the injury (see M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A), and Plaintiff brings this case within that time.

2. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
2.1 On Saturday, September 16, 2023, at approximately mid‑afternoon, Plaintiff was an invitee lawfully on the Premises for the purpose of shopping.
2.2 While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a substantial puddle of spilled milk. The spill was large enough that cart tracks were visible through it.
2.3 There were no warning signs, cones, barricades, or other warnings or barriers in the dairy aisle or nearby to alert customers to the hazard.
2.4 An employee of Defendant was present in the general vicinity, stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the puddle. After Plaintiff fell, that employee approached and stated that he had “noticed the spill a few minutes ago” but had been “finishing up what he was doing before [he was] going to get the mop.”
2.5 Plaintiff fell hard on her hip. At the time she finished her shopping and left the store believing she was not badly injured.
2.6 That night her hip pain increased. On September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical attention at an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed with a hip sprain requiring physical therapy. Plaintiff subsequently completed a course of physical therapy as directed by her treating clinicians.
2.7 As a result of the injury, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,000 and lost wages of approximately $1,500 due to missed shifts at her place of employment (a café).
2.8 Plaintiff’s injuries, pain, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages were proximately caused by the negligence of Defendant, as more fully alleged below.

3. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (SOLE CLAIM)
3.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1.1 through 2.8 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 Under Massachusetts law, the owner or occupier of land owes a duty to invitees to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of known or reasonably discoverable dangerous conditions (see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; see also Massachusetts authorities recognizing premise-possessor duties to invitees).
3.3 Defendant, as the owner and/or occupier of the Premises, owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the Premises in a safe condition, to reasonably inspect for hazards, to warn of hazardous conditions of which it knew or should have known, and to take reasonable corrective action or post warnings when necessary.
3.4 Defendant breached its duty of care to Plaintiff in one or more of the following respects, each of which was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages:
   a. Failing to keep the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for its invitees by allowing a large puddle of spilled milk to remain in the dairy aisle;
   b. Failing to conduct reasonable and timely inspections of the dairy aisle and other areas of the Premises to discover and remediate hazards such as spills;
   c. Failing to post warning signs, barricades, cones, or other warnings to inform customers of the spill that was present and observable;
   d. Failing to timely mop, clean up, or otherwise correct the spill after it had been noticed by an employee;
   e. Failing to adopt or follow reasonable policies, procedures, supervision, and training concerning the prompt remediation of spills and hazards in customer aisles;
   f. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.
3.5 Defendant’s breaches were negligent and foreseeably created an unreasonable risk of harm to invitees, including Ms. Johnson.
3.6 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury (hip sprain), related pain and suffering, disability, emotional distress, medical expenses of approximately $2,000, lost wages of approximately $1,500, and other damages to be proven at trial.
3.7 All conditions precedent to bringing this action have been satisfied or waived.

4. DAMAGES AND RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson demands judgment against Defendant Whole Foods Market as follows:
   a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial but not less than $3,500 for medical expenses and lost wages, and for pain, suffering, disability, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other damages permitted by law;
   b. Costs and disbursements of this action;
   c. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as allowed by law;
   d. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

5. LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Representative)
Plaintiff asserts this cause of action under the negligence principles applicable in Massachusetts. Representative legal authorities governing duty, breach, causation, and damages in premises liability and negligence cases include, without limitation:
   - Massachusetts General Laws c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury).
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land to invitees).
   - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (condition on land involving risk to invitees).
   - Cases interpreting premises possessor duties and negligence principles in Massachusetts (representative authorities include decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and Massachusetts Appeals Court regarding duty to invitees, reasonable care, notice, and causation). Plaintiff will rely upon such Massachusetts caselaw and other authorities as appropriate at trial and in support of motions.

(Note: Plaintiff is proceeding pro se and requests that the Court and Defendant take notice of and apply applicable Massachusetts statutes and controlling case law regarding negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff will rely on and cite pertinent Massachusetts cases and statutory authority during pretrial proceedings and at trial.)

6. JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
