    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant is owner of the building and \"the person legally responsible for maintenance of the sidewalk\" (\u00b62), and expressly pleads the landowner duty to maintain and warn of dangerous conditions (\u00b613\u201314). These factual allegations sufficiently plead that Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant cleared only a narrow path, failed to apply salt/sand/other de-icers, failed to create an adequate non\u2011slippery passage, and ignored tenant warnings (\u00b66\u20138, \u00b615), which are factual allegations supporting a breach of the asserted duty."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff stepped on the icy patch created by melting/refreezing and slipped and fell (\u00b67, \u00b69) and that the injuries were caused by the dangerous sidewalk condition and Defendant\u2019s negligent failure to make it safe (\u00b611, \u00b616). Those allegations sufficiently plead but\u2011for causation (the fall and resulting injuries would not have occurred but for the icy condition Defendant failed to remediate)."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the icy, slippery condition was the direct cause of the fall (\u00b69, \u00b611) and that the condition and tenant warnings made the harm foreseeable (\u00b68, \u00b616). Those facts adequately plead proximate (foreseeable) causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete damages: lower back injury, pain, limited mobility, medical treatment and expenses of approximately $2,500, and lost wages of approximately $1,000 (\u00b610, \u00b617), satisfying the damages element."
