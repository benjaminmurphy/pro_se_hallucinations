COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING SCHEDULE

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
- Plaintiff: Lisa Thompson, parent of the minor child below. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
- Defendant: Mark Johnson, parent of the minor child below.
- Minor Child: Emma Johnson, born [200?] (age 8).
- Venue and jurisdiction are appropriate in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the child currently resides in Barnstable County and the defendant has established significant contacts and residence in Barnstable County since the entry of the existing order.
- The prior custodial order concerning the minor child was entered on January 15, 2019 (the “2019 Order”).

2. Nature of the Action
- This is an action by the Plaintiff under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seeking modification of the 2019 Order, specifically to eliminate the current midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time presently allocated to the Defendant and to modify the weekend parenting time schedule to avoid long-distance overnight travel on school nights, on the ground that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the 2019 Order and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the minor child.

3. Background Facts
- The 2019 Order awarded primary physical custody of the minor child to Plaintiff and granted Defendant parenting time of every other weekend and one midweek overnight (Wednesdays).
- At the time the 2019 Order was entered, both parents lived in the same town. The logistics of the midweek overnight involved a short drive home and a child returning to school the next morning without long hours of pre-dawn travel.
- Since entry of the 2019 Order, Defendant has moved to Cape Cod (approximately 90 miles from the child’s school and primary residence).
- Despite the distance, Defendant has continued to require the Wednesday overnight under the 2019 Order. Defendant picks Emma up from school on Wednesday, transports her to Cape Cod, and returns her to school the next morning. In order to make the trip in time, the Defendant has been waking Emma around 4:30 a.m. for the return drive on Thursday mornings.
- As a result of this travel routine, Emma has been chronically fatigued on Thursdays. Plaintiff’s daughter’s teacher has reported a noticeable drop in Emma’s classroom participation, alertness, and performance on Thursdays. Emma has also reported to Plaintiff that she is sleepy and has difficulty concentrating on schoolwork after these midweek long drives.
- The long-distance midweek travel was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the 2019 Order and substantially changes the conditions under which the 2019 Order operates and impacts the child’s physical and educational welfare.
- Plaintiff has attempted to resolve this issue informally with Defendant, requesting that the midweek overnight be eliminated or that Defendant make alternative arrangements that do not require Emma to endure multi-hour pre-dawn car trips on school mornings. Defendant has declined to agree to any modification and insists on continuing the Wednesday overnight pursuant to the 2019 Order.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
- There has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 Order. The Defendant’s relocation to Cape Cod (a substantial increase in distance between the child’s home and the Defendant’s residence) has created new and substantial burdens on the child’s health, rest, and school functioning which were not present at the time of the original order.
- The change is of the type recognized by Massachusetts law as warranting modification where it adversely affects the child’s welfare and the practical operation of the existing parenting plan.

5. Best Interests of the Child
- The best interests of the child require elimination of midweek overnight parenting time that produces chronic sleep deprivation and negatively affects school performance.
- The requested modification (elimination of the Wednesday overnight and adjustment of weekend parenting time to avoid school-night long-distance travel) will better protect the child’s physical and educational welfare and will allow continued meaningful contact with the Defendant on a schedule that does not impair the child’s school functioning.

6. Relief Requested
Plaintiff requests that this Court enter an order:
a. Finding that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2019 Order and that modification of the custody/parenting plan is warranted;
b. Modifying the 2019 Order to eliminate the midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time currently allocated to the Defendant;
c. Modifying the weekend parenting time schedule so as to avoid multi-hour overnight travel on school nights (for example, by replacing the Wednesday overnight with extended alternating weekend time, or by creating a schedule requiring pick-up and drop-off times and locations that avoid child travel on school nights) — or in the alternative, by entering such other schedule as the Court finds to be in Emma’s best interests;
d. Granting such temporary orders as may be necessary pending final hearing, including, if appropriate, temporarily suspending Defendant’s Wednesday overnight pending the Court’s determination;
e. Granting the Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including allocation of costs and any reasonable temporary or one-time adjustments necessary to effectuate the modified schedule.

7. Legal Basis (authorities establishing standards for modification)
- Plaintiff relies upon and invokes the statutes and decisional law governing modification of custody/parenting orders in Massachusetts, including but not limited to: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208 (pertaining to divorce, custody, and modification), the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, and the governing standards that modifications of custody/parenting plans require a showing of a material change in circumstances and that modifications be made in the best interests of the child.
- Applicable Massachusetts authorities on modification and the best-interests standard include, by way of example and not limitation:
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutory provisions relating to custody and modification in divorce and family proceedings);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Massachusetts UCCJEA) (jurisdictional rules for child custody proceedings);
   - See, e.g., decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court holding that a material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child are required to modify existing custody or visitation orders (see, e.g., cases applying the material-change/best-interests framework and detailed factual inquiry into children’s welfare and educational needs);
   - Authorities addressing relocation, substantial change in logistics or parental residence, and the court’s balancing test in modifying parenting time to protect a child’s health and school functioning (see, e.g., Massachusetts caselaw regarding parental relocation, modification of visitation where child’s welfare is adversely affected, and the Court’s broad discretion to alter parenting schedules to protect educational interests);
   - Rules and practice provisions of the Probate and Family Court governing motions to modify custody, temporary relief, and notice requirements.
- (Plaintiff will rely on full citations to controlling Massachusetts statutes and cases at hearing and in any supporting memorandum of law filed with the Court.)

8. Temporary Relief Requested
- Plaintiff requests that the Court consider, on an ex parte or expedited temporary basis if warranted by the facts shown and the Court’s rules, an order temporarily suspending the Defendant’s Wednesday overnight pending hearing on the merits and adopting an interim parenting schedule that prevents Emma from undertaking long-distance school-night travel (e.g., restricting overnight travel that requires Emma to be awakened pre-dawn for school-day travel).

9. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
a. Modify the 2019 Order as requested above (eliminating the Wednesday overnight and adjusting weekend parenting time to avoid multi-hour school-night travel), finding that a material change in circumstances has occurred and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the minor child;
b. Provide such temporary relief as the Court deems necessary pending final hearing, including temporary suspension of the Defendant’s Wednesday overnight if appropriate;
c. Award Plaintiff any other relief that the Court finds equitable and in the best interest of the child; and
d. Grant such costs and attorney’s fees as the Court may allow (if sought at hearing).

10. Certificate of Service
- Plaintiff will serve a copy of this Complaint and any temporary relief application on Defendant by personal service or such other method as permitted by the Probate and Family Court rules and will file proof of such service with the Court.

Notes and Next Steps (for the Court file and Plaintiff)
- Plaintiff should file this Complaint with the Barnstable Probate and Family Court, submit any required filing fee or fee waiver application, complete and file any required local forms for modification motions, and, if requesting emergency temporary relief, file a supporting affidavit describing the urgency and facts supporting temporary suspension of the Wednesday overnight.
- At or before hearing Plaintiff may file a supporting memorandum of law providing statutory and case authority with complete citations. Plaintiff intends to rely on the statutory framework for custody modification, the UCCJEA as appropriate, and Massachusetts decisions holding that relocation and resulting burdens on a child (including interference with sleep and school performance) constitute material changes in circumstances warranting modification where modification is in the child’s best interests.
