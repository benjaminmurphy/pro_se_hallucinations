COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Miller ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Sarah Thompson ("Defendant" or "Landlord"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852. Plaintiff can be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Sarah Thompson is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy for the apartment at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, MA that began on February 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $1,200.00 per month in rent.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Lowell District Court because the premises and acts complained of are located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the amount sought is within this Court’s jurisdictional limits.

5. Venue is proper in this Court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 2 and related venue statutes because the cause of action arose in Lowell and the defendant’s property is located in Lowell.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Beginning in or about mid-2025, Plaintiff observed mold growth in the bathroom of the rental unit, initially appearing in the corner of the shower and thereafter spreading to the bathroom ceiling.

7. The bathroom is interior and has no operable window; the only ventilation is an exhaust fan that vents the bathroom.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold conditions and requested remediation and corrective repair, including investigation of ventilation and remediation of mold.

9. Defendant inspected the premises in response to Plaintiff’s report. At that time Defendant acknowledged the presence of mold but attributed the condition to Plaintiff’s habits — alleging that Plaintiff does not run the exhaust fan “enough” and that Plaintiff takes showers that are “too hot and too long.” Defendant refused to undertake any corrective work to the ventilation system or to investigate possible building-related causes, stating that she would “clean” the visible mold but would not address ventilation or other repairs because Defendant asserted Plaintiff caused the problem.

10. Plaintiff routinely uses the bathroom exhaust fan when showering, though Plaintiff may not have used it on every single occasion. Plaintiff’s showering habits are typical and not excessive. The bathroom’s lack of a window makes the exhaust fan the primary, and practically only, means of ventilation.

11. Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced new and ongoing respiratory symptoms including coughing, nasal congestion, and wheezing. These respiratory problems are new to Plaintiff and have been documented by Plaintiff’s treating physician, who has advised Plaintiff that the symptoms are likely related to the mold exposure and recommended remediation.

12. As a result of the mold presence, Plaintiff discarded a shower curtain and several towels which developed mold contamination, totaling approximately $60.00 in personal property loss.

13. Defendant’s refusal to repair the ventilation or otherwise take reasonable steps to remediate the underlying cause of the mold has allowed the mold condition to persist and to interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

14. Plaintiff has been required to live with diminished habitability of the premises, and Defendant’s conduct has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the apartment.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, every tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and to a dwelling reasonably fit for human habitation. A landlord’s wrongful act or omission that substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including failure to remediate conditions that affect habitability or materially impair health and safety, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and tenant protections as to housing conditions); see also applicable Massachusetts authority recognizing landlord obligations to provide premises fit for habitation and to remedy conditions that impair tenants’ use and enjoyment.

17. The Massachusetts Sanitary Code and related public-health laws set minimum standards for fitness for human habitation and require landlords to maintain premises free from conditions hazardous to health, such as mold and inadequate ventilation. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) and applicable provisions of M.G.L. c. 111 (public health). Under these authorities, landlords have an obligation to maintain essential services and to remedy conditions that create health hazards.

18. Under M.G.L. c. 186 and related landlord-tenant law, landlords have duties to keep premises in habitable condition and to refrain from conduct that unjustifiably interferes with tenants’ rights to possession and use. See M.G.L. c. 186 and relevant case law interpreting landlord duties and tenant remedies for interference with possession and habitability.

19. Defendant’s conduct — including acknowledging mold, promising only to “clean” visible mold but refusing to investigate or remediate the underlying cause (including ventilation), and attributing the problem solely to Plaintiff’s behavior without a reasonable investigation — constituted a failure to take reasonable steps to correct a condition that materially and adversely affected the habitability of the premises.

20. Defendant’s failure to reasonably remediate and to address the ventilation deficiency has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises and has caused Plaintiff to suffer inconvenience, damage to personal property, physical injury in the form of respiratory illness, emotional distress, and other damages.

21. Plaintiff provided Defendant with notice of the mold condition and an opportunity to cure. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to undertake reasonable corrective measures to eliminate the hazardous condition and to restore the premises to a habitable condition.

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered economic damages (including loss of personal property, medical expenses, and diminution in the value of the tenancy) and non-economic damages (including pain and suffering and loss of use and enjoyment). Plaintiff estimates total compensatory damages in the amount of approximately $200.00 based on current out-of-pocket losses and reduced habitability; Plaintiff reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF — LEGAL AUTHORITIES (Representative Authorities)

The following statutes, regulations, and decisions illustrate applicable legal authorities concerning landlords’ duties, habitability, and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff relies on these authorities, among others, to support her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment:

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (statutory provisions governing landlord-tenant rights and remedies).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health) and related sections addressing nuisances and public health hazards.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection statute) (general consumer protections; reserved for potential ancillary claims).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- 105 CMR 410.400 (provisions addressing sanitation and ventilation in dwelling units) (and related subsections).
- Local public health codes and regulations applicable in Lowell and Middlesex County.

Representative Case Law (authority for implied warranty/covenant and landlord duties)
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies).
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (illustrative authority on landlord obligation to repair and warranty of habitability).
- Additional Massachusetts and federal decisions have recognized landlords’ obligations to provide safe, habitable premises and that material interference with habitability and use may constitute breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (see, e.g., cases addressing mold, hazardous conditions, and ventilation-related habitability claims).

(Notes: Plaintiff cites the foregoing statutes, regulations, and case law for illustrative and supporting purposes. Plaintiff reserves the right to cite additional controlling Massachusetts decisions and authorities at trial or in amended pleadings as necessary. Plaintiff will rely upon Massachusetts statutory law (including M.G.L. c. 186 and c. 111), the Massachusetts Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000), and relevant Massachusetts caselaw interpreting landlord obligations and quiet enjoyment.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. A declaratory judgment that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and failed to maintain the premises in a habitable condition;

B. An order awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but in any event at least $200.00 for out-of-pocket losses and diminution in the value of the tenancy, together with such additional damages as proved at trial for medical expenses, property loss, and discomfort;

C. An order requiring Defendant to take immediate remedial action, including but not limited to: (i) prompt professional mold remediation of the affected areas; (ii) inspection and repair or replacement of the bathroom ventilation system to provide adequate ventilation; and (iii) any other repairs necessary to restore the premises to habitable condition and to prevent recurrence of mold;

D. Costs of suit and court filing fees;

E. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Notes and Practical Points (for Plaintiff’s use in prosecuting this Complaint)
- Preserve documentation: keep records of all notices to the Landlord, photographs of mold, medical records, receipts for discarded items, and any communications from the Landlord (text, email, letters).
- If possible, obtain an independent mold inspection or professional opinion regarding cause and extent of mold contamination; retain copies of any repair or remediation estimates.
- If Plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint or add statutory claims (e.g., under M.G.L. ch. 93A or other statutory landlord-tenant remedies), Plaintiff may do so consistent with court rules and applicable statutes of limitation.
- Plaintiff should update the court and opposing counsel with any change of address or contact information.
