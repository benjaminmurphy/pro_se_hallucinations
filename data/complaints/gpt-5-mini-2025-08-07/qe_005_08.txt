Michael Richards
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Thompson, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Richards, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident tenant of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02144.
2. Defendant Michael Richards ("Defendant") is the sole landlord and owner of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144 and is a resident of Massachusetts.
3. Plaintiff entered into a lease for Unit 2 at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA with Defendant; the tenancy began on May 1, 2022.
4. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,800.00 to Defendant.
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law because the real property and the parties are located in Somerville and the acts complained of occurred in Somerville. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186 and M.G.L. c. 239 (summary process and venue provisions) and the general venue statutes applicable to housing and landlord-tenant actions.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6. Plaintiff occupies Unit 2 on the second floor of a triple-decker building at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA. The building is owned and managed by Defendant.
7. Approximately six months ago the tenants of Unit 3 (the unit directly above Plaintiff) moved in. Since that time, the occupants of the unit above Plaintiff have created excessive and unreasonable noise in the form of late-night loud music, frequent stomping and pounding, and noises consistent with moving heavy furniture at late hours (including well past midnight).
8. The noise is frequent and recurring and has occurred at all hours of the day and night. The most severe noise has occurred during nighttime hours that reasonably would be expected to be used for sleeping.
9. Plaintiff has personally requested that the upstairs tenants reduce the noise on multiple occasions. The upstairs tenants complied for approximately one week but then resumed the excessive noise.
10. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant (his landlord) approximately five to six times about the ongoing noise problems. On at least one occasion Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants but thereafter told Plaintiff that he "can't control how people live."
11. Defendant has failed to take effective remedial action to abate the ongoing excessive noise from the upstairs unit, despite Plaintiff’s repeated reports and despite the fact that the lease expressly provides Plaintiff the right to "quiet enjoyment" of the leased premises.
12. As a direct and proximate result of the ongoing excessive noise and Defendant’s failure to reasonably abate it, Plaintiff has suffered a significant and continuing interference with the use and enjoyment of his leased premises and his right to normal residential sleep and repose.
13. Plaintiff has on average been able to obtain only four to five hours of sleep per night since the onset of the disturbance. As a result, Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at his desk. Plaintiff’s treating physician has prescribed a sleep medication; Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket cost for the medication is approximately $40.00 per month.
14. Plaintiff has incurred other expenditures to attempt to mitigate the noise, including earplugs and a white-noise machine, and has rearranged his bedroom; nevertheless, the interference has continued and has not been effectively remedied.
15. Plaintiff estimates his compensable damages arising from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment, out-of-pocket expenses for sleep medication, medical and work-related consequences, and other tangible losses) to be approximately $3,600.00. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this amount upward as additional proof is obtained and to seek recovery of any and all permitted damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law) — Against Defendant
16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–15 as if fully set forth herein.
17. Under Massachusetts common law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is included in every residential lease, whether written or oral, and guarantees that a tenant may peacefully and quietly enjoy the leased premises free from substantial interference by the landlord or by others for whose conduct the landlord is responsible. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1 (1977); Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071, 1074–75 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing relationships between habitability, quiet enjoyment, and landlord obligation to control conditions of the premises and co-tenants); see also Massachusetts caselaw recognizing landlord obligations to abate substantial interferences with tenants’ possession and use by reason of other tenants or conditions within landlord’s control.
18. The landlord’s duties include exercising reasonable care and taking reasonable steps to prevent or abate substantial intrusions on a tenant’s quiet enjoyment caused by other tenants or occupants when the landlord has actual knowledge of the problem and the power to remedy it. See, e.g., cases recognizing landlord responsibility where landlord knew of disturbances and failed to take effective action (see, e.g., Javins, supra; cited Massachusetts authorities recognizing the landlord’s duty to control nuisances at premises under landlord control).
19. Defendant, as the owner and landlord of 123 Elm Street, had actual notice of the noise disturbances and of Plaintiff’s complaints and therefore had the duty to take reasonable steps to abate the ongoing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.
20. Defendant’s response — including acknowledging complaints but refusing to take remedial measures beyond a single conversation and stating he "can't control how people live" — was unreasonable and inadequate under the circumstances to abate the continuous substantial interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.
21. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to abate the noise substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:
    a. Actual monetary losses, including out-of-pocket expenses for sleep medication ($40/month) and other mitigation measures (earplugs, white-noise machine);
    b. Diminution in the benefit of Plaintiff’s bargain of the lease (reduced use and enjoyment of the premises);
    c. Emotional distress, loss of sleep, and related harms, including work-related penalties (written warning at work);
    d. Such other compensatory damages as may be proven at trial.
23. Plaintiff seeks all damages permitted at law, including compensatory damages, costs, pre- and post-judgment interest, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITY
24. Plaintiff invokes and relies on Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and common law principles governing the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. Relevant statutory authorities include, without limitation, M.G.L. c. 186 (general landlord-tenant law), M.G.L. c. 239 (summary process provisions related to possession and enforcement), and M.G.L. c. 93A (unfair or deceptive practices where applicable). Plaintiff also relies on the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized and applied in landlord-tenant jurisprudence and secondary authorities such as the Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant.
25. Plaintiff cites the following illustrative authorities (non-exhaustive) bearing on the liability of landlords for interference with quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s obligation to take reasonable steps to abate nuisances and disturbances for which the landlord has notice and control:
    - Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 5.1–5.2 (1977) (quiet enjoyment).
    - Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing landlord obligations in urban residential settings and the relationship between habitability/quiet enjoyment and landlord duties).
    - M.G.L. c. 186 (Mass. Gen. Laws, landlord-tenant statutes).
    - M.G.L. c. 239 (summary process and related procedures).
    - M.G.L. c. 93A (consumer protection statute) — as potentially relevant to systemic landlord practices that may constitute unfair or deceptive business practices in certain factual circumstances.
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821D (private nuisance principles, as applied analogously to leasehold disputes).
    - Massachusetts caselaw recognizing landlord duties with respect to co-tenant or neighbor disturbances and the right to seek damages for breach of quiet enjoyment (see, e.g., SJC and Superior Court decisions discussing landlord liability for disturbances and nuisance conditions; see also decisions applying Javins and quiet enjoyment principles in Massachusetts and analogous jurisdictions).
    - Cases and authorities addressing damages and remedies for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in landlord-tenant disputes (including awards for diminution of value, out-of-pocket expenses, and consequential damages where disturbance was substantial and landlord failed to remedy after notice).
    - Authorities addressing the tenant’s right to abatement, damages, and other relief where landlord fails to remedy substantial disturbances (see illustrative decisions in Massachusetts and persuasive federal decisions).
    - Scholarly and practitioner authorities on landlord obligations to control nuisances and ensure tenants’ peaceful enjoyment of leased premises.
    - Any other Massachusetts statutes or decisional law applicable to landlord responsibility for housing conditions and co-tenant disturbances that the Court deems relevant.

( Plaintiff intends to rely on the foregoing authorities and will cite additional specific Massachusetts case law and statutory provisions in support of the claim as appropriate in pleadings, motions, and at trial. )

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and award the following relief:
A. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including the presently estimated sum of $3,600.00 and such additional damages as the Court finds just and proper;
B. Recovery of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Plaintiff to mitigate the disturbance (including but not limited to sleep medication, earplugs, white-noise machine);
C. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
D. Costs of this action, including filing fees and allowable costs;
E. Any other relief the Court deems just, equitable, and proper, including injunctive relief ordering Defendant to take reasonable measures to abate the noise and ensure Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises; and

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
