However, the opinion does not frame the heating problem as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nor does it analyze landlord liability under that covenant. The controlling doctrinal hook here is the warranty of habitability, not quiet enjoyment, so the case does not support the specific proposition as worded.",

This implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that \u2018bare living requirements\u2019 must be maintained. In the instant case\u2026[defects included]\u2026lack of heat in four rooms\u2026 If the trial court does find a breach of implied warranty, the court must then determine the extent of the damages flowing from this breach.\u201d"

It does not address heating, building code heat requirements, or the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nor does it discuss recurrent interference with heat as a breach. The opinion\u2019s contractual discussion refers to security measures, not habitability via heat, so using Kline as authority for a heat/quiet-enjoyment proposition misstates its holding and reasoning.",

The court discusses heat only as one of several essential services encompassed by that warranty and addresses landlord liability and damages in contract terms, expressly displacing constructive eviction/quiet enjoyment doctrine rather than grounding relief in it. Thus, it supports liability and damages for lack of heat under an implied warranty of habitability, not under the covenant of quiet enjoyment as the proposition states.",

While the facts of the case concern garbage, vermin, and sanitation during a strike rather than heat, the court\u2019s general statement of the standard supports the proposition that recurring, substantial deficiencies in essential services (including inadequate heat during the heating season) that significantly impair habitability or comfort can constitute material interference. Thus, the case provides direct doctrinal support for the proposition\u2019s principle regarding material interference and inadequate heat.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cA residential lease is essentially a sale of shelter and necessarily encompasses those services which render the premises suitable for the purpose for which they are leased\u2026 he does warrant, however, that there are no conditions that materially affect the health and safety of tenants. For example, no one will dispute that health and safety are adversely affected by insect or rodent infestation, **insufficient heat and plumbing facilities**, significantly dangerous electrical outlets or wiring, inadequate sanitation facilities or similar services which constitute the essence of the modern dwelling unit.\u201d"
