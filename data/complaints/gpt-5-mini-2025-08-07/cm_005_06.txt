Mark Johnson
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
   1.1. Plaintiff: Laura Johnson (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Laura”), residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant: Mark Johnson (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Mark”), residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
   1.3. The parties are the parents of the following minor children:
        - Emma Johnson, born 2015 (age 10);
        - Jake Johnson, born 2017 (age 8).

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this action pursuant to the Massachusetts General Laws and the Probate and Family Court’s authority to enter and modify orders for custody and parenting time.
   2.2. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Probate and Family Court because the parties and the children reside in Middlesex County and because the existing custody order was entered in this Court.

3. Background / Existing Order
   3.1. On June 15, 2021, this Court entered an order concerning custody of Emma and Jake (the “Existing Order”). The Existing Order provides that the parties share legal custody, that the children primarily reside with Plaintiff, and that Defendant has a regular visitation schedule with the children.
   3.2. The Existing Order further directs the parties to support the children’s relationship with each parent and not to disparage the other parent in the children’s presence.

4. Nature of the Action
   4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts authority governing modification of custody and parental rights, and for the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff seeks a modification of the Existing Order to: (a) establish primary physical custody with Plaintiff (primary residence with Laura); and (b) issue clearer standards and procedures regarding scheduling of extracurricular activities and decision-making regarding activities that conflict with the other parent’s parenting time, including an enforceable communication and scheduling protocol to prevent unilateral scheduling that interferes with the children’s time with either parent.

5. Factual Allegations Demonstrating a Material Change in Circumstances
   5.1. Over the past year (2024–2025), Defendant has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities (sports, lessons, programs) scheduled during Plaintiff’s regular parenting time without prior discussion with Plaintiff or mutual agreement.
   5.2. When Plaintiff has requested that Defendant reschedule activities or coordinate so the children do not miss activities while in Plaintiff’s care, Defendant has refused and has told the children that it is Plaintiff’s fault if they miss activities while with Plaintiff.
   5.3. The children have reported to Plaintiff that Defendant has called Plaintiff “selfish” and has told them that Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” when reasonable scheduling accommodations are requested. Such statements were made in the presence of the children and during communications with them.
   5.4. As a direct result of the foregoing conduct, one child (Jake, age 8) has developed ongoing stomach aches and physical complaints that arise on days when the children prepare to transition between homes or on days when scheduling conflicts occur.
   5.5. The conduct described above is contrary to the Existing Order’s directive that the parties support the children’s relationship with each parent and not disparage the other parent in the children’s presence, and it is interfering with the children’s emotional well-being, stability, and consistent parenting time.
   5.6. These developments constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order on June 15, 2021, warranting modification to protect the children’s best interests and to provide a clear mechanism to prevent further parental interference and disparagement.

6. Legal Standard
   6.1. It is well established in Massachusetts law that modification of custody or primary residence requires a showing that (1) there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order, and (2) a modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., cases construing the standard for modification and the best interests inquiry. (See authorities cited below.)
   6.2. Interference with parenting time, disparagement of the other parent in front of a child, and conduct that negatively affects a child’s physical or emotional health may constitute a material change in circumstances and supporting grounds for modification. (See authorities cited below.)
   6.3. The Court’s inquiry in any modification matter must focus on the best interests of the children, considering factors such as the children’s adjustment to home and community, the parents’ ability to cooperate and make decisions jointly, and any conduct by a parent that undermines the child’s relationship with the other parent or harms the child’s emotional or physical health. (See authorities cited below.)

7. Claim for Relief — Material Change in Circumstances and Best Interests
   7.1. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 6 above.
   7.2. Plaintiff alleges that since entry of the Existing Order, Defendant’s persistent unilateral scheduling of activities during Plaintiff’s parenting time, coupled with verbal disparagement of Plaintiff in front of the children and communications with the children that have caused emotional distress and somatic symptoms in the child, constitute a material change in circumstances sufficient to permit modification of the Existing Order.
   7.3. Plaintiff further alleges that modification is necessary to protect the children’s best interests: to provide stability, to stop the undermining of Plaintiff’s parenting role, to reduce transition-related anxiety manifesting as stomach aches, and to ensure fair and predictable parenting time and participation in activities.
   7.4. Plaintiff seeks modification to primary physical custody with Plaintiff because, based on the facts above, the children’s welfare and best interests will be served by primary residence with Plaintiff and by clear, enforceable rules governing scheduling of extracurricular activities and communication protocols.

8. Specific Proposed Modifications and Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   8.1. Modify the Existing Order by designating Plaintiff (Laura Johnson) as the parent with primary physical custody of Emma and Jake; Defendant (Mark Johnson) to have a parenting time schedule to be set by the Court consistent with the children’s best interests (or, alternatively, maintain the current schedule if the Court finds reasonable but with the additional restrictions requested below).
   8.2. Modify the Existing Order to include an express, enforceable scheduling provision as follows (or words to similar effect):
        a. Either parent proposing to enroll a child in any extracurricular activity that will occur during the other parent’s scheduled parenting time shall notify the other parent in writing (email acceptable) no fewer than 14 days before the activity begins and must obtain the other parent’s consent for participation that will conflict with the other parent’s scheduled time. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If consent is withheld, the proposing parent must offer a reasonable alternative scheduling arrangement for the activity so that parenting time is not interfered with.
        b. If activities cannot be rescheduled and the parents cannot agree within 7 days, the parents shall seek a conference before the assigned Probate and Family Court magistrate or a mutually agreed neutral mediator for expedited resolution.
        c. Neither parent shall, directly or indirectly, disparage the other parent to or in the presence of the children. Communications that are disparaging or that seek to alienate the children from the other parent shall be deemed a violation of the Order.
   8.3. Include language prohibiting one parent from telling the children that the other parent “doesn’t really love them,” that the other parent is “selfish,” or other similar disparaging statements; and provide that violations may be remedied by make-up parenting time or other appropriate sanctions as the Court deems just.
   8.4. Order forensic- or therapeutic-parenting interventions as the Court deems appropriate (e.g., court-ordered parenting coordination, counseling for the children to address transition anxiety), if the Court determines such measures are needed to protect the children’s best interests.
   8.5. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including but not limited to attorney’s fees and costs if appropriate.

9. Legal Authorities (Representative)
   Plaintiff relies on the following Massachusetts statutes and case law as relevant authority for modification of custody and the standards governing material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child:
   9.1. Statutes and court rules
        - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (provisions governing divorce and related matters, including custody and modification authority);
        - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (statutes pertaining to children and families);
        - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (domestic relations procedures — as applicable);
        - Mass. R. Dom. Rel. Proc. (Probate and Family Court procedural rules);
        - Rules of the Probate and Family Court and relevant standing orders concerning parenting coordination and expedited resolutions.
   9.2. Massachusetts case law (illustrative and non-exhaustive)
        - Maternal and paternal custody modification precedent recognizing the material-change/best-interest standard and parental conduct as significant: e.g., cases discussing modification standard and best interests of the child;
        - Cases addressing parental alienation, disparaging conduct in front of children, and interference with parenting time as grounds supporting modification;
        - Cases discussing the availability of remedies including changes to primary residence, parenting coordination, and make-up time or sanctions for interference.

   (Note: Plaintiff intends to rely at hearing on statutes, rule authority, and Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing modification of custody, material change of circumstances, parental alienation, interference with parenting time, and related remedial measures. Plaintiff will supply full citations and copies of the controlling authorities to the Court and opposing counsel in advance of the hearing.)

10. Prayer for Relief
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   10.1. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order on June 15, 2021;
   10.2. Modify the Existing Order to designate Plaintiff as the parent with primary physical custody of Emma and Jake;
   10.3. Enter clear, enforceable scheduling rules and a communication protocol to prevent unilateral scheduling that interferes with parenting time, including the 14-day notice and consent requirement for activities that would conflict with the other parent’s parenting time (or adopt such other rules as the Court finds appropriate);
   10.4. Enjoin Defendant from disparaging Plaintiff in the presence of the children and impose remedies for violations;
   10.5. Order parenting coordination, child counseling, or other therapeutic interventions if the Court deems them necessary to protect the children’s best interests;
   10.6. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable; and
   10.7. Award costs and attorney’s fees to Plaintiff if appropriate and as permitted by law.

Plaintiff requests a hearing on this Complaint at the Court’s earliest convenience.

Notes and Practical Considerations
- Plaintiff should file this Complaint with the Middlesex Probate and Family Court clerk and serve the Defendant in accordance with the Court’s rules for domestic relations matters.
- Plaintiff should be prepared at the first hearing to present specific examples, dates, witnesses, communications (emails/texts) and any medical or school documentation (e.g., the child’s stomach-ache complaints at school) supporting the allegations of emotional harm and scheduling conflicts.
- If available, Plaintiff should bring copies of the Existing Order (June 15, 2021), any communications showing unilateral scheduling or disparaging statements, and any records showing the child’s medical complaints tied to transitions.
- If Plaintiff wishes, she can request expedited relief or temporary orders addressing scheduling and no-disparagement pending final resolution; the Court may consider emergency or temporary relief where immediate harm to a child’s welfare is shown.
