JESSICA REED,  
    Plaintiff,

v.

MARK THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Reed is an individual residing at 67 Forest Hills Street, Apartment ___, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 or by email at psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Premises”), and may be served at the Premises or at his last known address.
1.3 This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts statutory and common law governing landlord-tenant disputes and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, which lies within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
1.4 This action is timely. Plaintiff commenced tenancy on February 1, 2023 and remains a tenant of the Premises.

2. Factual Allegations
2.1 On or about February 1, 2023, Plaintiff entered into possession of a studio apartment located at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, for which she pays monthly rent of $1,600.00.
2.2 At the showing prior to entering into tenancy, Plaintiff observed water staining on the ceiling in one area of the studio. Plaintiff asked the landlord about the stains. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were the result of an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”
2.3 Following move-in, during the first significant rainstorm after Plaintiff took possession, water began to drip through the ceiling at the same location as the pre-existing stains. Plaintiff immediately informed Defendant of the leak, notified him repeatedly of ongoing water intrusion, and requested repair.
2.4 Defendant declined to promptly and effectively remedy the leak and repeatedly characterized the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue,” and stated that Plaintiff was aware the unit had “character” when signing the lease.
2.5 Over the ensuing months the leak worsened during rainstorms. On one occasion water intrusion soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined Plaintiff’s laptop left on a coffee table. Plaintiff incurred $900.00 in replacement cost for the laptop.
2.6 Persistent moisture at the leak site has caused a musty odor in the apartment. Plaintiff has experienced headaches that she reasonably believes are related to the dampness and possible mold resulting from the unresolved leak. Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed and other belongings away from the affected area and has been effectively deprived of use of a substantial portion of the apartment.
2.7 Plaintiff has continued to pay the full monthly rent of $1,600.00 despite the partial loss of use and comfort of the Premises because she understands the need to preserve her rights under Massachusetts law. Defendant’s continued failure to remedy the water intrusion and resulting conditions constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.
2.8 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair and abate the water intrusion and associated conditions, Plaintiff has suffered damages including but not limited to: repair/replacement cost of her laptop ($900.00), diminished use and enjoyment of the apartment, emotional distress, loss of quiet enjoyment, and other consequential damages subject to proof at trial.

3. Claim — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law)
3.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1.1 through 2.8 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 Under Massachusetts common law, every residential tenancy carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment that obligates a landlord to refrain from conduct that substantially and unreasonably interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing connection between habitability and tenant remedies); see also Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (N.J. 1984) (implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies).
3.3 The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when a landlord’s actions or omissions (including failure to repair significant defects) render the premises substantially unsuitable for their intended use or substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Javins, 428 F.2d at 1086-87; Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974); see also 105 CMR 410.000 (Massachusetts Sanitary Code – Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) (establishing minimum standards for sanitary and habitable housing).
3.4 Defendant’s repeated failure to repair the water intrusion at the Premises, and his refusal to correct conditions causing property damage and likely mold and associated health effects, constitute a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and thus breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
3.5 Defendant had actual notice of the leak and the consequent harms because Plaintiff reported the condition repeatedly, and Defendant explicitly described it as a cosmetic issue rather than taking effective corrective measures.
3.6 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including the $900.00 cost to replace her ruined laptop, diminution in the use of her apartment, and other consequential damages.

4. Damages and Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court grant the following relief:
a) Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the sole cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b) Monetary damages in the amount of $900.00 for property damage (laptop) and other compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for diminution of use, discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional harm caused by Defendant’s breach;
c) Pre- and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
d) Costs of this action, including filing fees and other litigation costs;
e) Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

5. Demand for Jury Trial
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
