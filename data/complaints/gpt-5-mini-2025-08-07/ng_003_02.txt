COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is 617-555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant HomeGoods Superstore, LLC is a business that operates a retail store located at 1202 Westford St., Lowell, Massachusetts 01851, and may be served through its registered agent or at the premises where the events described below occurred.
1.3 The events giving rise to this action occurred on September 15, 2023 at the Defendant’s retail premises located at 1202 Westford St., Lowell, MA 01851, in Middlesex County.
1.4 This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action. Venue is proper in Middlesex County, Lowell Division, pursuant to the rules governing venue because the causes of action arose in Middlesex County at the Defendant’s retail location.

2. Summary of the Action
2.1 This is an action for damages arising out of Defendant’s negligence in maintaining and displaying heavy boxed merchandise in an unreasonably dangerous condition, which caused heavy boxed merchandise to fall and strike Plaintiff, producing a concussion, shoulder strain, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.

3. Facts
3.1 On September 15, 2023 at approximately [time omitted], Plaintiff was lawfully present as an invitee in Defendant’s retail store located at 1202 Westford St., Lowell, Massachusetts, looking at kitchen goods.
3.2 Defendant’s employees or agents had stacked heavy appliance boxes high on store shelving — approximately five or six boxes high — with no straps, barriers, guards, or other reasonable means to secure the merchandise and prevent its displacement.
3.3 While Plaintiff was in the aisle, another customer pushing a cart passed by and bumped a lower shelf in a normal manner. As a result of the insecure stacking and absence of reasonable restraints, a heavy toaster-oven box fell from near the top of the shelving and struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of her head.
3.4 Immediately after the impact, Plaintiff experienced dizziness and a severe headache. Store management came to the scene, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.
3.5 Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened later that day and she sought medical attention at an emergency room. Diagnoses included a mild concussion and a shoulder strain. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,200 in wages as a delivery driver as a direct result of the injuries. Plaintiff was also unable to play in her weekly soccer league for approximately one month.
3.6 All of the foregoing injuries and damages were proximately caused by the negligence of Defendant as set forth below.

4. Duty, Breach, Causation, and Damages (Negligence)
4.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
4.2 At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff (as a business invitee) a duty to exercise ordinary care to maintain the premises in a safe condition and to warn of known dangerous conditions which the Defendant created or of which it had actual or constructive knowledge. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; see also Massachusetts authority applying the same principles to invitees.
4.3 Defendant breached its duty by, among other things:
    a) Stacking heavy boxed appliances excessively high without safety straps, barriers, shelf lips, stop-blocks, or other reasonable restraints to prevent boxes from falling;
    b) Failing to maintain adequate training, supervision, and safety procedures for stocking and shelving heavy merchandise;
    c) Failing to inspect the shelving and displays with reasonable care and frequency, and failing to discover and correct the dangerous condition or to warn customers of the hazard; and
    d) Allowing hazardous conditions to exist in an aisle frequented by customers without taking reasonable precautions to prevent foreseeable harm.
4.4 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the unsecured heavy box fell and struck Plaintiff, causing a mild concussion, shoulder strain, dizziness, headache, medical expenses of approximately $2,500, lost earnings of approximately $1,200, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life (including inability to participate in Plaintiff’s weekly soccer league for about a month), and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
4.5 Plaintiff’s injuries were not substantially caused or contributed to by any voluntary act or negligence on Plaintiff’s part. To the extent defendant alleges comparative negligence, the negligence of any third party does not absolve Defendant of liability for its own negligence. (See, e.g., relevant comparative negligence statute and Massachusetts authorities.)

5. Statute of Limitations
5.1 This action is brought within the period allowed by law. The incident occurred on September 15, 2023; this Complaint is filed while the applicable statute of limitations remains in effect. See M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (action for injuries caused by negligence shall be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues).

6. Count I — Negligence (Sole Claim)
6.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 5 above as if fully set forth herein.
6.2 Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to exercise reasonable care for the safety of customers.
6.3 Defendant breached that duty by negligently stacking and displaying heavy merchandise and failing to take reasonable precautions to prevent foreseeable harm to invitees.
6.4 The breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
6.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer pain and disability, incurred medical expenses, lost earnings, and other damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

7. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant HomeGoods Superstore, LLC as follows:
    a) For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses (approximately $2,500), lost wages (approximately $1,200), pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other damages;
    b) For costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent allowable by law (Plaintiff appearing pro se hereby reserves the right to seek costs and fees if permitted by law);
    c) For pre- and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
    d) For a trial by jury on all issues so triable; and
    e) For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

8. Demand for Jury Trial
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

9. Authorities (Representative Statutes and Authorities)
Plaintiff relies upon the common law of negligence as developed by Massachusetts courts and authoritative tort principles, including but not limited to:
    - M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for negligence actions);
    - M.G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence principles), and related Massachusetts comparative negligence provisions;
    - Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty regarding dangerous conditions on land), § 344 and § 339;
    - Cases and Massachusetts authorities addressing premises liability and the duty owed to business invitees and the standards of care applicable to retailers and property owners (see, e.g., commonwealth and SJC/Appeals Court decisions recognizing duties of owners and occupiers to invitees and addressing foreseeability, inspection obligations, and proximate cause);
    - Massachusetts decisions discussing causation, foreseeability, breach of duty, and the allocation of fault in negligence actions.
Plaintiff will rely in support of specific legal propositions on the foregoing statutes, Restatement authorities, and Massachusetts SJC and Appeals Court precedent at trial and in support of motions as necessary.
