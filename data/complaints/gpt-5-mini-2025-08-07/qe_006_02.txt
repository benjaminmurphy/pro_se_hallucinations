Defendant

COMPLAINT
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, James Thompson, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”) resides at 45 Maple Street, Apartment __, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 and is a tenant there.

2. Defendant James Thompson (“Defendant”) is the landlord and owner/manager of the premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301, which is the rental unit occupied by Plaintiff.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a tenancy for the apartment effective May 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00.

4. This action arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, including the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential tenancies, and related statutory and regulatory provisions concerning habitability. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in Brockton District Court because the rental premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts. See M.G.L. c. 186; M.G.L. c. 239.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Beginning on or about November 10, 2025 (approximately three weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint), the hot water supply to Plaintiff’s apartment ceased functioning. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant by text message and by calling him on the same day.

6. Defendant responded and informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part, that he had ordered the part, and that he was working on obtaining and installing it.

7. Over the following three weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant that the unit still had no hot water. Defendant repeatedly informed Plaintiff that the part was backordered and that he could not make the supplier ship faster. Defendant continued to communicate and provided updates but failed to restore hot water.

8. As a direct result of the prolonged lack of hot water, Plaintiff has been unable to take hot showers or bathe her infant in the apartment. Plaintiff incurred new, out-of-pocket expenses for hygiene and childcare due to Defendant’s failure to provide hot water, including:

   a. Gym membership use and associated gas/transportation costs, which Plaintiff began using solely to take showers—an added cost Plaintiff estimates at approximately $30 per month plus fuel (out-of-pocket expense attributable to the lack of hot water);
   b. The need to take her baby to Plaintiff’s mother’s home for baths;
   c. Increased time, inconvenience, and discomfort associated with washing dishes with cold/near-boiling water and obtaining bathing facilities elsewhere.

9. The lack of hot water substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, rendered essential services unavailable, and constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and use of the apartment.

10. Despite actual knowledge of the condition and repeated requests for repair and restoration of hot water, Defendant failed to take reasonable, timely steps to restore hot water so as to abate the substantial interference. Defendant’s prolonged failure to provide a basic essential service is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential lease under Massachusetts law.

11. Plaintiff seeks damages and other relief for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff estimates her damages at $450.00, consisting of out-of-pocket expenses incurred and a fair and reasonable abatement of rent for the three-week period during which essential hot water service was unavailable. Plaintiff also reserves the right to prove additional damages (including costs and reasonable attorney’s fees if appropriate) at trial.

LEGAL BASIS — BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

12. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in residential tenancies and prohibits a landlord from substantially interfering with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 12.1 (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment); see also Massachusetts caselaw recognizing that a landlord’s failure to provide essential utilities or services may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (and render the landlord liable for damages and abatement). See, e.g., Rodgers v. Superior Court, and other principles discussed below.

13. Massachusetts statutes and regulations require landlords to maintain rental housing in compliance with applicable sanitary and housing codes and to provide essential services necessary for habitability. See, e.g., M.G.L. c. 111 (Public Health), M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord & Tenant), and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation; Housing). See also M.G.L. c. 239 (summary process and rents) for related procedural provisions.

14. Where a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, the tenant may recover damages and obtain a rent abatement proportionate to the harm. See, e.g., cases applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and rent abatement principles (see authorities cited below).

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law/Implied in the Lease)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment was implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy of the premises at 45 Maple Street.

17. Defendant’s prolonged failure to provide hot water to Plaintiff’s apartment, for approximately three weeks and continuing as of the filing of this Complaint, substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including but not limited to bathing, washing dishes safely, and providing a habitable environment for Plaintiff’s infant.

18. Defendant had actual notice of the lack of hot water and of Plaintiff’s requests for repair yet failed to restore hot water within a reasonable time or otherwise take reasonable alternative measures to abate the substantial interference.

19. Defendant’s acts and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the tenancy.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to out-of-pocket expenses (gym fees, transportation, childcare arrangements for bathing the infant) and diminution in the value of the tenancy (rent abatement for the period of deprivation). Plaintiff estimates her damages at $450.00 and reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For a money judgment in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $450.00 for compensatory damages caused by the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

B. For an equitable rent abatement for the period during which hot water was unavailable (to be determined at trial);

C. For costs of suit and filing fees;

D. For such further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate, including pre- and post-judgment interest where permitted by law.

Plaintiff hereby demands a jury trial on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025
