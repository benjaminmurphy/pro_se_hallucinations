I can draft the complaint for you, but I need to be transparent up front: I cannot fabricate or invent judicial opinions or case citations. I will therefore prepare a complete, professionally formatted complaint that includes the required sections (caption, factual allegations, single cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, prayer for relief, signature block) and I will cite Massachusetts statutory authorities and recognized secondary authorities (Restatement) and court rules that are directly applicable and that I can accurately reference without inventing case names. If you need specific Massachusetts case citations, I recommend having them added after a targeted legal-research check by an attorney, legal researcher, or law librarian. Below is a complaint draft based on the facts you provided and citing Massachusetts statutes, the Massachusetts Sanitary Code, the Restatement (Second) of Property (recognized authority on landlord-tenant duties), and applicable court rules.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Miller ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Thomas Landis ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff rents residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139 (the "Premises").

2. Defendant is the owner and landlord of the Premises and may be served at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, or at such other address as Defendant may be found.

3. Plaintiff commenced a tenancy at the Premises on May 1, 2022, pursuant to an oral or written month-to-month tenancy/lease (the "Tenancy"). Plaintiff currently pays rent of $2,400.00 per month.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Cambridge District Court because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Beginning in or about approximately October 2025, Defendant undertook renovations to the unit adjacent to Plaintiff's apartment in the same building, and Defendant authorized contractors and workers to perform construction work at the adjacent unit.

6. For the past two months (approximately October and November 2025), there has been substantial construction-related noise and disturbance emanating from the adjacent unit. The disruptive activity has included drilling, hammering, loud conversation among workers, and other construction noises.

7. The construction activity typically occurs between approximately 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays. The workers generally operate during normal business hours, and Defendant provided Plaintiff with notice in advance that renovations would occur.

8. The construction has continued for roughly two months, and Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the renovation may continue for another one to two months beyond the two months of disturbances that have already occurred.

9. The noise and vibration from the adjacent renovation has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. Plaintiff works from home and requires the ability to conduct telephone and video calls, concentrate on work tasks, and use the Premises for ordinary residential purposes.

10. In addition to noise, construction dust and particulate matter have entered Plaintiff’s unit through vents and other openings, contributing to unhealthy conditions, aggravating the interference with the enjoyment of the Premises, and requiring Plaintiff to undertake extra cleaning and taking measures to reduce dust and protect belongings.

11. Plaintiff has informed Defendant of the disruptive noise and dust and requested relief. Defendant offered a one-time, small rent reduction of $100 for one month, which Plaintiff rejected as insufficient compensation for the ongoing, substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.

12. As a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the form of loss of the benefit of the bargain of quiet enjoyment of the Premises, decreased habitability and utility of the unit for work and residential purposes, additional cleaning costs and time, and mental distress and inconvenience.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts common law)

13. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes tenants the covenant of quiet enjoyment: the tenant is entitled to possession and use of the premises without substantial interference by the landlord. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in leases and tenancies and guarantees that the tenant shall not be substantially disturbed in the enjoyment of the premises by the landlord’s acts or omissions.

15. Defendant, as landlord and owner of the building and the source of the renovations to the adjacent unit, has a duty not to substantially and unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. By authorizing, permitting, and continuing construction activity adjacent to Plaintiff’s unit for the time periods and in the manner described above, and by failing to take reasonable steps to mitigate the substantial interference, Defendant has materially breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. The interference has been substantial, continuing, and has deprived Plaintiff of the beneficial use of the Premises for the ordinary purposes for which leased residential premises are used—specifically by preventing effective work-from-home operations and by permitting dust infiltration that affects habitability and cleanliness.

17. Plaintiff provided notice to Defendant of the ongoing disturbance and requested relief; Defendant’s offered one-time $100 rent reduction for a single month is insufficient and does not cure the ongoing breach.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual, provable damages. Plaintiff estimates compensatory damages in the amount of $2,000.00 for loss of use, diminished value of quiet enjoyment, cleaning costs, and other losses related to the disruption. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this amount should further discovery demonstrate other quantifiable damages.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:

A. A judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages in the amount of $2,000.00, or such other amount as the Court finds just and proper upon proof at trial;

B. An award of costs of suit, including reasonable filing fees and other taxable costs;

C. Pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

D. Any such equitable relief as the Court deems necessary under the circumstances (including a judicial declaration as to Defendant’s continuing obligations to mitigate interference and to prevent further breaches);

E. Any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Authorities)
Plaintiff relies on the covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and related authorities. Representative statutory and regulatory authorities applicable to landlord-tenant relationships and habitability in Massachusetts include, without limitation:

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant generally) — statute governing landlord/tenant relations in Massachusetts.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary process; court procedures for eviction and related landlord-tenant matters).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Regulation of business practices; unfair and deceptive acts or practices that can apply in some landlord-tenant contexts).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public health statutes and local board of health authority pertaining to health and nuisance conditions).
- Local municipal ordinances (e.g., City of Cambridge noise-control and nuisance codes).
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 12.1 and related sections (authoritative treatise on the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord duties).
- Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure (Mass. R. Civ. P.), including rules governing pleadings, relief, and damages.
- District Court procedural rules (governing filings and practice before the Cambridge District Court).

Plaintiff also relies on Massachusetts common law recognizing an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in leases and that substantial interference, even if the landlord does not intend to evict, can constitute breach. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this list with specific Massachusetts cases and authorities following legal research.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

If you want, I can immediately:
- (A) Convert this draft into a more formal court-ready pleading formatted precisely for filing at Cambridge District Court (including cover sheet, civil action cover sheet, and proposed summons language), or
- (B) Add specific Massachusetts case law citations (SJC and Appeals Court decisions) that directly discuss the covenant of quiet enjoyment and similar landlord-tenant interference, but to do that accurately I will need to perform legal research to identify and confirm appropriate cases and their citations.

Which would you prefer? If you want option (B), I will proceed to research and add accurate Massachusetts case citations and additional statutory/regulatory references.
