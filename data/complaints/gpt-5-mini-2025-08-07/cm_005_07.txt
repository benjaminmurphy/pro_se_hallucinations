v.                                        Docket No.: ___________________

Michael Smith
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   1.1. Plaintiff: Emily Johnson, an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Contact: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant: Michael Smith, parent of the parties’ minor children, Liam Smith (born 2015) and Ava Smith (born 2017), who reside in this Commonwealth.
   1.3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under Massachusetts law and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, and personal jurisdiction over the parties because the children and the parties reside in this Commonwealth and because the parties are already before this Court on the existing custody order entered in this Court on May 14, 2021.

2. Procedural History
   2.1. A custody order governing the parties and their minor children was entered by this Probate and Family Court on May 14, 2021 (the “2021 Order”).
   2.2. The 2021 Order provides, among other things, that the parties share legal custody, that the children primarily reside with Plaintiff, and that the parties shall support the children’s relationship with each parent and shall not disparage the other parent in the presence of the children.

3. Basis for Relief — Material Change in Circumstances
   3.1. Plaintiff brings this Complaint pursuant to Massachusetts law permitting modification of custody and visitation orders upon a showing that (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the existing order and (b) the requested modification would be in the best interests of the children. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C; and applicable Massachusetts caselaw addressing modification based on material change in circumstances and best interest analysis.
   3.2. Since entry of the 2021 Order, a material change in circumstances has occurred that warrants modification of custody as described below:
       a. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly enrolled the children in activities that occur during Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time weekends without prior discussion or agreement with Plaintiff.
       b. Defendant then tells the children that it is Plaintiff’s “fault” if the children miss those activities when the children are with Plaintiff, thereby creating confusion and tension and undermining the parenting schedule.
       c. The children have reported overhearing Defendant call Plaintiff “selfish” and tell them that Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” when Plaintiff requests a weekend swap or raises concerns about scheduling. These disparaging statements violate the parties’ 2021 Order and have harmed the children’s emotional well‑being.
       d. As a result of the above conduct, one child (Liam) has begun experiencing recurrent stomach aches on transition days between households, symptoms that have increased over the past year and are consistent with stress and anxiety related to transitions and parental conflict.
       e. The conduct described above evidences an increase in parental conflict, active disparagement by the Defendant, unilateral scheduling decisions that interfere with Plaintiff’s parenting time, and emotional harm to the children — all developments materially different from the circumstances at the time the 2021 Order was entered.
   3.3. The foregoing constitutes a material and substantial change of circumstances since entry of the 2021 Order necessitating reconsideration of the custodial arrangement to protect the children’s best interests and emotional health.

4. Best Interests of the Children
   4.1. Plaintiff alleges that modifying custody so that the children primarily reside with Plaintiff, and implementing clear rules requiring mutual advance agreement for extracurricular scheduling and prohibiting disparagement, is in the children’s best interests. The requested modifications will:
       a. Reduce conflict and inconsistent messaging between parents;
       b. Provide predictability and continuity for the children’s school, extracurricular schedules, and healthcare;
       c. Protect the children from harmful parental alienating behaviors and minimize stress-related symptoms (e.g., stomach aches on transition days);
       d. Enable the primary residential parent to ensure stability and consistent routines necessary for the children’s welfare.
   4.2. In making custody modifications, the Court should consider the statutory and common-law factors governing the best interests of the child, including the child’s needs, the child’s adjustment to home and community, the willingness of each parent to foster a relationship with the other parent, and any history of harmful parental behavior. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C; and Massachusetts case law addressing best-interest factors in custody disputes.

5. Requested Relief
   5.1. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the 2021 Order as follows:
       a. Award primary residential (physical) custody of Liam (DOB 2015) and Ava (DOB 2017) to Plaintiff, with Defendant to have liberal and specific parenting time as the Court deems appropriate and consistent with the children’s best interests.
       b. Retain or clarify that the parties shall continue to share legal custody (or provide such modifications to legal custody as the Court determines appropriate), such that major decisions regarding the children (education, significant medical care, religious upbringing) require consultation and good‑faith cooperation between the parties and, where appropriate, mutual agreement.
       c. Order specific procedures governing extracurricular activities and scheduling: neither parent shall unilaterally enroll the children in activities that will occur during the other parent’s scheduled parenting time without at least 14 days’ prior written notice and the other parent’s consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If an activity must be scheduled during the other parent’s parenting time on short notice, the enrolling parent shall offer a reasonable make-up arrangement, and the parties shall follow a specified dispute-resolution procedure (e.g., expedited telephone conference with counsel or the Court’s child and family clinician) before taking unilateral action.
       d. Explicitly prohibit parental disparagement: the Defendant shall refrain from making derogatory, demeaning, or alienating remarks about Plaintiff to the children or in their presence. The Court shall adopt specific remedial measures for violations (e.g., make-up parenting time, counseling, contempt, and/or requirement to attend co‑parenting education or family therapy).
       e. Order assessment or counseling referrals as the Court finds appropriate (e.g., family therapy, child counseling, or parenting coordination) to address the children’s transition-related symptoms and parental conflict.
       f. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the children’s best interests, including attorneys’ fees, costs, and any interim emergency relief the Court finds appropriate.

6. Legal Authorities (Representative)
   6.1. Plaintiff bases this Complaint on the statutes and case law governing modification of custody and the best interests of the child in Massachusetts. Representative authorities include, but are not limited to:
       - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act).
       - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (provisions related to divorce, custody and related orders) (see, e.g., provisions granting the court authority over custody and modification).
       - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (Children, Youth and Families) (applicable provisions re: child welfare and protective services where relevant).
       - The Massachusetts Probate & Family Court Rules and relevant local rules governing modifications and contempt proceedings.
       - Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions recognizing the requirement of a material change in circumstances to modify custody and the necessity of assessing the best interests of the child (see e.g., cases addressing modification standards, parental alienation, and the effect of parental disparagement on children).
       - Cases discussing parental disparagement/alienation and custodial changes where children’s emotional health and routine were impacted (e.g., cases holding that repeated interference with parenting time, unilateral alteration of schedules, and disparaging conduct can support modification).
       - Decisions addressing remedies for contempt of custody orders and the court’s authority to enforce no‑disparagement provisions, order make‑up parenting time, require counseling, and impose sanctions.
       - Legal authorities recognizing that the court may fashion specific procedural requirements for scheduling extracurriculars and dispute-resolution mechanisms to reduce parental conflict.
       - Authorities recognizing the child’s right to a stable environment and that the court’s paramount concern is the welfare and best interest of the child.
   6.2. Plaintiff will rely on and cite more specific statutes and case law in support of these legal propositions during briefing and at hearing. Plaintiff cites the foregoing as illustrative statutory and decisional law under which the Court has authority to modify custody and enter the requested relief.

7. Affirmative Allegations Requiring Immediate Relief (if any)
   7.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court consider entry of temporary or interim orders as necessary to protect the children from ongoing harmful conduct and to prevent escalation of conflict while this matter is pending (including temporary clarification of parenting time, non‑disparagement orders, and expedited psychological evaluation or counseling for the children).
   7.2. Plaintiff is willing to participate in expedited alternative dispute resolution or evaluation (parenting coordination, mediation ordered by the Court, or referral to court clinical services) if the Court finds it helpful.

8. Prayer for Relief
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   A. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 14, 2021 custody order;
   B. Modify the existing custody order consistent with Paragraph 5 above, awarding primary residential custody of Liam and Ava to Plaintiff and implementing clear rules about scheduling extracurricular activities, prohibiting disparagement, and ordering remediation for violations;
   C. Order counseling, evaluations, or co‑parenting interventions as needed to protect the children’s best interests;
   D. Grant Plaintiff such interim and temporary relief as the Court deems necessary pending final determination;
   E. Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including attorneys’ fees and costs where appropriate; and
   F. Provide for any and all other relief the Court deems warranted to effectuate the children’s best interests.
