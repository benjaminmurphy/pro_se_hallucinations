City of Boston for a premises liability duty is inaccurate and unsupported by the opinion\u2019s holding or reasoning.",

So here, the petitioner could have challenged the removal in mandamus proceedings on the ground of insufficient notice at the time she received it, but she saw fit not to do so and requested the administrative review afforded by \u00a7 43 (b). Having done so, she must be deemed to have waived the deficiency in the notice...\""

The court\u2019s analysis turns on statutory interpretation of the Massachusetts Employment Security Law and on the nature of the trust interest, not on a general common\u2011law standard of reasonable care or foreseeability. The case does not discuss negligence, duty of care, or foreseeability in the tort sense, so it does not support the cited proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn the case before us, however, its seems plain that the payment of $1,231.70 was not made with reference to any possible period of unemployment. It was made because the trust was maintained for employees and it was natural that it should contain some provision whereby a beneficiary whose employment ceased should be paid his share and should cease to be a beneficiary. The amount paid to Kerr was exactly his share in the trust fund.\u201d"

The term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 does not appear, and no causation analysis is conducted in tort or any analogous context. Therefore, it does not support a proposition about proximate cause principles.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We are dealing in a specialized area in which fair market value normally cannot be determined with meaningful assistance from comparable sales or by the capitalization of income. Utilities may well have a valid complaint that for rate purposes one agency (the department) values their property at net book cost in a time of generally rising costs, while, for local tax purposes, the board places a substantially higher value on their property. The two processes are different, however, and the fact that there is a difference in valuation is not unlawful."
