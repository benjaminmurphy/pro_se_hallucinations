Civil Action No. ___________

JESSICA THOMPSON,
    Plaintiff,

v.

THOMAS WRIGHT,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue

1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is a resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant Thomas Wright is the landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124 (the “Premises”). Defendant may be served at his usual place of business or residence.

1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the statutory authority governing housing matters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the rules of the Boston Housing Court. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the Premises is located in Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

1.4 Plaintiff is a tenant who entered into possession of the Premises on or about January 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of $1,600.00 to Defendant since that date.

2. Statement of Facts

2.1 Plaintiff rents a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA (the “Premises”). Plaintiff began tenancy on January 1, 2022.

2.2 During the winter season of 2024–2025 (the “Winter”), the apartment’s central heat repeatedly fell well below comfortable living temperatures on multiple occasions. On many evenings the indoor temperature dropped to approximately 60°F for periods of hours at a time.

2.3 Plaintiff reported the recurring insufficient heat to Defendant. Defendant arranged for a repair technician on two separate occasions. On the first visit the technician represented he had fixed the issue; heating performance improved for approximately one week and then the problem recurred.

2.4 On the second visit a technician inspected the boiler and described it as “old but functional” and indicated there was not much more to do. Despite the inspections and repairs performed by Defendant’s agents, the problem continued to reoccur through the Winter months. Although the heat did not completely fail, it repeatedly dropped to levels that made the apartment unreasonably cold and uncomfortable.

2.5 To keep the Premises reasonably habitable, Plaintiff purchased and used two portable electric space heaters. The increased electrical consumption caused by the heaters increased Plaintiff’s electricity costs by approximately $150.00 per month during the affected months.

2.6 As a further consequence of the inadequate heating, Plaintiff developed bronchitis in January 2025. Plaintiff’s treating physician indicated the bronchitis was likely exacerbated by cold indoor air. Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred out-of-pocket costs for medical treatment, including antibiotics.

2.7 Defendant’s position, as communicated to Plaintiff, is that because the heating system never fully shut off and because the building did not become literally frozen, the heat was “working” and therefore Defendant had satisfied his obligations. Plaintiff contends, and alleges, that Defendant’s actions and omissions deprived Plaintiff of reasonable use and enjoyment of the Premises and breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

3. Claim for Relief: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)

3.1 Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.7 above as if fully set forth herein.

3.2 Under Massachusetts law, a landlord is bound by the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases. The covenant guarantees the tenant’s right to possess and use the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or by conditions caused or allowed by the landlord which materially impair the tenant’s ability to use the premises for their intended residential purpose.

3.3 Defendant had a legal duty to provide and maintain the Premises in a condition that would permit Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and reasonable use of the Premises as a dwelling. This duty includes maintaining essential services such as adequate heating during cold months, and either correcting recurring defects or providing a suitable remedy when repairs are ineffective or insufficient.

3.4 Defendant’s repeated failures to provide adequate and continuous heating — and his failure to secure a lasting repair after repeated complaints and two technician visits — substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. The repeated and prolonged drops to approximately 60°F during evening hours rendered the apartment unreasonably cold, forced Plaintiff to incur additional and necessary expenses for portable heating and increased electricity, and caused adverse health effects.

3.5 Defendant’s conduct — including making only temporary or ineffective repairs, representing the heating as merely “working” while the condition persisted, and failing to provide a durable remedy — constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

3.6 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff sustained damages including, but not limited to:
   a. Out-of-pocket electricity expenses incurred as a result of running two space heaters (approximately $150 per month for the months affected);
   b. Medical expenses and related costs incurred as a result of bronchitis and associated treatment;
   c. Lost wages for time missed from work (three days);
   d. General damages for loss of use, discomfort, inconvenience, emotional distress and interference with the ordinary use of the Premises; and
   e. Costs of suit and interest.

3.7 Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff estimates actual compensatory damages in the amount of $900.00. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this damage calculation with additional documentation of medical expenses, utility bills, lost wages, and other losses suffered as a result of Defendant’s breach, and to seek additional relief as proof at trial may warrant.

4. Demand for Jury Trial

4.1 Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff JESSICA THOMPSON respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant THOMAS WRIGHT as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages in the amount of $900.00, plus such additional sums as are proven at trial for out-of-pocket expenses, medical bills, lost wages, and other compensatory damages;
B. Awarding consequential damages for increased utility costs and health-related expenses caused by Defendant’s breach;
C. Awarding pre- and post-judgment interest at the maximum lawful rate;
D. Awarding the costs of this action and any other relief the Court deems just and proper;
E. Granting such further relief as the Court deems equitable and necessary to afford Plaintiff the relief to which she is entitled.

Dated: December 1, 2025
