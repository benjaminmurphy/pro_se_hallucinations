    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff entered possession of the studio on Feb. 1, 2023, pays monthly rent ($1,600) and identifies Defendant as the owner/landlord of the Premises (\u00b6\u00b61.2, 1.4, 2.1). A lease/tenancy relationship is therefore pleaded."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges repeated factual notice of a ceiling leak and that Defendant declined to promptly and effectively remedy it, characterizing it as a cosmetic issue (\u00b6\u00b62.3\u20132.4, 3.5). Those allegations plead an omission/failure to act by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges recurring water intrusion that soaked furniture, ruined a laptop, produced a musty odor and headaches, forced Plaintiff to move her bed and belongings, and deprived use of a substantial portion of the apartment (\u00b6\u00b62.5\u20132.7). Those facts sufficiently allege a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the leak occurred at the same location as pre-existing stains, that Plaintiff notified Defendant and requested repair, and that Defendant failed to remedy the leak, leading to property damage, odor, health symptoms and loss of use (\u00b6\u00b62.2\u20132.6, 3.5). Those allegations adequately plead that the landlord's conduct/omission caused the interference and damages."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint identifies concrete economic damages (replacement cost of laptop: $900) and non-economic harms (diminished use/enjoyment, emotional distress, consequential damages) and seeks compensatory relief (\u00b6\u00b62.5, 2.8, 4(b)). These allegations sufficiently plead damages for the claim."
