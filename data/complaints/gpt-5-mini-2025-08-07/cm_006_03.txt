JESSICA THOMPSON
Petitioner

v.

MARK JOHNSON
Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/PHYSICAL CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner Jessica Thompson ("Petitioner"), residing at ------------- (address omitted), may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent Mark Johnson ("Respondent") resides at ------------- (address omitted).
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes governing custody and modification of custody orders and the general equity power of the Probate and Family Court. Venue is proper in the Berkshire Probate and Family Court because the existing custody order was entered in this Court and the children reside primarily with Petitioner in this county.

2. Children
2.1 The subject children are Emily Johnson, born 2015 (age 10), and Lucas Johnson, born 2017 (age 8) (collectively, "the Children").

3. Prior Order
3.1 On March 15, 2021, this Court entered an order (the "Existing Order") awarding primary physical custody of the Children to Petitioner with Respondent having alternate weekends and one midweek visit.
3.2 The Existing Order did not address the presence of romantic partners, new household members, or third parties during Respondent's parenting time because, at the time, neither party was in a long-term relationship.

4. Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred that affects the safety and welfare of the Children.
4.2 Specifically, Respondent now resides with an adult partner ("Respondent's Partner") who:
  a. Has a criminal record that includes at least one conviction for assault and battery.
  b. Previously was the subject of a court-issued restraining order obtained by a former intimate partner.
4.3 The Children have reported and Petitioner has observed the following incidents and conduct while the Children have been in Respondent's care or at Respondent’s residence:
  a. Frequent loud yelling and slamming of doors during arguments in the presence of the Children.
  b. On at least one occasion, Respondent's Partner grabbed one of the Children with sufficient force to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm.
  c. A neighbor called the police during a particularly loud and violent-seeming argument at Respondent's home while the Children were present; police responded to the residence.
4.4 The foregoing incidents, together with the criminal history and prior restraining order involving Respondent's Partner, present a real and immediate risk to the physical safety and emotional well-being of the Children and constitute a material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order.

5. Legal Basis for Modification
5.1 Custody and physical custody orders entered by this Court are modifiable upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children. Modification must be guided by the best interests of the child standard. See, e.g., Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights and the best-interests standard); and established Massachusetts practice that custody modifications rest within the trial court’s discretion where circumstances materially affect the children’s welfare.
5.2 Massachusetts law recognizes the Court’s power to modify custody and visitation to protect children from harm and to impose reasonable restrictions on third parties who may pose a danger to the children, including conditions on visitation, supervised visitation, and exclusion of individuals from the custodial environment. See, e.g.: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (domestic abuse restraining orders); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (mandated reporting and procedures relating to child abuse and neglect); and well-established probate and family court practice permitting supervised or restricted visitation where necessary to protect children’s safety and welfare.

6. Facts Showing Necessity of Relief
6.1 The combination of (a) Respondent’s Partner’s criminal history (assault and battery conviction), (b) the prior restraining order against Respondent’s Partner, (c) direct physical contact causing injury to a child, (d) repeated loud, aggressive conduct and arguments in the presence of the Children, and (e) a police response to incidents at the Respondent’s residence constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the Existing Order.
6.2 The Children are currently in primary physical custody of Petitioner and are exposed to no such immediate risk in Petitioner’s home. Continued unsupervised visitation that permits Respondent’s Partner to be present with the Children has caused and will continue to cause harm to the Children’s safety and emotional welfare unless conditions are imposed.

7. Relief Requested
Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
7.1 Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order such that modification is warranted under Massachusetts law and the best interests of the Children.
7.2 Modify the Existing Order to prohibit Respondent’s Partner and any other adults with a criminal record for violent offenses or who are subject to prior restraining orders from being present during Respondent’s parenting time with the Children; OR, in the alternative,
7.3 Order that all of Respondent’s parenting time with the Children shall be supervised by an approved third-party supervisor or supervised visitation provider until further order of the Court, with terms to be set by the Court (including identity/qualifications of supervisor, scope and frequency of visits, and reporting requirements).
7.4 Enter a temporary ex parte order (if appropriate and supported by the evidence) imposing the restrictions above pending a full hearing, if the Court deems immediate relief necessary to protect the Children.
7.5 Order Respondent to produce to the Court and to Petitioner, under seal if necessary, information sufficient to verify the background and criminal history of Respondent’s Partner (including full legal name and date of birth), and to submit the partner to background checks and any evaluations the Court deems appropriate.
7.6 Refer the matter to the Department of Children and Families and/or to local law enforcement for investigation as appropriate pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A, and notify the Court of the results.
7.7 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the Children’s safety, health, and welfare, including costs and fees to the extent permitted by law.

8. Legal Authorities (representative)
