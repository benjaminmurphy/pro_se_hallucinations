  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges a tenancy beginning May 1, 2022, that Plaintiff pays monthly rent ($1,200), and that Defendant is the owner/landlord of the premises (see \u00b6\u00b61.1\u20131.3, 2.1). These facts establish the landlord\u2011tenant relationship without needing the legal label."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint pleads specific landlord conduct and omissions: limited placement of snap traps, authorization of a single exterminator visit, and an explicit refusal to authorize comprehensive pest treatment despite recommendations (see \u00b6\u00b62.2\u20132.6, 4.2). These are acts/omissions by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint alleges ongoing, weekly mouse droppings, continued presence of rodents, loss of food, purchase of storage containers, diminished use and enjoyment of the kitchen/apartment, anxiety and distress\u2014facts alleging a material/substantial interference with quiet enjoyment (see \u00b6\u00b62.6\u20132.7, 4.2\u20134.3)."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "A factual chain is alleged: Plaintiff notified Defendant of mice; Defendant\u2019s limited measures and refusal to authorize recommended comprehensive treatment followed; the infestation persisted and resulted in specified harms. These allegations adequately plead that the landlord\u2019s conduct caused the interference (see \u00b6\u00b62.2\u20132.6, 2.7, 4.2\u20134.3)."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint specifies economic losses (approx. $200 for discarded food and $80 for containers, totaling $280) and alleges non\u2011economic harms (anxiety, loss of use, inconvenience), and seeks compensatory damages and injunctive relief (see \u00b6\u00b62.7, 5.1\u20135.2, 6.1\u20136.2). These facts sufficiently plead damages."
