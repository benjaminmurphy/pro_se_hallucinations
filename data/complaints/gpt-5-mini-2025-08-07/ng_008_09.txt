COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1.     Plaintiff Sarah Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by counsel pro se, brings this Complaint against Quincy Bistro ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2.     Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is an individual and resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

3.     Defendant Quincy Bistro is a food service business doing business at 123 Main St, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the restaurant premises at 123 Main St.

4.     The events giving rise to this action occurred on September 15, 2023, at the Quincy Bistro premises located at 123 Main St, Quincy, Massachusetts.

5.     Jurisdiction is proper in the Massachusetts Superior Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the events occurred in Massachusetts and the parties are located in Massachusetts.

6.     Venue is proper in Norfolk County — Quincy Division because the Defendant's business is located in Quincy and the incident occurred in Quincy.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7.     On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully present at Quincy Bistro as a business invitee to dine.

8.     At or about the location described above, in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, a server employed by or under the control of Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses, which broke.

9.     The server picked up the broken glass promptly but left water and ice on the tile floor in the hallway. The server told others that she would "be right back with a mop" but did not immediately mop or otherwise remove or dry the water and ice.

10.    No employee or agent of Defendant placed any warning sign, barrier, cone, or other protective device to warn patrons of the hazardous, wet condition on the tile floor. No employee directed Plaintiff or other patrons away from the hazard.

11.    Approximately ten minutes later, while moving through that hallway to use the restroom, Plaintiff stepped into the area of pooled water. The surface appeared wet and glistening. Plaintiff slipped and twisted her knee, falling as a direct result of the hazardous wet condition that had been allowed to remain on the tiled hallway floor.

12.    After the incident, Plaintiff heard employees of Defendant stating that they had been "dodging that puddle" for some time prior to Plaintiff's fall, indicating Defendant’s awareness (actual or constructive) of the hazardous condition.

13.    Plaintiff sought medical treatment at urgent care that same day and was diagnosed with a sprained knee. Plaintiff was fitted with a knee brace and required physical therapy over the ensuing weeks.

14.    As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of Defendant, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, disability, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages, including but not limited to medical expenses of approximately $2,000 and lost wages of approximately $1,500.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

15.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16.    At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as an invitee on Defendant's premises, to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition, to warn of known dangerous conditions, and to take reasonable steps to discover and correct dangerous conditions that the Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about. This duty includes a duty to either make safe, warn, or promptly remedy a dangerous condition such as a slippery floor caused by spilled water and ice.

17.    Defendant breached that duty by, among other acts and omissions:
        a. permitting a hazardous condition (spilled water and ice on a tiled hallway used by patrons) to remain uncorrected for a prolonged period;
        b. failing to place appropriate warnings (e.g., wet floor signs, cones, barriers) or take other reasonable precautions to protect patrons from the hazard;
        c. failing to mop, dry, or otherwise remove the water, ice, and slippery condition despite the opportunity and obligation to do so promptly after the tray was dropped; and
        d. otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

18.    Defendant knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known about the hazardous condition in the hallway (as evidenced by employees’ later statements that they had been "dodging that puddle"), and had the time and ability to correct the hazard or warn patrons before Plaintiff entered the area.

19.    Defendant's breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries. Plaintiff would not have slipped and injured her knee but for Defendant’s failure to remedy the wet and icy condition or warn patrons.

20.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical and rehabilitation expenses (approximately $2,000 to date), lost wages (approximately $1,500 to date), and other damages, all in an amount to be determined at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A.     Awarding compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses, lost wages, and other economic losses in an amount to be proven at trial (including the approximate amounts of $2,000 in medical expenses and $1,500 in lost wages incurred to date), together with damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial;

B.     Awarding pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

C.     Awarding costs and disbursements of this action, including filing fees and reasonable costs of litigation;

D.     Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

AUTHORITY (selected legal principles relied upon)

Plaintiff relies upon established Massachusetts and general tort law principles governing negligence and premises liability, including but not limited to:
- Duty to invitees to maintain premises in safe condition and to warn of dangerous conditions;
- Liability for failure to warn or remedy a perilous condition on the premises;
- Comparative negligence principles reducing recovery in proportion to any plaintiff fault (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85);
- Statute of limitations for personal injury actions (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty regarding dangerous conditions on land) and § 343A (liability for failure to warn); and
- Foundational negligence principles articulated in classic tort authorities (e.g., Donoghue v. Stevenson) and Massachusetts case law construing the duty owed by proprietors to invitees.

(For counsel: Plaintiff requests that any formal brief or memorandum of law submitted in support of the complaint cite Massachusetts precedents addressing premises liability and the duty to warn invitees and to exercise reasonable care to discover and remedy hazards. Plaintiff will supplement with specific Massachusetts case citations and statutory authority as required during litigation.)

I certify that on this date I will serve a copy of this Complaint on Defendant Quincy Bistro at its place of business at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA, by hand/U.S. mail/other method in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.
