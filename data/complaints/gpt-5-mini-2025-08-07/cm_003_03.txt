v.

Michael Brown
   Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY AND REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF

1. Parties and Residence
   1.1 Petitioner: Jessica Taylor, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2 Respondent: Michael Brown, address unknown to Petitioner for filing purposes but a party to the existing custody order in this Court.
   1.3 Child: Ethan Brown, born [DOB withheld; age 8], who is subject to the custody order referenced below.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1 This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters involving Ethan pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and rules, including the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C).
   2.2 Venue is proper in this Court because the original custody order was entered in this court and the child resides primarily with the Petitioner in Middlesex County.

3. Existing Order
   3.1 On May 15, 2021, this Court entered an order awarding shared legal custody of Ethan Brown to Petitioner and Respondent, with physical custody such that Ethan lives primarily with Petitioner and visits Respondent on certain weekends (the “May 15, 2021 Order”).

4. Nature of Action / Relief Requested
   4.1 Petitioner brings this Complaint for Modification of Custody pursuant to the Court’s authority to modify custody and visitation orders upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child.
   4.2 Petitioner requests: (a) a temporary emergency order suspending or conditioning Respondent’s unsupervised overnight parenting time pending hearing and investigation; (b) a permanent modification to impose supervised overnight visitation or other conditions on Respondent’s parenting time as the Court deems appropriate; (c) an expedited hearing on temporary relief; (d) any necessary investigative, protective, and remedial orders (including but not limited to supervised visitation, substance testing, counseling, and restrictions on unsupervised overnight stays); and (e) costs and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

5. Factual Allegations Demonstrating a Material Change in Circumstances
   5.1 At the time of the May 15, 2021 Order, the Court found the parties to be sufficiently stable to share legal custody and for Ethan to have weekend visitation with Respondent. Since that Order, circumstances material to Ethan’s safety and welfare have changed significantly.
   5.2 Beginning in mid-2024 and continuing to the present, Ethan has made repeated spontaneous statements to Petitioner indicating that Respondent provides or uses “special drinks” at Respondent’s home and that Respondent is sometimes physically impaired there. Ethan has told Petitioner that Respondent “can’t walk straight” at times while caring for him.
   5.3 A neighbor who is aware of this family’s custody arrangement recently provided Petitioner with a video showing Respondent stumbling while transferring Ethan out of a vehicle late at night. The video suggests Respondent’s balance and coordination were compromised when he had custody of Ethan.
   5.4 School personnel have reported to Petitioner that Ethan appears unusually tired and exhausted every Monday morning, which corresponds with Ethan’s weekend time with Respondent. The school’s observations include repeated reports that Ethan is falling asleep in class, arriving to school less rested, and that his teacher and school staff are concerned for his welfare.
   5.5 These events—(a) Ethan’s statements about “special drinks” and Respondent’s inability to walk straight while caring for him; (b) the neighbor’s video of Respondent stumbling while handling Ethan; and (c) the school’s reports of Ethan’s exhaustion each Monday—collectively constitute a material change in circumstances since the May 15, 2021 Order that directly affects the child’s safety, health, and welfare.
   5.6 Petitioner reasonably believes, based on these facts, that unsupervised overnight parenting time with Respondent creates a substantial risk of physical harm to Ethan and that interim protective measures are necessary to preserve Ethan’s safety pending judicial determination.

6. Legal Basis for Modification
   6.1 Under Massachusetts law, a court may modify a custody or visitation order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child. The overriding standard governing custody and visitation decisions in Massachusetts is the best interests of the child, and a demonstrated material change in circumstances warrants modification or temporary relief when the child’s safety or welfare is at risk.
   6.2 Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court apply the material-change-and-best-interests framework set forth in controlling Massachusetts authority and statutes, including but not limited to: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (obligations and procedures regarding reports of child abuse or neglect); the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody orders to protect the welfare of children; and relevant Massachusetts case law recognizing that where a parent’s substance use or impairment poses a risk to the child, imposition of supervised visitation or restrictions on overnights is an appropriate remedial measure to protect the child’s safety. (See Legal Authorities section below.)

7. Temporary Relief Requested
   7.1 Because the factual allegations above indicate a present risk to Ethan’s physical safety and welfare, Petitioner requests that the Court issue an immediate temporary order, pending full hearing and investigation, that should include:
       (a) Suspension of Respondent’s unsupervised overnight visits with Ethan until further order of the Court;
       (b) If the Court allows any in-person parenting time before final hearing, that such parenting time be supervised by an adult approved by the Court or a supervised-visitation provider; and
       (c) Any appropriate conditions such as random or reasonable suspicion-based alcohol and/or substance testing of Respondent before parenting time, mandatory participation by Respondent in a substance-assessment program or counseling, and cooperation with any court-ordered investigations (including any 51A inquiries).
   7.2 Petitioner seeks an expedited calendar date and temporary ex parte relief if the Court deems an emergency showing has been made.

8. Additional Requests
   8.1 Petitioner requests that the Court order disclosure and exchange of relevant records (including any school reporting of Ethan’s exhaustion and any medical or mental-health records relating to Ethan’s wellbeing), that the Court order any necessary 51A inquiry or referral to the Department of Children and Families if warranted, and that the Court issue such protective orders as necessary to ensure Ethan’s safety.
   8.2 Petitioner further requests attorney’s fees and costs if the Court finds that such an award is justified under the circumstances.

9. Verification and Prayer for Relief
   9.1 Petitioner verifies under penalty of perjury that the facts set forth in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.
   9.2 WHEREFORE, Petitioner requests that this Court:
       (a) Schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and consider interim protective relief;
       (b) Issue a temporary order suspending Respondent’s unsupervised overnight parenting time with Ethan and imposing supervised visitation and/or other conditions as the Court finds necessary for Ethan’s safety pending final hearing;
       (c) After hearing, modify the May 15, 2021 Order to impose supervised visitation and/or conditions on Respondent’s parenting time, or otherwise modify custody or visitation consistent with the best interests of Ethan;
       (d) Order any investigations, evaluations, testing, or services (including substance assessment and supervised visitation providers) the Court deems necessary;
       (e) Order disclosure of relevant school and medical records and any other relief necessary to protect Ethan’s welfare; and
       (f) Award Petitioner costs, fees, and such other relief as justice requires.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES (SELECTED STATUTES AND CASES)
(Note: Petitioner cites these authorities as among those governing custody modification, temporary emergency relief, and the best-interests/material-change framework in Massachusetts.)

   Massachusetts Case Law (representative decisions addressing modification, material change, best interests, and safety-based restrictions)
