      "raw_text": "Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984)",
      "citation_type": "case",
      "proposition": "Massachusetts and other authorities recognize that substantial interference with habitability, including pest infestation that materially interferes with the tenant\u2019s use of the premises, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment for which the landlord is liable if the landlord fails to take reasonable remedial measures after notice.",

      "supports_proposition": false,
      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The case is about the implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, not about the covenant of quiet enjoyment. While the opinion discusses conditions (including rodents) that impair habitability and the landlord\u2019s liability after notice and failure to repair, it never analyzes or characterizes such conditions as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. It also does not purport to describe Massachusetts law beyond a brief quotation from Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway solely on the contract-based theory of habitability, not on quiet enjoyment or pest infestation specifically.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "[T]he residential tenant who has suffered a breach of the warranty . . . cannot bathe as frequently as he would like or at all if there is inadequate hot water; he must worry about rodents harassing his children or spreading disease if the premises are infested; or he must avoid certain rooms or worry about catching a cold if there is inadequate weather protection or heat. Thus, discomfort and annoyance are the common injuries caused by each breach and hence the true nature of the general damages the tenant is claiming."

      "support_reasoning": "The case is a New York decision construing the statutory implied warranty of habitability (Real Property Law \u00a7 235\u2011b), not the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment, and it does not address Massachusetts law. While it recognizes that insect or rodent infestation and similar conditions materially affecting health and safety can breach the warranty of habitability, it does not characterize such conditions as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment nor discuss landlord liability under that covenant after notice. Thus it supports the habitability part of the proposition, but not the specific quiet enjoyment / Massachusetts component for which it is cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cFor example, no one will dispute that health and safety are adversely affected by insect or rodent infestation, insufficient heat and plumbing facilities, significantly dangerous electrical outlets or wiring, inadequate sanitation facilities or similar services which constitute the essence of the modern dwelling unit. If, in the eyes of a reasonable person, defects in the dwelling deprive the tenant of those essential functions which a residence is expected to provide, a breach of the implied warrant of habitability has occurred.\u201d"
