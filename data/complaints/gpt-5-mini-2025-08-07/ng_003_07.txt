COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Patel, pro se, and for his Complaint against the Defendant Home Goods Warehouse alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION & VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Patel is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Home Goods Warehouse is a retail business that operates a discount home-goods store located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, and at all relevant times owned, leased, managed, maintained, and/or controlled the premises and merchandise at that location.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lowell, Middlesex County.

4. Plaintiff brings this action in Middlesex Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) and 10(a), and requests a jury trial pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

FACTS

5. On August 15, 2023, at approximately [time not required for pleading], Plaintiff was lawfully present as a business invitee inside the Defendant’s store located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

6. The aisles in the relevant retail area contained heavy boxed appliances stacked high on shelving — approximately five to six boxes high — without straps, barriers, rails, or other securement devices to prevent reasonably foreseeable displacement or falling of boxes.

7. Another customer, while pushing a shopping cart down the same aisle, bumped a lower shelf in a normal manner. As a direct and foreseeable consequence of the unsecured, excessively high stacking of heavy boxes and the lack of reasonable safeguards, a large boxed toaster-oven fell from near the top of the shelf.

8. The falling box struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and on the side of his head. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a severe headache.

9. The store manager attended to Plaintiff at the scene and completed an incident report. The manager offered Plaintiff a store coupon; no adequate medical assistance was provided at the scene.

10. That evening Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, and Plaintiff presented to the hospital emergency department. Emergency medical personnel and treating clinicians diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,800 and suffered lost wages of approximately $600 due to missed work as a delivery driver. Plaintiff also missed participation in his regular recreational soccer league for approximately one month and suffered pain, suffering, disability, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of the capacity for the enjoyment of life.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages)

12. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to invitees, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, inspection, and operation of its premises and to take reasonable precautions to protect customers from foreseeable hazards, including unsecured or improperly stacked heavy merchandise. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty of possessor of land to keep premises safe); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 323 (negligent conduct causing physical harm to another).

14. Defendant breached that duty by negligently stacking and storing heavy boxed appliances on high shelving without adequate restraints, barriers, or safeguards; by failing to inspect, discover, and correct the dangerous condition within a reasonable time; and by otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care for the safety of its invitees. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 343, 343A; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 285–286 (liability for negligent failure to warn or make safe).

15. The falling box and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries were a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence. The injury was foreseeable — a heavy box stacked high and unsecured in a retail aisle could reasonably be expected to fall and injure a customer if the shelf was bumped. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 343; see also cases recognizing foreseeability and proximate cause in premises liability matters.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered injury, harm, and damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, disability, and other economic and non-economic losses as alleged above.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF — LEGAL AUTHORITY

17. Plaintiff’s negligence claim is governed by the common law principles of negligence as applied in Massachusetts. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 284, 285, 286, 288A, 324A, 343, 343A (general principles of duty, breach, causation, and harm); see also Massachusetts common-law authority applying these principles.

18. Plaintiff asserts damages in accordance with Massachusetts law. The applicable statutes and authorities include, without limitation: M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury actions), M.G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence and reduction of damages), Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) and 10(a) (pleading rules), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 (jury demand).

19. Massachusetts appellate and Supreme Judicial Court precedent supports liability where a possessor of land or its agent fails to exercise reasonable care in the storage and display of merchandise and such failure causes foreseeable injury to an invitee. See, e.g., cases addressing premises liability, duty to business invitees, and foreseeability of harm (see, e.g., Restatement authority and Massachusetts cases construing similar principles).

(Representative authorities — by way of illustration and not exhaustive: Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 284–286, 288A, 302B, 324A, 343, 343A; M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A; M.G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 10(a), 38; and Massachusetts decisions interpreting premises liability and negligence principles.)

DAMAGES

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages, in amounts known at this time as follows:
   a. Past medical expenses: approximately $1,800;
   b. Past lost wages: approximately $600;
   c. Past and future pain and suffering, disability, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of the capacity for the enjoyment of life — to be determined at trial;
   d. Costs of suit and interest as allowed by law.

21. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional damages and to amend this Complaint as further medical records, wage documentation, and other evidence become available.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief as follows:

A. That the Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for compensatory damages in an amount sufficient to fully compensate Plaintiff for past and future medical expenses, past and future lost earnings, past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other losses sustained as a result of Defendant’s negligence, in an amount to be determined at trial;

B. That the Court award Plaintiff costs, interest (including pre-judgment interest where appropriate), and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable;

C. That Plaintiff be granted a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

NOTES ON AUTHORITY (SELECTED)

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for personal injury).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence principles reducing recovery).
- Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 10(a), 38 (pleading and jury trial rules).
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282 (duty), 284–286 (negligent acts and omissions), 288A (liability for acts), 302B (liability for negligent conduct of third persons), 324A (duty for negligent performance of undertaking), 343 & 343A (duty of possessor of land regarding dangerous conditions and liability to invitees), and related sections on foreseeability and proximate cause.

Representative Massachusetts authorities have applied these principles in premises-liability and negligence contexts, recognizing a business owner’s duty to exercise reasonable care to keep aisles and displays safe for invitees and to guard against foreseeable harm. See, e.g., cases construing premises liability and foreseeability principles in Massachusetts (courts have looked to Restatement (Second) of Torts and to state precedent for application of duty, breach, proximate cause, and damages).
