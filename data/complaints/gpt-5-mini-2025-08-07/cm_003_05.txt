Michael Smith
     Respondent/Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner/Plaintiff: Sarah Johnson, parent of the minor child named below. Contact information for the Petitioner: telephone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent/Defendant: Michael Smith, parent of the minor child named below.
1.3 Minor Child: Ethan Johnson, born [200?-DOB not provided in original facts; age: 10 as of filing].
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, §28, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (M.G.L. c. 209B). The existing custody order was entered in this Court on October 15, 2021 (hereafter “the 2021 Order”).

2. Nature of the Action
2.1 Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, §28, the Petitioner seeks modification of the 2021 Order based on a material change in circumstances affecting the best interest and safety of the minor child.
2.2 Specifically, Petitioner requests (a) that overnight parenting time by the Respondent be suspended or limited to supervised visitation pending a hearing on modification; and (b) entry of a permanent order imposing supervised visitation and safety-related conditions (such as no overnight unsupervised visits, random substance screening, and parenting education), or other relief the Court deems appropriate to protect the child.

3. Background and Existing Order
3.1 On or about October 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order awarding the parties shared legal custody of their child, Ethan Johnson, with primary physical residence being with Petitioner and scheduled visitation with Respondent, including certain weekend overnights (the “2021 Order”).
3.2 At the time of the 2021 Order, the Court found both parents to be sufficiently stable for the shared custody arrangement and unsupervised visitation as ordered.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
Since entry of the 2021 Order, materially changed circumstances have arisen that were not contemplated by the Court and which substantially affect the child’s safety and welfare. Petitioner alleges the following facts demonstrating a material change in circumstances:

4.1 Child’s Statements and Behavior
- Within the past year, the child, Ethan (age 10), has repeatedly told Petitioner that there are “special drinks” at Respondent’s residence and that sometimes Respondent “can’t walk straight” after being at his home.
- Ethan has reported being sleepy and exhausted on Monday mornings after weekend visitation with Respondent.

4.2 Observations and Documentary Evidence
- A neighbor, who is familiar with the parties’ custody arrangement, has provided Petitioner with a video showing Respondent stumbling while assisting Ethan out of a car late at night after a visitation with Ethan. The video suggests that Respondent may have been impaired at that time.
- The school has communicated concerns to Petitioner about Ethan’s apparent exhaustion and diminished functioning on school days following weekend visits to Respondent’s home.

4.3 Safety Concerns
- The totality of the child’s statements, the neighbor’s video, and the school’s observations establish credible and contemporaneous evidence raising substantial concerns about Respondent’s ability to safely parent Ethan during unsupervised overnight visits.
- These circumstances are materially different from those before the Court at the time of the 2021 Order and directly bear on the child’s safety and best interests.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Modification Standard. Under M.G.L. c. 208, §28, and the applicable Massachusetts case law interpreting that provision, modification of a custody order is appropriate upon a showing of a “material change in circumstances” that affects the child’s welfare and requires a different custodial arrangement in the child’s best interest.
5.2 Best Interests of the Child. The Court’s primary consideration is the child’s best interests, including the child’s safety, health, and emotional welfare; the parties’ ability to care for the child; and any other factor relevant to the child’s welfare.
5.3 Emergency or Interim Relief. Where evidence suggests a present risk to the child’s safety, the Court may order temporary or emergency relief (including suspension of overnight visits or placement of supervised visitation) pending a full hearing on permanent modification.

6. Allegations in Support of Relief Requested
6.1 The described statements by Ethan, the neighbor’s video of Respondent stumbling while handling the child late at night, and the school’s reports of Monday morning exhaustion constitute new, material facts that directly bear on the child’s safety and welfare and were not known to the Court or addressed in the 2021 Order.
6.2 These new facts constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the custody and visitation provisions of the 2021 Order.
6.3 Given the specific allegations that Respondent may be impaired while caring for the child (including late-night stumbling and the child’s report of “special drinks”), unsupervised overnight visitation with Respondent poses a real and immediate risk to Ethan’s safety and welfare.
6.4 Petitioner is requesting a modification narrowly tailored to protect the child while preserving the child’s relationship with Respondent to the extent it is safe to do so. Petitioner seeks supervised visitation, substance testing conditions, and parenting education for Respondent as appropriate conditions for any unsupervised visits in the future.

7. Requested Relief
Petitioner requests that this Court enter an order providing the following relief:
7.1 Emergency / Temporary Relief (pending hearing):
   a. Suspend Respondent’s overnight unsupervised visitation with Ethan and require that any in-person contact with Respondent be supervised by a Court-approved or mutually agreed supervised visitation provider until further order of the Court; and/or
   b. Order Respondent to submit to random or court-ordered substance screening at intervals the Court deems appropriate as a condition of any return to unsupervised visitation; and
   c. Direct that any parent exchange occur in a public or neutral place during daylight hours until the Court orders otherwise; and
   d. Order that school personnel be permitted to communicate with Petitioner and the Court concerning Ethan’s attendance, behavior, and any indicators of fatigue or impairment following visitation.
7.2 Permanent Relief (after hearing):
   a. Modify the permanent parenting time provisions of the 2021 Order to reflect supervised visitation for Respondent, restrictions on overnight unsupervised visits, and the imposition of conditions (including substance testing and participation in a parenting class or substance-evaluation/treatment if recommended); and
   b. Any other relief the Court deems necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Ethan, including costs of supervised visitation, and such other and further relief as justice requires.

8. Notices and Reports
8.1 Petitioner gives notice that, given the allegations of possible impairment and the child’s statements concerning “special drinks” and Respondent’s inability to “walk straight,” Petitioner has reason to request that the Court consider whether a report under M.G.L. c. 119, §51A should be made or has been made, and requests that the Court permit or order any appropriate child protective investigation consistent with law.

9. Reservation of Rights
9.1 Petitioner reserves the right to introduce additional evidence, testimony, and exhibits at hearing, including the neighbor’s video and school reports, and to request other appropriate findings and relief based on the evidence presented.

10. Authority
Petitioner respectfully relies upon and invokes the Court’s authority under:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §28 (custody and modification of custody orders);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209B (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§51A–51B (reporting and investigation of child abuse/neglect) and related protective statutes;
- General principles governing custody modifications and best interests determinations as recognized by Massachusetts courts;
- Federal parental-rights jurisprudence recognizing the importance of parental rights limited by child-safety considerations (e.g., Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000)), and relevant Massachusetts case law interpreting the “material change” and “best interests” standards applicable under M.G.L. c. 208, §28.
(Petitioner will cite and rely upon specific Massachusetts authority and decisions at or before hearing as appropriate.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner requests that this Court:
A. Schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and grant temporary emergency relief as set forth in Paragraph 7.1 above pending a full hearing on modification;
B. After hearing, enter a modified custody/visitation order as set forth in Paragraph 7.2 above (or such other orders as the Court finds are in the best interests of the child); and
C. Grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper, including costs, fees, and any other equitable relief related to the protection and welfare of Ethan.
