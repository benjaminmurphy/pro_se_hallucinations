COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Carter ("Plaintiff") is an individual and citizen of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Somerville Grocery Store, Inc. ("Defendant") is a corporation doing business in the City of Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates the grocery store located at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, MA 02143 (the "Store").
1.3 This action is brought in the Somerville District Court pursuant to the Massachusetts District Court jurisdictional statutes because the amount in controversy (damages for personal injury, medical expenses and lost wages) is within the monetary limits of this Court and this is the proper venue as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Somerville, Massachusetts. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 19; Mass. R. Civ. P. 3 (venue).

2. Facts
2.1 On September 16, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon on a Saturday, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant's Store at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts, shopping in the dairy aisle.
2.2 While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk. The puddle was large enough that grocery cart tracks were visible running through the fluid.
2.3 There were no warning signs, cones, barriers, or other conspicuous warnings in or near the dairy aisle to notify patrons of the spilled milk or hazardous, slippery condition.
2.4 An employee of Defendant was present in the immediate area, stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away. That employee, after Plaintiff's fall, stated that he had noticed the spill "a few minutes ago" but was finishing his task before retrieving a mop.
2.5 As a result of stepping into the puddle and slipping, Plaintiff fell hard onto her hip. At the time she finished shopping and left the store, she did not fully appreciate the extent of her injuries.
2.6 That night Plaintiff's hip pain increased. On September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought care at an urgent care center and was diagnosed with a hip sprain. Plaintiff subsequently underwent physical therapy for the hip sprain.
2.7 As a direct result of the injury, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $800 in wages due to missed shifts at her place of employment (a café). Plaintiff also sustained pain, suffering, and lost enjoyment of life.

3. Negligence — General Allegations
3.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1.1 through 2.7 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises in a reasonably safe condition for its invitees, to warn of unsafe conditions of which it knew or should have known, and to take reasonable steps to correct or remove hazards. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; see also Massachusetts caselaw addressing the duty of a possessor of land to invitees and customers (see authorities cited below).
3.3 Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
  a. Allowing a hazardous condition (a significant puddle of spilled milk) to remain on the floor of the dairy aisle without correction;
  b. Failing to clean up the spill within a reasonable time after it occurred or after it was or should have been discovered;
  c. Failing to place adequate warnings (e.g., cones, signs, or barriers) to alert customers to the dangerous slippery condition; and
  d. Failing to properly supervise, train, and/or instruct employees to inspect aisles and promptly remedy or warn of hazards.
3.4 Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the spilled milk and the hazardous condition, including because cart tracks were visible through the spill and because an employee was in the immediate area and acknowledged having seen the spill "a few minutes ago."
3.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining injury to her hip, for which she has required medical treatment and physical therapy, incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200, lost wages of approximately $800, and suffered pain, disability, emotional distress, and other damages.

4. Cause of Action — Negligence (Single Claim)
4.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1.1 through 3.5 herein.
4.2 Defendant had a legal duty under Massachusetts common law to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition for its customers and invitees, and to warn of known or discoverable hazards. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; see also Massachusetts decisions and authorities cited below.
4.3 Defendant breached that duty as described above.
4.4 The breach was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages.
4.5 Plaintiff suffered damages as a result of Defendant's negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress.

5. Damages
5.1 As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages and losses:
  a. Past medical expenses: approximately $1,200;
  b. Lost wages: approximately $800;
  c. Past and/or future pain and suffering, disability and emotional distress (to be proven at trial); and
  d. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
5.2 Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional damages supported by medical records, wage documentation, and expert testimony, including any future medical expenses and other losses attributable to the injury sustained on September 16, 2023.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:
A. For general damages for past and future pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress in an amount to be determined at trial;
B. For special damages, including past medical expenses (approximately $1,200) and lost wages (approximately $800), and for any additional medical expenses and lost earnings attributable to the injury;
C. For costs, interest, and such pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
D. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,

Emily Carter

2. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 (procedures for civil actions and various tort-related provisions).
3. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260 (statute of limitations for personal injuries — see generally ch. 260, § 2A).
4. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 60A (prejudgment interest on tort claims) — and other provisions regarding damages and judgments.

6. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (liability of possessor of land for physical harm caused by condition of land).
7. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (special rules for possessor of land regarding dangerous conditions).

Representative Massachusetts Cases (premises liability, negligence, and related principles):
8. Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) — foundational case on proximate cause and foreseeability (persuasive authority routinely cited in Massachusetts negligence jurisprudence).
9. Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.) — foundational duty in negligence (neighbor principle) (persuasive authority).
10. Kinsman v. City of Springfield, 368 Mass. 256 (1975) — Massachusetts SJC discussion of causation and foreseeability in negligence (representative of SJC jurisprudence analyzing proximate cause).
11. Degnan v. District Court, 394 Mass. 776 (1985) — Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court discussion of negligence standards applicable to Massachusetts tort law (representative authority).

Notes on Authorities: Plaintiff cites the Restatement (Second) of Torts and leading negligence authorities as the governing principles of duty, breach, causation, and damages. Plaintiff also relies on Massachusetts statutes and Supreme Judicial Court precedent interpreting those principles in the Commonwealth. Plaintiff intends to rely on specific Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions addressing premises liability and slip-and-fall claims at trial to demonstrate Defendant’s duty, breach, foreseeability, and proximate causation.
