COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Karen Reynolds ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual and a resident of Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Karen Reynolds is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851 (the "Premises"), and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

3. Plaintiff has been a tenant of the Premises pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy beginning May 1, 2022.

4. The amount in controversy for Plaintiff’s monetary damages is modest (Plaintiff seeks $200 in compensatory damages). This action is properly filed in Lowell District Court, which has jurisdiction and venue over landlord-tenant actions involving the Premises located in Lowell, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. The Premises includes a bathroom without a window; the only ventilation for the bathroom is an exhaust fan installed in the ceiling.

6. In or about mid-2024 (and continuing through 2025), Plaintiff discovered visible mold growth in the corner of the shower. The mold subsequently spread to the bathroom ceiling.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold growth and requested remediation and, if necessary, improvements to the ventilation system to reduce moisture and prevent recurrence.

8. Defendant inspected the bathroom in response to Plaintiff’s report. Defendant acknowledged the presence of mold but told Plaintiff that the mold was the result of Plaintiff’s conduct — specifically, that Plaintiff does not run the exhaust fan enough and takes showers that are “too hot and too long.”

9. Plaintiff does run the exhaust fan when she showers, although she may not run it for every minute of every shower; she takes reasonably warm showers consistent with common household practice. The bathroom lacks any other means of ventilation (no window).

10. Defendant has stated she will clean the visible mold but refuses to address the ventilation or otherwise make repairs or improvements to prevent recurrence, asserting that Plaintiff “caused” the mold.

11. Since the appearance of the mold, Plaintiff has suffered new and ongoing respiratory symptoms, including coughing, nasal congestion, and wheezing, which she did not have prior to the mold’s appearance.

12. Plaintiff sought medical care. Her treating physician has advised that Plaintiff’s respiratory symptoms are related to exposure to mold and recommended prompt remediation and correction of the underlying moisture and ventilation problems.

13. Damaged personal property: as a proximate result of the mold, Plaintiff disposed of a shower curtain and several towels that were contaminated and unsuitable for continued use; Plaintiff estimates the value of those items at approximately $60.

14. Plaintiff has suffered other losses and inconvenience, and she seeks compensation for the diminution of habitability and for the interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

15. Under Massachusetts common law, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that the tenant’s possession will not be substantially interfered with by the landlord or by conditions attributable to the landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in leases and tenancies. See, e.g., Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and tenant’s remedies); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (discussing warranty of habitability and quiet enjoyment); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant §§ 1.1–1.3, 18–19 (discussing landlord obligations and tenant remedies).

16. Massachusetts statutes and regulations address sanitary and habitability standards for residential dwellings and vest local boards of health and the Department of Public Health with authority to enforce minimum standards. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health), 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code—Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant law generally); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process jurisdiction and procedures for landlord-tenant matters).

17. A landlord’s deliberate refusal to remedy conditions that render a dwelling unfit for habitation or that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Javins, supra; Green, supra; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant §§ 18–19. Massachusetts courts and authorities apply the common-law covenant and statutory standards in assessing landlord obligations and tenants’ remedies in similar circumstances.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law)

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.

19. Plaintiff held and continues to hold lawful possession of the Premises.

20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment was and is implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy.

21. Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to ensure that the Premises were maintained in a condition that did not substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the dwelling, including a duty to address conditions that create health hazards and substantially impair habitability (such as persistent mold and inadequate ventilation).

22. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, among other things:
    a. failing to remediate the mold problem in a timely and adequate manner;
    b. refusing to correct the underlying ventilation deficiency in the bathroom that has allowed mold to develop and reoccur;
    c. failing to take reasonable steps to prevent ongoing exposure to mold and the accompanying health risks; and
    d. attributing responsibility solely to Plaintiff and declining to make necessary repairs and improvements to prevent the recurrence of mold.

23. Defendant’s breach has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises by creating an unreasonably unsafe and unhealthy condition, causing physical symptoms, damaging Plaintiff’s personal property, and causing inconvenience and distress.

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including medical-related impacts, loss of personal property (approximately $60), and other compensable harm, and she seeks monetary damages, equitable relief, and costs.

Notes and practical guidance (for Plaintiff’s use only):
- Consider preserving photographic evidence of the mold, copies of written communications with Defendant (texts, emails, letters), the doctor’s note linking your symptoms to mold exposure, and receipts for discarded items.
- You may contact the Lowell Board of Health or the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for inspection under 105 CMR 410.000 if you seek administrative enforcement of sanitary standards.
- If you later obtain legal counsel, counsel may add or refine statutory and case citations; additional claims (e.g., negligence, breach of statutory duties, or other remedies) may be appropriate depending on further legal analysis.
