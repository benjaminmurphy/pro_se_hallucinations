COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, through pro se (contact information below), alleges the following causes of action against Defendant Mark Reynolds:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual and resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Reynolds is an individual who resides in Springfield, Massachusetts and was at all times relevant herein the owner and possessor of the ladder that is the subject of this Complaint.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on March 15, 2023 at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Hampden Superior Court because the tortious conduct and resulting injury occurred in Hampden County. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 10; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223; see also Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who reside in a duplex and share a common driveway located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

6. Defendant kept a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against the wooden fence on the common driveway next to Plaintiff’s ordinary parking space.

7. On multiple occasions before March 15, 2023, Plaintiff informed Defendant that she was concerned the ladder might fall onto her car, particularly on windy days. Defendant responded that he would tie the ladder down or move it, but he failed to do so.

8. On March 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was backing into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street, a gust of wind knocked the unsecured ladder over. The ladder fell onto Plaintiff’s parked automobile, striking and denting the hood and cracking the windshield.

9. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained property damage (dent to hood and cracked windshield), required repair and replacement of the windshield and bodywork, and Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket costs including payment of the insurance deductible and rental car expenses while her vehicle was repaired for over one week.

10. Plaintiff did not suffer medical expenses or lost wages as a result of this incident.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

11. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–10 as if fully set forth herein.

12. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff asserting negligence must prove that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, that the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach was a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s damages. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282; see also Massachusetts jurisprudence applying these principles. See, e.g., Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (foreseeability and duty); Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 24 Cal. 2d 453 (1944) (manufacturer and foreseeability principles); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 299 (duty to anticipate the conduct of others). Massachusetts courts analyze duty, breach, causation, and damages in negligence actions. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 285, 323, 324A (negligent acts and omissions; liability for affirmative acts and failure to act where reasonable care required).

13. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in placing, storing, securing, and maintaining the ladder so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to persons or property who might foreseeably be affected, including Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s automobile. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 291, 302B, 328A; see also Palsgraf, 248 N.Y. 339; Escola, 24 Cal.2d 453.

14. Defendant breached that duty by negligently leaving the tall extension ladder unsecured and leaning against a fence adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area, and by failing to secure, tie down, move, or otherwise make the ladder safe despite having been warned by Plaintiff and having promised to do so.

15. Defendant’s breach was a direct and proximate cause of the ladder falling during a wind gust and of the resulting damage to Plaintiff’s automobile.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage to her automobile, including damage to the hood and a cracked windshield, incurred the insurance deductible, rental car expenses while her vehicle was in the shop for over one week, and other consequential expenses.

17. Plaintiff’s damages are the direct and proximate consequence of Defendant’s breach of his duty of care.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITY

18. Plaintiff relies on the general negligence standard as set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts and as applied in Massachusetts courts, including principles relating to duty, foreseeability, breach, proximate causation, and damages. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282 (standard), 285 (standard of care where conduct creates risk), 302B (duty to those affected by acts), 323 (liability for failing to act), 324A (duty owed where actor’s conduct increases risk); see also Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928); Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 24 Cal. 2d 453 (1944); and other authorities discussing foreseeability and duty to prevent harm to third parties.

19. Plaintiff also cites the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure governing pleadings and the Superior Court’s authority to hear negligence claims. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (short and plain statement), Mass. R. Civ. P. 10(a) (pleading caption), Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim), and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for tort actions). Plaintiff alleges this action is timely under the applicable statute of limitations.

20. Plaintiff further cites Massachusetts state and appellate court precedent recognizing that a land possessor or person who stores or places potentially dangerous items has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to others and can be held liable for negligent acts or omissions that cause property damage. See, e.g., Restatement citations above; see also general tort principles applied in Massachusetts decisions addressing proximate cause, foreseeability, and liability for property damage caused by an unsecured object.

(For ease of reference, representative authorities include: Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 285, 291, 302B, 323, 324A, 328A; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928); Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 24 Cal. 2d 453 (1944); and the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Mass. R. Civ. P. 8, 10, 12(b)(6); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on Count I (Negligence);

B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for property damage to her vehicle, reimbursement of insurance deductible, rental car expenses and other incidental and consequential losses incurred as a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence;

C. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

D. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including filing fees and any other allowable costs; and

E. Grant any other and further relief that the Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
