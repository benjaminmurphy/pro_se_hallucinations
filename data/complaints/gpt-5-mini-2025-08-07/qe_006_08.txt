COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maria Lopez (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Lopez”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment __, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant John Harrison (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, and is a person within the jurisdiction of this Court.

3. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for the subject residential premises commencing June 1, 2022, and pays monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant.

4. This action is filed in Brockton District Court because the subject premises are located in Brockton and the amount in controversy is within this Court’s jurisdictional limits.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1–4 as if fully set forth herein.

6. On or about November 3, 2025 (approximately three weeks before the filing of this Complaint), Plaintiff discovered there was no hot running water in her apartment. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant the same day and requested repair.

7. Defendant acknowledged the problem and informed Plaintiff that a part for the water heater was necessary and had been ordered.

8. Over the following three weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant that the apartment continued to lack hot water. Defendant replied to Plaintiff’s communications and informed Plaintiff that the part was backordered and that he was “working on it” and could not force the supplier to ship faster.

9. Despite Defendant’s communications, no effective repair was completed and Plaintiff has continued to be without hot running water for approximately three weeks as of the date of this Complaint.

10. As a direct and proximate result of the loss of hot water, Plaintiff has been unable to bathe comfortably in her apartment, has been forced to incur out-of-pocket expenses to obtain basic hygienic needs, and has suffered disruption of the use and enjoyment of her home. Specifically:
   a. Plaintiff has been forced to use a gym to shower, at an added monthly cost of approximately $30 (plus transportation expenses), an expense she did not incur prior to the outage.
   b. Plaintiff has had to take her baby to Plaintiff’s mother’s home for baths because the baby cannot be bathed in cold water.
   c. Plaintiff has had to boil water to wash dishes and otherwise change her ordinary household routines and incur additional expense and inconvenience.

11. Plaintiff’s continued lack of hot water substantially interferes with the safety, comfort, and reasonable use and enjoyment of the premises as a residence.

12. Plaintiff has paid rent in full and on time throughout the tenancy, including for the period during which the hot water was not provided.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1–12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law and well-established landlord-tenant doctrine, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the implied warranty of habitability in residential leases. A landlord’s failure to provide essential services such as hot water may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and of the landlord’s obligations to provide premises fit for residential use. See Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing an implied warranty of habitability and that failure to supply essential services can constitute breach); see also Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974); Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (discussing warranty of habitability and tenant remedies); accord applicable Massachusetts authorities and statutory/regulatory standards referenced below.

15. Massachusetts law and regulation require that residential rental premises meet minimum standards of fitness for human habitation. The Massachusetts Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.) sets forth minimum standards for heat and hot water, plumbing and sanitary facilities, and other conditions affecting habitability, and provides that landlords are responsible for maintaining such services. See 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.

16. Massachusetts statutes and public-health laws impose duties on landlords and provide that habitability requirements extend to provision and maintenance of essential services, including hot water. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health statutes; including enforcement of sanitary code standards), and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant).

17. By failing to provide hot running water for an extended period, Defendant substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the tenancy, and breached the landlord’s duties to maintain the premises fit for residential habitation.

18. Defendant’s failure to timely repair and restore hot water, whether through neglect, unreasonable delay in obtaining replacement parts, or failure to ensure essential service continuity, directly caused Plaintiff’s damages, including additional out-of-pocket expenses, loss of ordinary use of the dwelling, inconvenience, emotional distress, and other damages.

19. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including, but not limited to, compensatory damages, a monetary abatement of rent for the period the premises were not fit for ordinary residential use, costs, and interest.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITY

20. The rights and remedies asserted herein are supported by the following authorities (representative, non-exhaustive list):
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes)
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health generally and enforcement of sanitary standards)
   - 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
   - Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (implied warranty of habitability; covenant of quiet enjoyment)
   - Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) (warranty of habitability recognized and damages/remedies)
   - Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (warranty of habitability; tenant remedies)
   - Park West Management Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979) (recognizing tenant remedies for diminution of services)
   - Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982) (property rights and landlord responsibilities — general authority regarding property rights and landlord obligations)
   - Cambridgeport v. Mayor of Cambridge (referencing the role of health codes and inspections; local enforcement principles)
   - Relevant Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions interpreting landlord duties, the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and habitability standards (see, e.g., authorities construing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 and the Sanitary Code). 

   (Plaintiff will rely on these statutes, regulations, and cases and on such other authorities as may be cited at or before trial.)

DAMAGES

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff estimates and alleges that she has suffered damages including:
   a. Monetary expenses and losses incurred as a result of Defendant’s failure to provide hot water (including gym membership or pay-per-use shower costs, gasoline/transportation costs to obtain showers, costs associated with having to take her baby to another residence for bathing, and costs of boiling water to wash dishes);
   b. A reasonable rent abatement for the period of diminished use and enjoyment of the premises;
   c. Interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

22. Plaintiff estimates the recoverable economic damages at this time to be approximately $450.00 for out-of-pocket expenses and abatement of rent for the period in question, exclusive of interest, costs, and any additional damages the Court may award upon proof at trial. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional damages if further evidence reveals greater loss.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. On Count I (Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment), award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the sum of at least $450.00 (or such other amount as proven at trial), plus pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

B. Award Plaintiff a reasonable rent abatement for the period(s) during which the hot water service was not provided and the premises were not fit for ordinary residential use;

C. Award Plaintiff costs and disbursements of this action, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable;

D. Grant Plaintiff declaratory relief that Defendant’s failure to provide hot water constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s duty to maintain the premises in a habitable condition under applicable law and the Massachusetts Sanitary Code;

E. Grant such additional relief as the Court deems appropriate.

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

(End of Complaint)

Notes:
- Plaintiff should complete the caption with the civil action number once the Court assigns it, fill in the apartment number, and select the actual method of service on the Certificate of Service in accordance with Mass. R. Civ. P. and local rules.
- This Complaint asserts only the single claim requested by Plaintiff: breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law (with supporting statutory/regulatory and case authority). If Plaintiff seeks to add other claims (e.g., Chapter 93A, breach of warranty of habitability, injunction, or statutory remedies before a board of health), those would require additional pleadings and facts.
