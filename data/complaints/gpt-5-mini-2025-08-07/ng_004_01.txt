COMPLAINT — PERSONAL INJURY (NEGLIGENCE)

Plaintiff Jessica Miller ("Plaintiff"), pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Samantha Harris ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted by telephone at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Samantha Harris is the owner of the three-unit apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the "Premises"). Upon information and belief, Defendant is a resident of Massachusetts and at all times relevant to this Complaint owned, maintained, managed, and/or controlled the Premises.

3. The incident giving rise to this Complaint occurred on February 15, 2023, at or near the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

4. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in this Court because the acts and omissions alleged below occurred in Worcester County and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, controlled, maintained, and/or occupied the Premises, including responsibility for the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Premises. As owner of the building, Defendant had an obligation to keep the sidewalk reasonably safe for persons invited or expected to use it.

6. In or about February 2023, a snowstorm occurred in Worcester. Defendant took some action by shoveling a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises but did not place salt, sand, grit, or other de-icing material on the cleared path.

7. Over the next two or more days, melt during the daytime followed by refreezing at night caused the narrow shoveled path to become a sheet of ice — a dangerous and hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk.

8. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the sidewalk at or near 123 Maple Street while delivering groceries to one of the building’s tenants. Plaintiff walked up the sidewalk in a normal manner.

9. Plaintiff stepped onto the icy zone formed in the narrow shoveled path that Defendant had cleared without de-icing material. Plaintiff’s feet slipped out from under her, causing her to fall backwards and land forcefully on her lower back.

10. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a lower back injury, for which she sought and received medical treatment. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses related to the injury.

11. As a direct result of the injury, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week and lost approximately $800 in wages.

12. After the ice formed and before Plaintiff’s fall, tenants of the Premises had texted Defendant about the icy condition and had sent photographs. Defendant responded to tenants that "the sun will take care of it" and took no further action to treat or remediate the icy condition (e.g., by applying sand, salt, or another de-icing material), despite having notice and opportunity to do so.

13. Defendant knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known of the hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk, and Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to protect invited entrants such as delivery persons from foreseeable risk of harm.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 above as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for invited users, including invitees and licensees such as delivery persons, and to exercise reasonable care to warn of or correct hazardous conditions of which Defendant knew or should have known.

16. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. failing to take reasonable measures to remove, treat, or warn of the hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk (for example, by applying sand, salt, or similar de-icing material);
    b. leaving only a narrow shoveled path that allowed conduits for melt-and-refreeze, creating a sheet of ice that was hazardous to normal pedestrian use;
    c. failing to act after notice (including texts and photographs from tenants) that a dangerous icy condition had formed; and
    d. otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

17. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and the injuries and losses she sustained, including physical injury to her lower back, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered special damages in the approximate amount of $3,300 (approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and $800 in lost wages), and general damages for pain and suffering and other losses in an amount to be determined at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to special damages of approximately $3,300 and general damages for pain and suffering, disability, and impairment;

B. Interest and costs allowed by law;

C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

LEGAL AUTHORITY

Plaintiff intends to rely upon Massachusetts common law principles of negligence and premises liability as applied by the Massachusetts courts, the Restatement (Second) of Torts (particularly sections addressing duty and the responsibilities of landowners to persons lawfully on their property), and applicable Massachusetts statutory law concerning tort actions and remedies. Representative authorities that govern and inform the negligence claim include, but are not limited to:

- Massachusetts common law principles of negligence and premises liability (as established by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Appeals Court);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343 & 343A (duty of possessor of land to invitees and licensees);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 (general provisions governing civil actions and tort law in the Commonwealth);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260 (statute of limitations and related provisions for civil actions);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (provisions relating to landlord and tenant responsibilities relevant to duties of property owners);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 84 (provisions addressing public ways and related duties that may be relevant to maintenance of sidewalks);
- Leading treatises and authorities on tort law, including Prosser & Keeton on Torts and other standard works interpreting duty and breach in premises-liability actions;
- Relevant Massachusetts precedent addressing landowner/landlord duty, notice, and foreseeability in slip-and-fall and ice/freeze-refreeze cases (decisions of the SJC and Mass. Appeals Court applying the foregoing principles).

(If the Court requires more specific citation to particular Massachusetts appellate decisions or statutory sections, Plaintiff will furnish the precise authorities at or before trial; Plaintiff asserts that the allegations above state a claim for negligence under Massachusetts law.)
