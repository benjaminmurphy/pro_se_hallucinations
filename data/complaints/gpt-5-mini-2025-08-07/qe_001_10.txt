John Mitchell

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(STRICTLY LIMITED CLAIM: BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT UNDER MASSACHUSETTS LAW)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Thompson”) is an individual resident of Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information: (617) 555-0123; psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant John Mitchell (hereinafter “Defendant” or “Landlord”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA 02124 (the “Premises”), and may be served at that address or at such other place as he may be found.
1.3 Plaintiff has been a tenant of the Premises since January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,800 to Defendant.
1.4 The amount sought in this action is $600 in damages (exclusive of costs and interest), and this Court therefore has jurisdiction. Venue is proper in Boston Municipal Court under M.G.L. c. 218, and because the Premises are located in Dorchester, within the court’s territorial jurisdiction.

2. Statement of Claim
2.1 Plaintiff brings this single and sole claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, seeking monetary damages caused by Defendant’s breach.

3. Facts Common to All Counts
3.1 Plaintiff rents a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA 02124 pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy that began on January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $1,800 per month in rent.
3.2 During the winter of 2024–2025 (including the months of December 2024 through March 2025), Plaintiff experienced recurring and substantial deficiencies in the heat supplied to the Premises. On multiple evenings, indoor temperature fell to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time.
3.3 Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating problems. Defendant arranged for repairs on two separate occasions. After the first repair, the heat functioned adequately for about one week, but the heating problem recurred. A second repairman inspected the heating system and described the building boiler as “old but functional,” and informed Plaintiff there was “not much more to do.”
3.4 Despite the repairs, the heating failures continued intermittently. While the heating system never completely shut off, the intermittent drops in temperature rendered the apartment unreasonably cold and caused substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises during the winter months.
3.5 To keep the apartment habitable and safe, Plaintiff purchased and used two portable electric space heaters. The extra electricity usage increased Plaintiff’s monthly electric bills by approximately $150 per month for the months in question.
3.6 Plaintiff suffered physical harm as a result of exposure to prolonged cold indoor temperatures. In January 2025 Plaintiff contracted bronchitis; her treating physician attributed that illness as likely aggravated by cold indoor air. As a result, Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred out-of-pocket expenses for medical treatment and antibiotics.
3.7 Defendant’s response has been to assert that the heat is “working” because the system never completely shut off and the building “is not freezing.” Defendant, however, knew or reasonably should have known that intermittent substantial drops in heat constituted a significant interference with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the Premises and the habitability of the dwelling.
3.8 Plaintiff has sustained economic and non-economic damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including increased utility costs (approximately $150/month for space heater use), medical costs, lost wages for missed work, and general discomfort and inconvenience. Plaintiff reasonably estimates total damages at $600, consisting of out-of-pocket expenses and partial rent abatement for reduced use and enjoyment of the Premises during the winter months.

4. Claim — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
4.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1.1 through 3.8 above.
4.2 Under Massachusetts law, every lease (including implied terms of a tenancy) carries an implied covenant that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment of the premises, free from substantial interference by the landlord that deprives the tenant of the beneficial use and occupation of the premises. See generally Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential tenancies); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 5.1, 12.1 (implied covenants and tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment).
4.3 Massachusetts courts and courts applying Massachusetts law have treated substantial interference with heat, hot water, and similar fundamental services as continuing breaches that may support claims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and/or implied warranty of habitability. See, e.g., cases and authorities recognizing landlord obligations and tenant remedies in circumstances where essential services were not reasonably maintained; see also Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) (establishing heating requirements and minimum standards).
4.4 Defendant’s failure to provide reasonably continuous and adequate heat during the winter months, notwithstanding repeated notice and partial repairs, substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and deprived Plaintiff of the benefits of the tenancy. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
4.5 Plaintiff’s damages were proximately caused by Defendant’s breach. Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket expenses for emergency heating (space heaters), increased electrical bills, medical expenses, and lost wages flow directly from Defendant’s breach and the loss of quiet enjoyment.
