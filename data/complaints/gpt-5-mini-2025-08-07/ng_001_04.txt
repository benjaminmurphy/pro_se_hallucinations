Greenway Grocery Store,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE (Personal Injury)

Plaintiff Jessica Martinez ("Plaintiff" or "Martinez"), pro se, complains against Defendant Greenway Grocery Store ("Defendant" or "Greenway") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Greenway Grocery Store is a business that operates a retail grocery store located at 123 Main St., Somerville, Massachusetts. On information and belief, Greenway owned, operated, maintained and/or controlled the premises at that location on the date of the incident described below.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Main St., Somerville, MA.

FACTS

5. On Saturday, September 30, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff went to Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Main St., Somerville, Massachusetts to purchase groceries.

6. While walking in the dairy aisle of the store, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk and slipped, falling hard onto her right hip. The puddle was of sufficient size that cart tracks were visible through it.

7. There were no warning signs, cones, barricades, or other warnings to notify customers of the hazard or to block access to the spilled liquid at the time Plaintiff fell.

8. An employee of Defendant was present in the immediate area — approximately fifteen feet away from the spill — and was observed by Plaintiff. After the fall, the employee told Plaintiff he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing up another task before he was going to get a mop.

9. Plaintiff completed her shopping that day because she believed she was able to do so, but later that night began to experience significant hip pain.

10. On September 31, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical attention at an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed with a hip sprain. Plaintiff was prescribed conservative care and referred for physical therapy.

11. As a result of the injury, Plaintiff underwent a course of physical therapy and incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200. Plaintiff also missed several work shifts at her place of employment (a café), resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.

12. Plaintiff’s injuries, medical treatment, and lost earnings were proximately caused by the fall that occurred on Defendant’s premises on September 30, 2023.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to customers lawfully on its premises, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn of dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or should have known, and to take reasonable precautions to discover and rectify dangerous conditions.

15. Defendant breached its duty of care in one or more of the following respects:
    a. Failing to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition by permitting a dangerous accumulation of spilled milk to remain in a customer aisle;
    b. Failing to exercise reasonable care to discover and remedy the hazardous spill within a reasonable period of time after its occurrence or after notice of same;
    c. Failing to post adequate warnings, signs, cones, or other protective measures to alert customers to the spill;
    d. Failing to train, supervise, or instruct employees adequately on the prompt remediation of spills and customer-safety procedures, and/or failing to have reasonable policies and procedures in place and/or to follow such policies and procedures;
    e. Failing to take any other reasonable actions to prevent foreseeable harm to customers from spills on the floor.

16. On information and belief, Defendant’s employee observed the spilled milk and knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the dangerous condition and failed to take reasonable steps to warn customers or to clean up the spill in a timely manner.

17. Defendant’s breaches were the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered:
    a. Physical injury (hip sprain) requiring medical evaluation and physical therapy;
    b. Medical expenses of approximately $1,200;
    c. Lost earnings in the amount of approximately $800;
    d. Pain, suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience;
    e. Such other and further damages as the Court may determine.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

19. Plaintiff brings this action within the time period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A).

DAMAGES

20. As a direct and proximate consequence of the negligence of Defendant, Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to the special damages described above (medical expenses and lost wages), general damages for pain and suffering, and costs of this action.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages, in an amount to be proven at trial but at least in the amount of Plaintiff’s actual special damages ($2,000) and a fair and just sum for general damages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience;

B. Award Plaintiff pre- and post-judgment interest as provided by law;

C. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper; and

D. Grant Plaintiff a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
