COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Hall, pro se, and for her Complaint against the Defendant HomeGoods Plus, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hall is an individual and at all times relevant to this Complaint was a resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant HomeGoods Plus is a retail business doing business in Lowell, Massachusetts and operating a store located at 1230 Main St, Lowell, MA 01851, where the incident described below occurred.

3. The District Court has jurisdiction over this matter under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and venue is proper in the Lowell District Court because the acts and omissions giving rise to this cause of action occurred at the HomeGoods Plus store located at 1230 Main St, Lowell, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On September 20, 2023, at approximately [time not known to Plaintiff], Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of the HomeGoods Plus store located at 1230 Main St, Lowell, MA, as a business invitee, browsing kitchen goods.

5. At that location the Defendant maintained and displayed heavy boxes of appliances stacked high on store shelving—approximately five or six boxes high—without any restraining straps, barriers, or other safety devices to prevent boxes from falling from an upper shelf.

6. Another customer, while pushing a shopping cart down the same aisle, made ordinary contact with one of the lower shelves. The contact was not forceful—was a normal, incidental bump that one would reasonably expect in a busy retail aisle.

7. As a result of the way Defendant had stored, stacked, and secured (or failed to secure) the heavy boxes, a large boxed toaster-oven fell from near the top of the shelving and struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and the side of her head.

8. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a severe headache. The store manager came to the scene, prepared an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon. Plaintiff accepted medical attention later that evening because her symptoms worsened.

9. On the evening of September 20, 2023, Plaintiff sought care at the emergency department, where she was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

10. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500.00 in medical expenses to date in reasonable and necessary treatment for injuries sustained as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

11. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff, who works as a delivery driver, missed several days of work and lost approximately $1,200.00 in earnings. Plaintiff also missed participation in her weekly soccer league for approximately one month.

12. Plaintiff continues to suffer from pain, discomfort, inconvenience, nervousness, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life and has incurred other economic and noneconomic losses described below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee on Defendant’s premises, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, inspection, and storage of merchandise and to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. This duty included the obligation to store heavy merchandise safely, to use reasonable restraints or barriers where necessary, to warn customers of unsafe conditions, and to take reasonable steps to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm to invitees.

15. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. Storing heavy boxed appliances stacked dangerously high on shelving without appropriate restraints, barriers, or other reasonably necessary safety measures;
    b. Failing to use reasonable care in the inspection and maintenance of the shelving and stacked merchandise on its premises;
    c. Failing to warn invitees, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition posed by the unsecured high stacks of heavy boxes;
    d. Failing to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm that could result from an ordinary bump to lower shelving in a retail aisle.

16. Defendant’s breaches were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, including but not limited to the concussion and shoulder strain diagnosed by medical professionals at the emergency department on September 20, 2023.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:
    a. Past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proved at trial (approximately $2,500.00 to date);
    b. Past lost wages of approximately $1,200.00 and potential future lost earnings to be proved at trial;
    c. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic losses in an amount to be determined at trial;
    d. Incidental and consequential damages arising from the injuries described herein.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hall respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant HomeGoods Plus as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses in an amount sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for her reasonable and necessary medical care and treatment (approximately $2,500.00 in medical bills to date, with future medical costs to be proven at trial);

B. Awarding damages for past and future lost wages and lost earning capacity (approximately $1,200.00 lost wages to date, with any future lost earnings to be proven at trial);

C. Awarding damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined at trial;

D. Awarding costs, expenses, and interest allowable by law;

E. Awarding such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

I hereby certify that on this date I will cause a true copy of this Complaint to be served on the Defendant in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and the applicable provisions of law.
