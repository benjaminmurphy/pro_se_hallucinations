  "elements": {
    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant is owner/occupant of the property with a large branch overhanging the public sidewalk and expressly pleads Defendant owed a duty to users of the sidewalk to inspect, maintain, remove, trim, secure, or otherwise address hazardous branches. These factual allegations adequately establish a duty of care."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads that the major branch was visibly cracked and droopy for a long period, neighbors informed Defendant, Defendant acknowledged the problem and promised to address it but failed to inspect, remove, secure, or otherwise mitigate the hazard. Those factual allegations adequately plead a breach of the asserted duty."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the cracked branch separated and fell from the tree and struck Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the falling branch which in turn resulted from Defendant\u2019s failure to inspect/maintain/remove the known hazardous branch. Those allegations sufficiently plead that the injury would not have occurred but for Defendant\u2019s failure to remedy the hazardous condition."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the fall of a visibly cracked major branch overhanging a public sidewalk was a foreseeable consequence of failing to inspect and remedy the hazard, and ties Defendant\u2019s breach to the specific, foreseeable harm (branch falling and striking a passerby). Those factual allegations adequately plead proximate causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint specifies physical injuries (shoulder strain, bruises), medical treatment and approximately $3,500 in medical expenses, and approximately $600 in lost wages, plus claims for pain and suffering and other losses. These allegations adequately plead actual damages."
