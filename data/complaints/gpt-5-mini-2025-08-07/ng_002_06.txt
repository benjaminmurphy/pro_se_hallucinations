Mark Thompson,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE
(Jury Trial Demanded)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff" or "Ms. Johnson") is an individual and a resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information for service and correspondence is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is an adult individual believed to reside in or near Newton, Massachusetts, and at all times relevant owned, controlled, and exercised custody over a large dog that Defendant allowed to run off-leash in Whiting Park.

1.3 Jurisdiction is proper in the Newton District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

1.4 Venue is proper in Newton District Court because the cause of action arose in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Statement of Facts
2.1 On April 15, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging along a marked pedestrian jogging path inside Whiting Park, located in Newton, Massachusetts.

2.2 At the relevant time, Whiting Park posted visible signs stating that dogs must be kept on leashes.

2.3 Defendant is a person who, on a regular basis, allowed a large dog under his care to run loose in the park contrary to the posted leash requirement. On April 15, 2023, Defendant was present in Whiting Park with the dog. Defendant had a leash but was holding it over his shoulder and not attached to the dog. Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away, talking with friends, when the incident occurred.

2.4 Without warning or provocation, Defendant’s dog suddenly charged toward Plaintiff while barking loudly. Plaintiff reasonably feared the dog would bite or attack her.

2.5 To avoid the dog and the threatened attack, Plaintiff swerved off the paved jogging path onto adjacent ground. While doing so she tripped over a protruding tree root concealed near the edge of the path, fell down a small embankment, and suffered an acute fracture of her wrist.

2.6 The dog did not bite or physically touch Plaintiff; the dog stopped when Plaintiff fell and Defendant then called the dog back.

2.7 Several other joggers witnessed the incident and observed Defendant's dog running loose and charging at Plaintiff while Defendant held the leash over his shoulder and stood some distance away.

2.8 As a direct and proximate result of the fall caused by avoiding Defendant’s loose, charging dog, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries including a broken wrist that required immediate medical care. Plaintiff presented to a hospital emergency department and incurred approximately $5,200 in medical expenses related to diagnosis and treatment of her wrist fracture. Plaintiff was required to wear a brace for several weeks, missed time from work resulting in lost wages of approximately $2,000, and missed a recital for which she had been preparing, suffering additional non-economic losses.

2.9 Plaintiff preserved the scene and the witnesses are available for identification and testimony. All conditions precedent to this action have been performed or have occurred.

3. Negligence — General Allegations
3.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1.1 through 2.9 as if fully set forth herein.

3.2 At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of lawful park users such as Plaintiff. This duty included the duty to control and restrain his dog, to follow and enforce park leash rules, and otherwise to act reasonably under the circumstances so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others.

3.3 Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, inter alia: (a) failing to keep his dog on a leash as required by posted park rules; (b) permitting the dog to run loose and approach and charge at Plaintiff while Defendant was inattentive and failed to restrain or control the dog; (c) failing to warn Plaintiff or others of the dog’s dangerous behavior; and (d) otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent dog owner would under the circumstances.

3.4 Defendant’s negligent conduct was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages; but for Defendant’s allowing the dog to run loose and charge at Plaintiff, Plaintiff would not have been forced off the path, would not have tripped over the tree root, and would not have suffered the wrist fracture and other losses.

3.5 Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligent failure to control his dog. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position would have anticipated that allowing a large dog to run loose and to charge at a path user could cause the user to take evasive action, fall, and suffer injury.

4. Count I — Negligence (Against Defendant Mark Thompson)
4.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1.1 through 3.5 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2 Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to act reasonably in controlling his dog and to comply with applicable leash rules and common-law obligations to prevent harm to others.

4.3 Defendant breached that duty by permitting his dog to run at large in the park, by allowing it to charge toward and threaten Plaintiff while Defendant was inattentive and not restraining the dog, and by failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the risk of harm to Plaintiff and other lawful park users.

4.4 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury (a broken wrist), incurred medical expenses, lost wages, loss of enjoyment and impairment of activities (including missing a piano recital), and other economic and non-economic damages in amounts to be proven at trial.

4.5 Plaintiff seeks damages for all her losses and further relief permitted by law.

5. Damages
5.1 As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and claims the following damages:
    (a) past medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,200 (and ongoing medical expenses as proven at trial);
    (b) past lost wages in the approximate amount of $2,000 (and future lost earnings if any, to be proven at trial);
    (c) pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in amounts to be proven at trial;
    (d) costs of suit and statutory interest; and
    (e) such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

6. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Thompson as follows:
    A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other general and special damages permitted by law;
    B. Costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent allowed by law (Plaintiff currently proceeding pro se);
    C. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
    D. Trial by jury on all issues so triable; and
    E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

7. Demand for Jury Trial
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Emily Johnson
