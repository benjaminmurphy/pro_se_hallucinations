Even though the excerpt is the Chief Judge\u2019s dissent criticizing this expansion, the case as a whole (the majority, joined by Cardozo, J.) does exactly what the parenthetical states: it broadens duty principles beyond inherently dangerous products and immediate vendees. Thus, citing MacPherson for expansion of duty principles is accurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "I think that these rulings, which have been approved by the Appellate Division, extend the liability of the vendor of a manufactured article further than any case which has yet received the sanction of this court.. It has heretofore been held in this state that the liability of the vendor of a manufactured article for negligence arising out of the existence of defects therein does not extend to strangers injured in consequence of such defects but is confined to the immediate vendee."

Cardozo explicitly rejects a pure proximate-cause/remoteness analysis and instead grounds liability in whether the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim within the \u2018orbit of danger.\u2019 This makes Palsgraf a leading case on foreseeability as a component of proximate cause and duty in negligence law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension\u2026 These cases aside, wrong is defined in terms of the natural or probable, at least when unintentional\u2026 The range of reasonable apprehension is at times a question for the court, and at times, if varying inferences are possible, a question for the jury.\u201d"

However, the provided text is from Justice Burke\u2019s dissent, which expressly rejects the majority\u2019s move to a general negligence duty and instead defends the traditional invitee/licensee/trespasser distinctions. A dissent does not establish binding legal principles and, in fact, argues against the proposition for which the case is cited, so this excerpt does not support the claimed proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The unfortunate alternative, it appears to me, is the route taken by the majority in their opinion in this case; that such issues are to be decided on a case by case basis under the application of the basic law of negligence, bereft of the guiding principles and precedent which the law has heretofore attached by virtue of the relationship of the parties to one another.\""
