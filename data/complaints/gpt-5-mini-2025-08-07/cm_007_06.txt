James Greene
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   - Plaintiff: Samantha Greene, residing at [address on file with Court], telephone (617) 555-0123, email psm1443@gmail.com.
   - Defendant: James Greene, residing at [address on file with Court].
   - Minor child: Emily Greene, born [DOB withheld; age 12 as of complaint].
   - This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody of the minor child pursuant to Massachusetts statutory law governing divorce, custody and family matters and by virtue of the prior judgment entered in this Court on May 15, 2018 (the “2018 Order”), which established the parties’ custodial arrangement. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court.

2. Nature of Action
   - This is a Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order entered May 15, 2018. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the physical custody schedule and related orders to protect the safety and welfare of the minor child and to reflect a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Order.

3. Prior Orders
   - On May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order that awarded the parties 50/50 physical custody of the minor child, Emily Greene, on an alternating-week schedule (one week with Plaintiff, one week with Defendant).

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   - Since the entry of the 2018 Order, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has materially and adversely affected his physical ability to care for the minor child. (The diagnosis and treating physician’s recommendations are described below.)
   - The Defendant has experienced multiple falls in his home since 2023 and has been advised by his treating physician that he should not be left alone with the minor child in situations involving stairs, transfers, or other situations requiring a quick physical response.
   - Despite medical advice and the Defendant’s documented physical limitations, the Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the prior alternating-week 50/50 schedule and, at times, relies on the minor child—who is twelve (12) years old—to assist him with transfers (for example, helping move him from his wheelchair to bed) and to fetch items for him.
   - The Defendant’s falls and need for physical assistance have occurred on multiple occasions while the minor child was present in the Defendant’s care, creating a risk of physical harm to the child and placing caregiving responsibilities on the child that are inappropriate given her age.
   - The change in the Defendant’s health and functional capacity, and the Defendant’s continued insistence on maintaining the former equal shared-week schedule despite medical contraindications, constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since the Court entered the 2018 Order.

5. Best Interests of the Child
   - The requested modification is in the best interests of the minor child. The minor child’s safety, welfare, and developmental needs require a custody arrangement that does not expose her to undue risk of injury or require her to perform caregiving tasks beyond what is appropriate for a child her age.
   - The minor child historically had stable routines and school and extracurricular participation while on the alternating-week schedule; continuation of a safe, predictable routine under a modified custodial schedule with the Plaintiff as primary residential custodian will promote the child’s physical safety, emotional wellbeing, and educational stability.
   - The Plaintiff is willing to facilitate and encourage ongoing meaningful parenting time between the Defendant and the minor child to the extent consistent with the child’s safety and the Defendant’s demonstrated ability to care for the child safely.

6. Requested Relief
   Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
   A. Find that a substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2018 Order sufficient to warrant modification of the custodial arrangement;
   B. Modify the 2018 Order to award primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Greene, to the Plaintiff, Samantha Greene;
   C. Establish a parenting time schedule for the Defendant that provides for reasonable, ongoing contact consistent with the child’s safety and the Defendant’s capabilities (for example, weekend parenting time, supervised exchanges, daytime visits, or other limited schedule as the Court deems appropriate), and expressly authorize the Court, if appropriate, to order supervised visitation or exchanges at a neutral public place or supervised by a third party until the Defendant can demonstrate, by competent medical evidence, that he can safely care for the child unsupervised;
   D. Prohibit the minor child from performing personal-care or physically assisting tasks for the Defendant (including transfers, lifting, or other activities that the child reasonably should not be required to perform) and order the Defendant to obtain appropriate in-home care or other assistance for activities of daily living when the child is present with him;
   E. Order that any exchanges of the minor child take place at safe, public locations or as otherwise ordered by the Court, and institute reasonable procedures to ensure the child’s safety during exchanges (including, if warranted, neutral third-party exchange or supervised exchanges);
   F. Require the Defendant to provide the Plaintiff and the Court with current medical records and written notice of the Defendant’s treating physician(s) and to sign releases sufficient to permit the parties and the Court to receive medical information relevant to the Defendant’s ability to parent safely;
   G. Schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and, if the Court deems appropriate based on the evidence presented, enter a temporary order modifying custody and parenting time pending final hearing to protect the child’s safety;
   H. Award the Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, if the Court finds such relief appropriate;
   I. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the welfare, health and safety of the minor child.

7. Legal Basis (General)
   - This Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify prior orders affecting custody and visitation where there has been a material change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.
   - The Plaintiff will rely at hearing on evidence of: (a) the Defendant’s medical diagnosis and treating physician’s recommendations; (b) documented incidents of falls and other events demonstrating risk to the child; (c) testimony from the minor child and witnesses as appropriate; (d) any relevant medical, school, or other records; and (e) the child’s best interests considering health, safety, and welfare.

8. Prayer for Relief
   WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Court enter an order:
   1. Finding that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order;
   2. Modifying the custody order to award primary physical custody of Emily Greene to Samantha Greene;
   3. Establishing a safe, specific parenting time schedule for Defendant consistent with the child’s safety and with any necessary supervision or protections;
   4. Restricting the minor child from performing caregiving or personal-assistance tasks for the Defendant and ordering the Defendant to obtain appropriate assistance for activities of daily living when the child is present; and
   5. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including costs and attorneys’ fees.

Date: December 1, 2025
