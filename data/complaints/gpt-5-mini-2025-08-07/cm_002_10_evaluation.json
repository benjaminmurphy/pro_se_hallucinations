The plurality rejects a regime in which a judge may substitute his or her judgment for that of a fit parent based solely on a free\u2011floating best\u2011interest test, and insists that a fit parent\u2019s determination receive \u201cspecial weight.\u201d This aligns with citing Troxel as authority on parental rights and deference to fit parental decision\u2011making in custody/visitation contexts that must then be integrated with applicable Massachusetts statutes and best\u2011interest standards.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cFirst, the Troxels did not allege, and no court has found, that Granville was an unfit parent. That aspect of the case is important, for there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children. \u2026 Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.\u201d"
