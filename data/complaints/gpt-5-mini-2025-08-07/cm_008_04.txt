Michael Johnson
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and appearances
- Plaintiff: Jessica Lee, primary residential parent of the minor child, with telephone (617) 555-0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com. Plaintiff requests that all notices, orders, and papers be sent to the email address provided and to the Probate and Family Court at which this Complaint is filed.
- Defendant: Michael Johnson, non-residential parent.

2. Jurisdiction and venue
- This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C). The existing custody judgment was entered in this Court on March 15, 2022. The child subject to this action is Emma Johnson, born 2015 (age 10), who resides with the Plaintiff in Norfolk County. Venue is proper in Norfolk Probate and Family Court.

3. Existing order
- On March 15, 2022, this Court entered a judgment providing shared legal custody of Emma Johnson, with Jessica Lee designated as the primary residential parent. The order awarded Michael Johnson substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnights, and required cooperation between the parties on school matters and mutual notification regarding the child’s health and education.

4. Nature of action
- Plaintiff brings this action to modify the March 15, 2022 custody order because there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests and welfare of Emma Johnson since entry of that order. Plaintiff seeks (a) an order granting Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding school attendance and related educational issues, or, alternatively, (b) a reduction or reconfiguration of Defendant’s parenting time that includes the elimination or restriction of Sunday-night overnights on school nights; and (c) such further relief as the Court deems necessary to protect the child’s best interests.

5. Legal standard
- Under Massachusetts law, a parent seeking modification of a prior custody order must show a material and substantial change of circumstances since entry of the order that affects the child’s welfare and warrants modification in the child’s best interest. See, e.g., relevant Massachusetts authority interpreting custody modification and best-interest standards (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children); and Massachusetts caselaw interpreting the “material change” and best-interests standards).

6. Allegations of material and substantial change in circumstances
Plaintiff alleges as follows (each allegation is made based on Plaintiff’s personal knowledge except where indicated otherwise):

a. School attendance problems arising from Defendant’s conduct
- Over the past twelve (12) months (from approximately December 2024 through the present), following time the child spends with Defendant on weekends, Defendant has routinely kept Emma home from school on Monday mornings, stating that she “needs a mental health day.”
- These Monday absences occur after a pattern of Defendant’s weekend parenting time and are not supported by any written notes or medical documentation. Defendant has not provided physician or mental health provider notes excusing the absences when asked.
- Plaintiff has repeatedly objected to these unexcused absences and has requested Defendant to ensure the child has school attendance on Mondays, but Defendant has continued the practice despite school truancy warnings.

b. Impact on the child’s education and welfare
- As a direct result of the repeated Monday absences and Defendant’s refusal to cooperate in ensuring attendance, the school has issued truancy warnings to Plaintiff and has documented attendance concerns.
- Emma’s grades and standardized test scores have declined over the past academic year. Emma has missed scheduled tutoring sessions and other school-related supports when those sessions fall during Defendant’s weekend parenting time because Defendant has refused to take her to tutoring.
- The decline in academic performance, the school’s attendance concerns, and the denial of tutoring support constitute a change in circumstances materially affecting Emma’s educational welfare and daily routines as contemplated by the original custody order.

c. Defendant’s failure to cooperate on school matters
- The existing order requires cooperation between the parties on school matters and mutual communication regarding the child’s health and education. Defendant has repeatedly failed to cooperate: he keeps Emma home without documented medical excuses, fails to transport her to tutoring appointments during his parenting time, and does not timely inform Plaintiff of school-related matters that occur during his time with the child.
- Defendant’s actions have frustrated the spirit and specific directives of the Court’s March 15, 2022 order regarding cooperation on school matters.

7. Requested modification and proposed temporary relief
- Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order modifying the March 15, 2022 custody order as follows:
  a. Primary requested modification (preferred): Amend the legal custody provisions to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority for school attendance, daily education-related schedules, and educational supports (e.g., tutoring) when the parties cannot agree promptly in writing. Such authority shall include the power to determine whether the child attends school on days following Defendant’s parenting time and to schedule and require tutoring and other academic interventions deemed appropriate by the Plaintiff, the child’s teachers, and educational professionals.
  b. Alternatively, if the Court is not prepared to grant sole final decision-making authority, modify the parenting time schedule to eliminate or significantly restrict Sunday-night overnights on school nights and otherwise ensure that Defendant’s parenting time does not interfere with Monday morning school attendance or scheduled tutoring; e.g., restrict Defendant’s regular parenting time to end Saturday evenings on weeks preceding school days or to require that any Sunday parenting time conclude at a time that allows the child to attend school the next morning.
  c. Require that any further absences from school resulting from parenting time be supported by contemporaneous written documentation from a licensed medical or mental health professional acceptable to the school and provided to the Plaintiff within 24 hours of the absence.
  d. Order that Defendant facilitate and attend scheduled tutoring or other educational appointments during his parenting time when those appointments are necessary or agreed-upon, or else forfeit that portion of parenting time and allow make-up time only as the Court orders.
  e. Order the parties to participate in a Court-ordered parent coordination process (or mediation) limited to disputes over school attendance and tutoring, and/or appoint a Guardian ad Litem or educational advocate if the Court deems it necessary to protect the child’s educational welfare.
  f. Any other temporary relief the Court finds appropriate, including temporary modification of parenting time pending final hearing to prevent further harm to the child’s education.

8. Basis for relief
- The requested relief is necessary to protect Emma’s best interests and to implement the parties’ original agreement’s requirement of cooperation on school matters. The Defendant’s repeated, unexcused removal of the child from school on Mondays following his parenting time, refusal to cooperate with necessary tutoring, and failure to provide medical documentation for absences constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since issuance of the March 15, 2022 order and justify modification under Massachusetts law.

9. Demand for relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the March 15, 2022 custody order that affects the welfare of Emma Johnson;
b. Modify the March 15, 2022 custody order as requested in Paragraph 7 (or to the extent the Court finds appropriate, enter such other orders modifying legal custody and/or parenting time as are necessary to protect the child’s educational welfare);
c. Issue such temporary emergency orders as are necessary to protect the child’s school attendance and academic progress pending final hearing, including but not limited to temporary restriction or modification of Sunday-night overnights and an order requiring written medical documentation for any future absences attributable to Defendant;
d. Order parent coordination, mediation, appointment of a Guardian ad Litem, or an educational evaluator/advocate if the Court determines one is necessary;
e. Award Plaintiff costs, fees, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper; and
f. Schedule this matter for a prompt hearing and any interim relief hearing requested by Plaintiff.

10. Certification
- Plaintiff certifies pursuant to applicable court rules that this complaint is brought in good faith and that the factual allegations set forth herein are true to the best of Plaintiff’s knowledge and belief.

Legal authorities (representative statutes and Massachusetts authorities addressing custody modification, best-interests of the child, parental decision-making, and child welfare). Plaintiff cites the following statutes and authorities in support of the requested relief:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (general provisions relating to children and schools, including statutory responsibilities and truancy procedures);
- Relevant principles governing custody modification and best-interests determinations as articulated in Massachusetts case law (see, e.g., decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court addressing the required showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and the child’s best interests); see also applicable Probate and Family Court rules governing custody modification and temporary relief.

(Please note: Plaintiff intends to rely on statutory and case law authority concerning modification of custody orders, material change in circumstances, parental responsibility for education, and the court’s authority to enter temporary orders and appoint professionals to assist the Court. Plaintiff will supply citation-specific authorities and supporting legal briefs at or before hearing as may be required by the Court.)
