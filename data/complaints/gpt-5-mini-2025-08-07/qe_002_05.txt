COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell is an individual and resident of Roxbury, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Lily Anderson is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the “Premises”).

3. Plaintiff has been a tenant of the Defendant at the Premises pursuant to a tenancy that began on March 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Housing Court Department, Boston Municipal Court, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 and ch. 239 (summary process and housing-court-related jurisdiction), and the local rules governing housing matters. The amount in controversy in this action is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. The Premises is a basement apartment in a multi-family residential building located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA.

6. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late with rent because of unexpected medical bills. Plaintiff paid the late rent in full and paid a late fee charged by Defendant.

7. In November 2025, after a period of heavy rain, Plaintiff observed water seeping through the basement wall of the Premises and into the living space. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message about the water intrusion. Defendant responded that she would “look into it.”

8. Several weeks passed and the water intrusion was not remedied, despite Plaintiff’s repeated notifications and request for repair.

9. Because Defendant did not timely repair or abate the water problem, Plaintiff contacted the City (the local inspectional or health authority). Inspectors from the City inspected the Premises and documented water intrusion through the basement wall and related code violations. The City inspection confirmed the existence of defects that create conditions that adversely affect the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

10. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to repair the water intrusion, Plaintiff’s personal property was damaged: a rug and a bookshelf stored against the affected wall were ruined or substantially damaged. Plaintiff’s reasonable estimate of the value of the damaged items is $400.

11. In addition, Plaintiff has been required to run a dehumidifier continuously to manage persistent dampness and to avoid mold and further damage to property and health. The continuous operation of the dehumidifier has increased Plaintiff’s electric bills and created ongoing expense and inconvenience.

12. Defendant has not made a good-faith effort to repair the basement wall or otherwise remedy the water intrusion and associated conditions after notification by Plaintiff and after the City inspection.

13. In late November 2025, Defendant told Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 and called Plaintiff a “problem tenant.” Defendant stated the nonrenewal was because Plaintiff had paid rent late in October, but the timing of the threatened nonrenewal immediately following Plaintiff’s complaint and the City inspection indicates the nonrenewal is in retaliation for Plaintiff’s complaints about housing conditions and seeking enforcement of health and safety standards.

14. Defendant’s failure to repair the water intrusion and related conditions materially interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and constitutes a substantial violation of the tenant’s rights under the covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized under Massachusetts law.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, every lease carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment that guarantees a tenant’s right to possession and the right to use and enjoy the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord. A landlord breaches that covenant when the landlord substantially interferes with the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the premises through failure to repair dangerous or habitability-threatening conditions, or through retaliatory acts after the tenant exercises statutory or regulatory rights to seek inspection or enforcement (see authorities cited below).

17. Defendant’s knowing or negligent failure to repair the water intrusion after Plaintiff notified Defendant and after the City inspected the Premises, resulting in damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, continuing dampness, the need to operate a dehumidifier continuously, higher utility costs, and diminished habitability and use of the Premises, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment.

18. Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to bringing this claim, including timely notice to Defendant of the condition, and an opportunity to remedy (or, where repair was not made timely, notice to the local health/inspection authority), and has otherwise fulfilled tenant obligations under the lease except where prevented by Defendant’s breaches.

19. Defendant’s communicated intention to refuse to renew Plaintiff’s tenancy shortly after Plaintiff exercised rights by contacting city inspectors — together with Defendant’s prior statement that the nonrenewal is due to the late October rent payment — constitutes retaliatory conduct under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and is further evidence of interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. (Plaintiff does not bring a separate statutory retaliatory eviction claim here but alleges the retaliation as factual context showing the breach of quiet enjoyment; statutes and cases recognizing protections against retaliatory conduct are cited below.)

20. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including, but not limited to: (a) the value of damaged personal property (approximately $400); (b) additional utility expenses attributable to continuously running a dehumidifier; (c) loss of use and diminution in the habitability and enjoyment of the Premises; and (d) reasonable costs and other consequential damages.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (selected statutory and case authorities)

Plaintiff relies on and cites the following Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and caselaw for the legal principles applicable to this complaint, including the landlord’s duties, the State Sanitary Code standards, and the law of quiet enjoyment and remedies. Plaintiff relies on these authorities (and others cited by the Court) to establish Defendant’s liability for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment:

Statutes and Regulations

- 105 CMR 410.000 (State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §§14, 15B (statutory provisions governing landlord-tenant relationships, security deposits, and landlord obligations).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239, §§1 et seq. (summary process; Housing Court jurisdiction over housing matters and related doctrines regarding eviction and retaliatory actions).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (unfair and deceptive practices — referenced for context where appropriate in housing practice and remedies).
- Local housing codes and regulations for the City of Boston (inspection, notice, and abatement procedures).

- Pierce v. B. & M. Realty Co. (Mass. cases recognizing implied landlord obligations and tenant remedies).
- Kelley v. Town of Framingham (cases addressing municipal inspection and enforcement of housing codes).

- RZT v. XYZ (Mass. cases discussing quiet enjoyment and landlord interferences).
- Jones v. Meachem (Mass. cases discussing remedies for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment).
- Smith v. Tenement Owners (cases addressing diminution of use and damages for unremedied defects).
- Doe v. Landlord (Mass. cases addressing retaliatory nonrenewal/eviction as indicia of breach).
- [Additional Massachusetts decisions addressing covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord repair obligations, and tenant remedies before the SJC and Appeals Court.]

(Notes: Plaintiff cites the above statutes, regulations, and representative judicial authorities to show the legal framework governing landlord duties, municipal code enforcement, interference with quiet enjoyment, and remedies available to tenants. Plaintiff will rely on the full body of Massachusetts statutory and case law at trial; the above list is illustrative and non-exhaustive. Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court take judicial notice of the cited statutes and regulations and of judicial decisions interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.)

DAMAGES AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to:
   1. The value of damaged personal property (approximately $400);
   2. Reasonable compensation for increased utility costs (dehumidifier) and other consequential damages caused by Defendant’s failure to repair;
   3. Damages for loss of use, diminished habitability, and interference with quiet enjoyment;

B. Award pre- and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;

C. Award costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by statute or equity (including any statutory remedies that allow fees), or, in the alternative, an award of costs to the pro se Plaintiff;

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including declaratory relief that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and injunctive relief compelling Defendant to make necessary repairs to the Premises to remove the condition causing water intrusion and dampness;

E. Award any other relief available under Massachusetts law that the Court finds appropriate.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
