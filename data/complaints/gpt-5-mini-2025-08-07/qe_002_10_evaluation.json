Although it approvingly quotes Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway from Massachusetts, it uses that case to support a contract-based habitability warranty and rent abatement, not to discuss quiet enjoyment or Massachusetts remedies for persistent defects. Therefore, it cannot be cited as Massachusetts caselaw recognizing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment on these facts.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The modern view favors a new approach which recognizes \u2022 that a lease is essentially a contract between the landlord and the tenant wherein the landlord promises to deliver and maintain the demised premises in habitable condition and the tenant promises to pay rent for such habitable premises. These promises constitute interdependent and mutual considerations. Thus, the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent is predicated on the landlord\u2019s obligation to deliver and maintain the premises in habitable condition. Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 198, 293 N.E.2d 831, 842 (1973)."
