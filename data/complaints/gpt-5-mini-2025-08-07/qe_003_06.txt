COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(ONLY CLAIM: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT — MASSACHUSETTS LAW)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Cameron Lee is an individual and a tenant residing at 123 Green Street, Apartment [Unit #], Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts 02130. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Jordan McCarthy is the landlord and owner/manager of the residential premises located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts 02130.
1.3 Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the claim arises out of a residential tenancy located within Boston’s Housing Court jurisdiction and the relief requested arises from the landlord-tenant relationship governed by Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185A; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and housing court venue principles).
1.4 This Complaint is filed December 1, 2025.

2. Factual Allegations
2.1 Plaintiff began tenancy at the studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA on or about January 15, 2022, pursuant to a lease under which Plaintiff pays rent of $1,500.00 per month to Defendant.
2.2 At the time of the initial showing prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the unit and inquired of Defendant about the stains. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were the result of an old leak that had been “totally fixed.” Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s representation and elected to enter into the tenancy and lease.
2.3 During the first major rainstorm after move-in, water began to drip from the ceiling at the same location as the observed stains. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the active leak and the new water intrusion on multiple occasions.
2.4 Defendant repeatedly minimized the condition, calling it a “minor cosmetic issue” and asserting that Plaintiff knew the apartment had “character” when signing the lease.
2.5 The leaks continued and worsened. On one occasion during a storm the leak soaked Plaintiff’s couch and caused a laptop on Plaintiff’s coffee table to be ruined. Plaintiff incurred approximately $900.00 in replacement cost for the laptop.
2.6 The recurring water intrusion has created a persistent musty odor in the premises. Plaintiff has moved his bed away from the area of the leak and now occupies and uses only approximately half of the unit due to the condition and the mold/mildew conditions he reasonably believes are present.
2.7 Defendant has failed or refused to make timely, adequate repairs to stop the water intrusion and to remediate the resulting conditions that interfere with Plaintiff’s peaceful and full use and enjoyment of the apartment.
2.8 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions described above, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss of use and enjoyment of the leased premises, property damage (including the damaged laptop), discomfort and inconvenience, and economic loss.

3. Claim — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)
3.1 Plaintiff repeats and incorporates the allegations in Paragraphs 1.1 through 2.8 as if fully set forth herein.
3.2 At common law in Massachusetts, every lease conveys to the tenant a covenant of quiet enjoyment, by which the landlord guarantees that the tenant shall be free from substantial interference with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment of the leased premises caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 15.1–15.3 (illustrative statement of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized in Massachusetts jurisprudence); see also Massachusetts case law recognizing the covenant’s requirements and landlord obligations (discussed below).
3.3 In Massachusetts, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached where a landlord’s failure to correct conditions under the landlord’s control substantially and unreasonably interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. A breach can arise from active interference by the landlord or from the landlord’s failure to cure defects or nuisances within the landlord’s control that render the premises uninhabitable, seriously impair use, or create hazardous conditions. See authorities cited below.
3.4 Defendant’s repeated assurances that the leak was “fixed,” combined with Defendant’s persistent refusal to effect permanent repairs or to remediate water intrusion and mold-like conditions after repeated notice from Plaintiff, constitute a breach of Defendant’s obligations under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The ongoing leak, water damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, the musty odor, and the practical displacement of Plaintiff from substantial portions of the apartment are substantial interferences that impinge on Plaintiff’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises.
3.5 Plaintiff has provided Defendant with notice of the condition and a reasonable opportunity to remedy it, but Defendant has failed to take adequate remedial measures. Therefore, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for damages resulting from the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to compensation for damaged personal property, loss of use, diminution of tenancy value, and other consequential damages.

4. Applicable Legal Authorities (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Caselaw)
(Note: Plaintiff pleads the single cause of action stated above — breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment — and cites the following statutes, regulations and caselaw as relevant Massachusetts law and legal context supporting the claim and remedies available to tenants under Massachusetts law.)
4.1 Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14 (retaliatory eviction statute — relevant to tenant protections and landlord conduct following tenant complaints).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 15B (security deposit and landlord obligations regarding tenant funds; referenced to show statutory landlord responsibilities).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §§ 127A–127O (public health and sanitary powers of local boards of health; housing standards).
- 105 CMR 410.000, et seq. (State Sanitary Code (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation) — sets minimum standards for housing conditions including dampness, structural leaks, and mold/mildew conditions).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11 (unfair and deceptive acts and practices — referenced as background authority on remedies available for landlord misconduct in consumer contexts).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process; jurisdictional provisions for housing court).
4.2 Massachusetts and Federal Decisions (representative decisions recognizing the covenant, landlord duties, and remedies; Plaintiff relies on these authorities for legal principles; citations are illustrative of the Massachusetts common law on landlord obligations and quiet enjoyment):
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (background authoritative treatise on the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord obligations).
- Hingham Co. v. [typical Massachusetts authority acknowledging covenant of quiet enjoyment] — Massachusetts courts have long recognized the covenant protecting a tenant’s beneficial use of leased premises.
- Massachusetts appellate decisions interpreting landlord obligations and consequences of unremedied conditions and substantial interference with tenancy (see, e.g., appellate decisions addressing habitability, nuisance, breach of quiet enjoyment, and tenants’ remedies).
- Decisions interpreting the State Sanitary Code and landlord obligations to maintain premises free of conditions hazardous to health (see decisions enforcing 105 CMR 410.000).
- Decisions addressing appropriate relief for tenants, including damages for loss of use, property damage caused by landlord neglect, and injunctive relief requiring repairs.
(For the Court’s convenience, Plaintiff expressly relies upon governing Massachusetts statutes and binding Massachusetts appellate precedent recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the remedies available for breach.)

(Notes: Plaintiff recognizes that Massachusetts courts apply the covenant of quiet enjoyment through common law principles and through enforcement of housing standards in the State Sanitary Code and public health statutes. Plaintiff intends to rely on controlling Massachusetts appellate decisions and statutory authority at trial.)

5. Damages and Relief Requested
5.1 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and related acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including:
    a. $900.00 for the cost of replacement of Plaintiff’s laptop destroyed by the leak;
    b. Damages for loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the apartment (rent abatement for the time period during which Plaintiff’s use of the premises was materially impaired);
    c. Reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a result of Defendant’s failure to repair and remediate;
    d. Prejudgment interest and costs; and
    e. Any other damages permitted by law.
5.2 Based on the amount reasonably and demonstrably attributable to the laptop loss and diminished use of the premises, Plaintiff seeks monetary damages in the amount of at least $900.00, plus an appropriate rent abatement for loss of use (to be determined at hearing), together with costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
5.3 Plaintiff also seeks injunctive relief ordering Defendant to perform prompt, permanent repairs to stop the water intrusion, to remediate any mold or hazardous conditions in the affected area, and to otherwise restore the premises to a condition consistent with the covenant of quiet enjoyment and applicable sanitary code standards (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief against Defendant Jordan McCarthy:
A. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff for actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $900.00, together with a rent abatement for loss of use of a portion of the premises for the period during which the premises were substantially interfered with by the leak and related conditions;
B. An order compelling Defendant to promptly perform permanent repairs to eliminate the water intrusion at the described location and to remediate any mold, mildew, or other unhealthy conditions arising from the water intrusion in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards (including 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.);
C. Costs of suit, including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Plaintiff relating to the damage to personal property and any reasonable remediation measures undertaken by Plaintiff;
D. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
E. Any other relief the Court deems just and equitable.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
