    "existing_custody_order": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint identifies a Prior Order entered May 15, 2018 in this Court, describes its terms (primary physical custody to Plaintiff, limited weekday visits and one Sunday afternoon visit to Defendant, no overnights) and alleges it remains in effect (\u00b6\u00b62.1, 3.1\u20133.2)."
    },
    "specific_modification_sought": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint requests concrete changes: permit Defendant regular overnight parenting time (examples given), consolidate/lengthen parenting periods to eliminate school\u2011night exchanges, expand holiday/vacation/summer time, set exchange/communication protocols, and provide for transitional oversight (\u00b66.1(a)\u2013(e), \u00b68.2)."
    },
    "material_substantial_change": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads factual changes since 2018: Defendant now has separate housing and a bedroom suitable for the Child, the Child is older (3 \u2192 8) with changed developmental/school needs, the current short\u2011visit routing disrupts homework/bedtime and causes exhaustion, the Child expresses a consistent preference, and both parties agree change is appropriate (\u00b64.1\u20134.6). These are non\u2011speculative allegations of material/substantial change."
    },
    "best_interests_of_child": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint links the alleged changes to the Child\u2019s best interests: improved sleeping/study routines, reduced disruptive transfers, age\u2011appropriate parenting time, the Child\u2019s stated preference, and both parents\u2019 agreement \u2014 and expressly alleges the requested restructuring will promote the Child\u2019s stable routines and welfare (\u00b64.2\u20134.6, \u00b65.2, \u00b66.1, \u00b68.2). These factual allegations adequately plead that the modification is sought for the Child\u2019s best interests."
