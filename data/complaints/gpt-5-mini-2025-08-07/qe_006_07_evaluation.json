      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The proposition cites Green as authority on landlord responsibilities and tenant remedies regarding implied warranty of habitability, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and essential services. Green is the landmark California Supreme Court case expressly recognizing a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, tying it to maintenance of essential services and discussing its relationship to constructive eviction/quiet enjoyment and tenant rent remedies. Although it is a California, not Massachusetts, decision, it squarely supports use as \u201crecognized authority\u201d on these doctrines and landlord obligations to provide habitable premises and basic services.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe have concluded that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in this state and that the breach of such a warranty may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action. Under the implied warranty which we recognize, a residential landlord covenants that premises he leases for living quarters will be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease. This implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing condition, but it does mean that \u2018bare living requirements\u2019 must be maintained.\u201d"

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely addresses a landlord\u2019s implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, the interdependence of that warranty with the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent, and the landlord\u2019s nondelegable duty to provide essential services such as sanitation and maintenance. It also traces the evolution from the traditional covenant of quiet enjoyment/constructive eviction framework to modern warranty-of-habitability doctrine and recognizes tenants\u2019 remedial rent abatement for failure to provide essential services. Although it is a New York, not Massachusetts, case, it is correctly cited as recognized authority from another jurisdiction on these landlord obligations and tenant remedies.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cA residential lease is now effectively deemed a sale of shelter and services by the landlord who impliedly warrants: first, that the premises are fit for human habitation; second, that the condition of the premises is in accord with the uses reasonably intended by the parties; and, third, that the tenants are not subjected to any conditions endangering or detrimental to their life, health or safety\u2026 Inasmuch as the landlord is vested with the ultimate control and responsibility for the building, it is he who has a corresponding nondelegable and nonwaivable duty to maintain it. The obligation of the tenant to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord\u2019s satisfactory maintenance of the premises in habitable condition.\u201d"

It also discusses the historic constructive eviction/quiet enjoyment framework and replaces it in Vermont with a robust contract-based habitability warranty, specifying available tenant remedies such as rent abatement, withholding, repair-and-deduct, and damages for discomfort and annoyance. Although the case is from Vermont, not Massachusetts, it is accurately cited as out-of-jurisdiction authority on warranty of habitability and related landlord obligations.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Therefore, we now hold expressly that in the rental of any residential dwelling unit an implied warranty exists in the lease, whether oral or written, that the landlord will deliver over and maintain, throughout the period of the tenancy, premises that are safe, clean and fit for human habitation. This warranty of habitability is implied in tenancies for a specific period or at will. \u2026 Because we hold that the lease of a residential dwelling creates a contractual relationship between the landlord and tenant, the standard contract remedies of rescission, reformation and damages are available to the tenant when suing for breach of the implied warranty of habitability."
