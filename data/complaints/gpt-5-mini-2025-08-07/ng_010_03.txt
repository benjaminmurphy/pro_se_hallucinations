COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted by telephone at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Thomas Roberts is an individual who owns real property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201 (the "Property"). Upon information and belief, Defendant is a resident of Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

3. This action is brought in the Berkshire Superior Court under the personal injury jurisdiction of the Court. Venue is proper in Berkshire County because the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, which is located in Berkshire County.

4. This Complaint is timely filed within the applicable statute of limitations. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about July 15, 2023, at approximately [time not required for pleading], Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of the Property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

6. A large maple tree standing on or adjacent to Defendant’s Property had a major branch hanging over and above the public sidewalk. For a significant period prior to July 15, 2023, the branch displayed obvious signs of serious decay, splitting, and cracking and sagged in a manner that should have put a reasonably prudent landowner on notice of the risk it posed to persons using the sidewalk.

7. Neighbors and other persons observed and, upon information and belief, informed Defendant of the condition of the branch and urged Defendant to have the tree inspected and/or pruned or otherwise remedied. Defendant told neighbors he would "deal with it in the spring" but failed to take any corrective action prior to July 15, 2023.

8. During a routine summer thunderstorm on July 15, 2023 — not a hurricane, tornado, or other extraordinary meteorological event — the visibly compromised branch unexpectedly fractured and fell as Plaintiff walked beneath the tree carrying grocery bags.

9. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, caused her to be knocked to the ground, and resulted in physical injury.

10. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, and/or remove the dangerous branch, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain and extensive bruising, incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.00, and lost wages in the approximate amount of $600.00 for work she missed due to her injuries.

11. Plaintiff has otherwise suffered conscious pain and suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life; and has been compelled to incur other incidental and consequential economic losses as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. At all times relevant to this action, Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully using the public sidewalk, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of trees and branches on or adjacent to his property so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others.

14. Defendant breached that duty by, among other negligent acts and omissions:
    a. failing to inspect the tree and the dangerous branch in a sensible and timely manner;
    b. failing to remove, prune, or otherwise correct the visibly deteriorated and cracked branch that presented an unreasonable risk of falling;
    c. failing to warn the public of the dangerous condition when Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the condition; and
    d. otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

15. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the branch’s falling and of Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages described above.

16. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable to Defendant. A landowner whose tree or tree limbs overhang a public walkway and where the limb is visibly cracked, decayed, or rotten may reasonably anticipate the risk of falling and therefore must take reasonable measures to prevent harm.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Thomas Roberts as follows:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial for past and future medical expenses, past and future lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other non-economic damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence;

B. Economic damages of at least $3,100.00 (representing approximately $2,500.00 in medical expenses and $600.00 in lost wages), subject to proof at trial;

C. Costs of suit and reasonable interest as allowed by law;

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

LEGAL AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies on the general common-law duty of care applicable to landowners and other authorities that govern negligence and premises liability in Massachusetts, including the statute of limitations for actions sounding in tort. Relevant authorities include, without limitation:

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for tort actions);

- Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 285, 323, 360, 361 (reasonable care for dangerous conditions on property and liability for negligent maintenance that causes harm to others);

- Massachusetts caselaw recognizing the general duty of landowners to maintain property so as not to create dangerous conditions to persons lawfully on adjacent public ways and analyzing proximate cause, foreseeability and reasonableness in negligence cases. See, e.g., (representative authorities) Robichaud v. United States Gypsum Co., Conn. & Mass. negligence principles applied; Byrne v. City of Boston (premises liability principles); and other Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decisions discussing landowner duties, foreseeability, and proximate causation in negligence claims — see e.g., SJC decisions on negligence and premises liability addressing duty and foreseeability as elements of liability.

- Plaintiff also relies upon general tort principles enunciated in leading cases such as Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928); and pertinent Restatement authorities for the propositions of duty, breach, causation and foreseeable harm.

(Notes: Plaintiff intends to rely at trial and in briefing on Massachusetts statutes and controlling Massachusetts caselaw instructive on the duties of property owners and on issues of proximate cause and foreseeability. Plaintiff will supplement and particularize her authority citations as necessary in pleadings, motions, and trial filings in accordance with Mass. R. Civ. P. and local practice. Plaintiff has cited the foregoing representative authorities to establish the general legal framework of the negligence claim asserted here.)

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
