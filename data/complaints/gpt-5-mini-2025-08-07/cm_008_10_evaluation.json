It does not address standards for modification of custody or decision\u2011making authority based on a material change affecting a child\u2019s welfare, nor does it discuss educational stability as a best\u2011interest factor. Thus, while it is relevant to parental decisionmaking rights, it does not provide authority for the specific Massachusetts custody\u2011modification proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. \u2026 As we have explained, the Due Process Clause does not permit a State to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u2018better\u2019 decision could be made.\u201d (530 U.S. at 66\u201367, 72\u201373)."
