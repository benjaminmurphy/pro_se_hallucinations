  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff is a tenant at 45 Elm St., Defendant is the owner and landlord of the premises, and Plaintiff took possession and pays monthly rent ($2,200). These factual allegations adequately establish a landlord-tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant began or permitted renovation in the adjacent unit, permitted/allowed/undertook the work, and failed to abate or reasonably mitigate the disruption (offering only a nominal $100 reduction). Those allegations sufficiently plead acts and omissions by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges sustained, repeated drilling, hammering, sawing and loud worker activity during daytime hours for approximately two months, interference with Plaintiff\u2019s ability to work from home (impaired concentration and phone/video calls), and dust ingress. Those factual allegations support a claim of substantial, not trivial, interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the construction in the neighboring unit (which Defendant controls or permitted) produced the noise and dust that entered Plaintiff\u2019s unit and that those conditions directly and proximately resulted from Defendant\u2019s conduct. Those factual allegations adequately plead causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges specific harms\u2014loss of the full benefit of the leasehold, impairment of use for work, annoyance, discomfort, emotional distress\u2014and estimates monetary damages of $800, plus the insufficiency of the $100 rent reduction. These facts sufficiently plead compensable damages."
