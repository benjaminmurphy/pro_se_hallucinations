    "material_substantial_change": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a concrete, unanticipated change since the prior order: Defendant's relocation to New Hampshire (\u00b6 5.1) and his intent to keep the same schedule (\u00b6 5.2), resulting in ~90-minute one-way drives (\u00b6 5.3) that cause school-night travel, missed/late school and loss of after-school activities, and observable anxiety in Sophie (\u00b6\u00b6 5.4\u20135.5). These facts are pleaded as a substantial and material change affecting Sophie\u2019s welfare (\u00b6\u00b6 5.6)."
