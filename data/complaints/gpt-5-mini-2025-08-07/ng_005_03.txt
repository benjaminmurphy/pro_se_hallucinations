COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff"), by counsel pro se1, brings this Complaint against defendant Mark Dorsey ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual and resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Dorsey is an individual who resided in or near Springfield, Massachusetts at the time of the incident and is the owner of a ladder that fell causing damage to Plaintiff's vehicle.

3. The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of this Court for a civil tort action.

4. Venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court because the incident described herein occurred in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts (123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about March 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully using the shared driveway of a duplex located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

6. Plaintiff parked and/or was backing into the driveway where Defendant habitually stored a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against the wooden fence adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area.

7. On multiple prior occasions before March 15, 2023, Plaintiff warned Defendant that she was concerned the ladder might fall onto her vehicle, particularly on windy days. Plaintiff requested that Defendant secure, tie down, or move the ladder.

8. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concern and stated that he would tie it down or move it, but failed to take reasonable steps to secure or remove the ladder.

9. On or about March 15, 2023, during a windy condition at the driveway, a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder owned or controlled by Defendant to fall from the fence area onto Plaintiff’s automobile while Plaintiff was backing into the driveway.

10. The falling ladder struck the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle, denting the hood and cracking the windshield.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the ladder striking Plaintiff’s vehicle, Plaintiff suffered property damage consisting of damage to the hood and a cracked windshield which required repair and replacement.

12. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses, including an insurance deductible and rental car costs while her vehicle was in the shop for over one week, and seeks compensation for these losses. (Exact amounts will be proven at trial.)

13. Plaintiff has not suffered medical expenses or lost wages as a result of this incident.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, a person owes a duty to act with reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. This duty includes taking reasonable care to prevent physical harm or property damage that a reasonable person would foresee as likely to cause injury to others.

16. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage and securing of the ladder he owned or controlled so that it would not pose an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to persons or property lawfully using the adjacent driveway.

17. Defendant breached that duty by negligently leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder unsecured and leaning against the fence immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area despite actual notice (Plaintiff's repeated warnings) that it presented a risk of falling onto Plaintiff’s vehicle in windy conditions, and despite Defendant’s representations that he would secure or move the ladder.

18. Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of the ladder falling onto Plaintiff’s vehicle when a gust of wind occurred, and of the property damage and attendant out-of-pocket expenses sustained by Plaintiff.

19. As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff has suffered property damage and economic losses, including repair/replacement costs for the hood and windshield, an insurance deductible, rental car expenses, and such other damages to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant and grant the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial for property damage and out-of-pocket expenses (including repair and replacement costs, insurance deductible, rental vehicle costs), together with interest thereon from the date of loss;

B. Costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees to the extent permitted by law;

C. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

ATTORNEY/LEGAL-PRINCIPLES NOTE (for convenience)

- Plaintiff’s negligence claim will be governed by Massachusetts law and common-law negligence principles: duty, breach, causation (actual and proximate), and damages.

- The Massachusetts statute of limitations applicable to personal injury and property tort actions is three years from the date of injury under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for tort actions) (Plaintiff asserts this action is timely; incident date March 15, 2023).

- Plaintiff intends to rely on Massachusetts common-law negligence principles and authoritative tort law, including the Restatement (Second) of Torts concerning duty and negligent acts, foreseeability, and proximate cause.

IMPORTANT NOTE AND RECOMMENDATION

I have drafted this Complaint using the facts you provided. This is a pro se filing by a non-lawyer. I have not provided an exhaustive listing of Massachusetts cases or case citations in this document. Before filing, you should have this Complaint reviewed by a Massachusetts-licensed attorney or a legal aid attorney to (1) add precise statutory and case citations that your local judges and clerks expect, (2) include accurate and specific damage amounts and supporting documentation, (3) ensure proper service and filing procedures are followed in Hampden Superior Court, and (4) confirm that the complaint complies with all applicable rules of civil procedure and local court rules. If you would like, I can produce a revised complaint formatted to the Court’s rules without inventing or attributing case law beyond the statutes and general authorities referenced above.
