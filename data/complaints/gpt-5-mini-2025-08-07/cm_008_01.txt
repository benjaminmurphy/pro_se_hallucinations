v.                                   Docket No. ____________

Michael Smith
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY

1. Parties
   1.1 Plaintiff: Jennifer Lee, primary residential parent of the minor child Emily Smith (born 2015). Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2 Defendant: Michael Smith, non-residential parent of Emily Smith.

2. Court and Jurisdiction
   2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, and other applicable Massachusetts statutes and practice because the child’s primary residence and the subject custody order are within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.
   2.2 Venue is proper in this Court because the prior custody judgment that is the subject of this modification action was entered in this Court and the child resides in Bristol County.

3. Prior Order
   3.1 On May 15, 2022, this Court entered a judgment and order concerning the custody of the parties’ minor child, Emily Smith. That order provided that the parties share legal custody, that Plaintiff Jennifer Lee is the primary residential parent, and that Defendant Michael Smith has substantial weekend time including Sunday nights. The order further required the parties to cooperate on school matters and to keep one another informed regarding the child’s education and health.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   4.1 Since entry of the May 15, 2022 order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child that was not anticipated at the time of the prior order.
   4.2 Over the past year, Defendant Michael Smith has repeatedly and unilaterally kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, stating that Emily “needs a mental health day.” These Monday absences have occurred regularly (multiple times per month) and are not supported by any medical documentation, note from a licensed mental health provider, or other written excuse provided to Plaintiff or to the school.
   4.3 Defendant also regularly refuses to take Emily to tutoring sessions or academic support appointments that are scheduled during his weekend parenting time, causing missed academic supports.
   4.4 As a direct result of Defendant’s repeated decisions to keep Emily home from school on Mondays and his refusal to cooperate with academic supports, Emily has received truancy warnings from her school, and her grades and standardized test scores have declined substantially compared to the academic standing reported to the Court when the May 15, 2022 order was entered.
   4.5 Plaintiff has attempted to resolve these issues through communication with Defendant and through school conferences, but Defendant has not ceased the pattern of Monday absences, has not provided any medical documentation for those absences, and has continued to deprive Emily of tutoring and academic supports occurring during his time.
   4.6 The foregoing facts constitute a material change in circumstances that affects Emily’s health, education, and welfare and therefore warrants modification of the existing custody arrangements.

5. Legal Standard
   5.1 This Court may modify prior custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material change in circumstances impacting the child’s best interests and welfare and may fashion relief that serves the child’s best interests. The best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in any custody modification. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C; see also the established principles in Massachusetts family law recognizing that a material change in circumstances affecting a child’s welfare may justify modification of custody or decision-making authority.
   5.2 Plaintiff alleges and will prove that the pattern of school absences, missed academic supports, and declining educational performance constitute the required material change in circumstances and that a modification of decision-making authority and/or parenting time is necessary to protect Emily’s educational welfare and overall well-being.

6. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   6.1 That the May 15, 2022 custody order be modified to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority (tie-breaker or sole final authority) over school attendance, educational decisions, tutoring and academic interventions, and school-related matters until further order of the Court; or, in the alternative,
   6.2 That the Court modify the current parenting time schedule to eliminate or substantially restrict overnight parenting time that interferes with school nights, specifically by ending Defendant’s Sunday night overnight stays (or limiting in-person time on Sundays so that the child is home and ready for school Monday morning), such that school-night parenting is minimized and the child’s attendance and academic performance are protected;
   6.3 That the Court order that Defendant may not keep Emily home from school for any purported “mental health day” without a contemporaneous written statement from a licensed health or mental health professional, and that any such excused absence must be provided to Plaintiff and to the school in advance where practicable or within 24 hours;
   6.4 That the Court order that Defendant shall cooperate in scheduling and attending (where appropriate) tutoring, academic supports, and school meetings, and shall not unilaterally refuse to transport or permit Emily to attend court-ordered or mutually agreed academic interventions;
   6.5 That the Court order an immediate educational assessment or school liaison / educational specialist and/or a custody/parenting evaluation or guardian ad litem appointment (if the Court deems appropriate) to evaluate Emily’s educational needs and to make recommendations to the Court regarding parenting time and decision-making consistent with the child’s best interests;
   6.6 That the Court award any further temporary relief necessary to protect Emily’s attendance, education, and welfare pending final hearing on this complaint (including temporary injunctions or temporary modification of parenting time as the Court finds necessary);
   6.7 That the Court order such further relief as is necessary and just, including reasonable costs and any other relief this Court deems appropriate.

7. Basis in Law and Authorities (Representative)
   Plaintiff relies upon the statutory and case law governing custody modification, jurisdiction, best interests determinations, the duty of parents to cooperate in the child’s education, and the Court’s broad equitable powers to fashion appropriate relief to protect the welfare of children. Representative authorities include, without limitation:
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act) (jurisdictional framework);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutes governing domestic relations and custody matters);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A (duty to report suspected child abuse and neglect — reporting obligations where welfare is at risk);
   - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71 and related education statutes (statutes and regulations governing compulsory attendance, truancy, and school responsibilities);
   - Massachusetts General Court and Probate and Family Court authority permitting custody modification upon a showing of material change in circumstances and the best interest standard;
   - Relevant Massachusetts appellate decisions recognizing that a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare justifies modification of custody or decision-making authority and permitting courts to alter parenting time when necessary to protect a child’s education, health, or welfare (authorities addressing parental interference with education and need for court intervention).
   Plaintiff will rely on applicable Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court precedent and statutory authority at hearing to establish the legal basis for modification.

8. Verification
   8.1 I, Jennifer Lee, declare under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

Request for Hearing and Proposed Orders
Plaintiff respectfully requests a prompt hearing on this Complaint and, in the meantime, requests temporary relief as set forth in Paragraphs 6.3–6.5 above pending a full evidentiary hearing.

Notes and Practical Guidance (for filing; informational only)
- Please present this signed Complaint to the Bristol County Probate and Family Court Clerk’s Office for filing, submit the filing fee or request a waiver if eligible, and arrange for service of the Complaint and any temporary orders on Defendant in accordance with the Probate and Family Court rules.
- If the Court requires a specific case citation list or statutory references in full, Plaintiff may present the Court with supplemental memoranda identifying the precise statutory sections and leading SJC and Appeals Court authorities on material change in circumstances and best-interests analysis. Plaintiff intends to rely on the statutory framework for custody jurisdiction and modification (including the UCCJEA) and on Massachusetts case law holding that interference with a child’s education and a decline in academic performance may constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification.
- Because this filing will affect the child’s legal and practical life, Plaintiff is strongly encouraged, if at all possible, to seek assistance from an attorney or a legal aid clinic to review and finalize pleadings, to ensure compliance with local court rules, and to represent the child’s interests at any hearing.
