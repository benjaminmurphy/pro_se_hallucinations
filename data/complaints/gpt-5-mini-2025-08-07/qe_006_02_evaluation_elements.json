  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff resides at the premises, entered into a tenancy effective May 1, 2022, and pays monthly rent of $1,200 (\u00b61, \u00b63) and identifies Defendant as the landlord/owner/manager (\u00b62), which sufficiently pleads a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the Defendant is the landlord and owner (\u00b62) and describes his acts/omissions: the hot water ceased, Plaintiff notified Defendant, Defendant ordered a part but failed to restore hot water over a multi\u2011week period despite updates (\u00b65\u20137, \u00b610, \u00b618), which pleads a landlord act/omission."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a prolonged (\u2248three\u2011week) lack of hot water that prevented Plaintiff from taking hot showers, bathing her infant, and made washing dishes difficult; it alleges reliance on gyms and trips to the mother\u2019s home and labels the condition a substantial/unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment (\u00b65, \u00b68\u20139, \u00b617). These facts adequately allege substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges a temporal and causal chain: hot water ceased on/around Nov. 10; Plaintiff notified Defendant immediately; Defendant failed to timely repair or provide alternatives, and as a result Plaintiff lacked hot water and incurred harms (\u00b65\u20138, \u00b610, \u00b617\u201319), which sufficiently pleads causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete damages: out\u2011of\u2011pocket expenses (gym fees, transportation, childcare arrangements), estimates damages of $450, and seeks rent abatement and other relief (\u00b68, \u00b611, \u00b620, Prayer A\u2013B), which adequately pleads damages."
