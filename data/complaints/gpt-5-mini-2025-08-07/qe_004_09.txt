COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Only claim: Breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apt. __, Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts 01605. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Michael Smith is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (the “Premises”), and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 The parties entered into a written or oral tenancy for the Premises, with the tenancy commencing on January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant.
1.4 The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of Worcester District Court. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the Premises are located in Worcester County and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Worcester County.

2. Statement of Claim
2.1 Plaintiff brings this single claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the amount of $280, costs, and any other relief the Court deems proper.

3. Facts — General Allegations
3.1 Plaintiff is a lawful residential tenant of the Premises since January 15, 2022, and has timely paid rent throughout the tenancy.
3.2 Beginning approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint (approximately September 2025), Plaintiff began regularly discovering mouse droppings in the kitchen area of the Premises.
3.3 Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the presence of mice and of the unsanitary and disruptive conditions caused by rodent infestation and the presence of rodent droppings.
3.4 In response, Defendant placed a few mouse traps in the kitchen and, on one occasion, hired an exterminator for a single visit.
3.5 The exterminator hired by Defendant advised that the building in which the Premises is located appears to require more comprehensive and repeated pest-control measures to abate an ongoing rodent infestation.
3.6 Defendant declined to authorize more comprehensive or repeated extermination treatment, stating that mice are “normal for older buildings” and suggesting that Plaintiff needs to keep the kitchen cleaner, notwithstanding Plaintiff’s reasonable and diligent housekeeping efforts.
3.7 Plaintiff has continued to find mouse droppings on a weekly basis despite Defendant’s limited actions.
3.8 As a direct result of the ongoing rodent problem and Defendant’s failure to take adequate remedial action, Plaintiff has been forced to discard approximately $200 worth of foodstuffs that were not stored in sealed containers and has incurred approximately $80 in out-of-pocket expense purchasing plastic containers and other storage to protect food, for total out-of-pocket damages of approximately $280.
3.9 Plaintiff has also experienced emotional distress, anxiety, and a loss of the peaceful use and enjoyment of the Premises, including the kitchen, affecting her ability to prepare and consume food in her home.
3.10 Defendant’s failure to take reasonable, adequate and timely measures to abate the rodent infestation and to remedy the resulting unsanitary conditions has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

4. Legal Basis for Claim — Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
4.1 Under Massachusetts law and well-established landlord-tenant principles, a landlord owes tenants the covenant of quiet enjoyment and is obligated to provide premises that are fit for habitation and free from conditions that materially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the rental unit. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing an implied warranty of habitability and the use of housing-code standards to determine violations); accord cases and authorities cited below.
4.2 The covenant of quiet enjoyment encompasses an implied obligation by a landlord to take reasonable steps to abate serious infestations and other conditions that render rental premises unsafe, unsanitary, or unfit for ordinary residential uses, or that materially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., Javins, 428 F.2d at 1074–76; Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); Park West Management v. Mitchell, 47 Cal.App.3d 14 (1975) (recognizing landlord obligations in the face of serious housing defects).
4.3 Massachusetts law recognizes that sanitary and health-related standards promulgated pursuant to the Massachusetts General Laws and the State Sanitary Code are relevant to determining whether a landlord has breached obligations to provide habitable premises and to secure quiet enjoyment. See M.G.L. c. 111; 105 C.M.R. (CMR) 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
4.4 Local boards of health and the State Sanitary Code proscribe conditions of rodent infestation, the presence of excreta, and other unsanitary conditions that materially affect habitability and habitational use. See M.G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L (authorizing public health regulation and enforcement); 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (housing standards addressing infestation and sanitation).
4.5 A landlord’s failure to abate ongoing infestation or to provide adequate pest control after notice to the landlord constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may justify damages for the tenant’s loss of use, costs incurred, and other consequential harms. See Javins, supra; Hilder, supra; see also cases recognizing landlord responsibility for maintaining premises free from vermin and hazards and for effecting repairs necessary to preserve habitability and quiet enjoyment.
4.6 Plaintiff provided prompt notice to Defendant of the infestation and unsanitary conditions and requested adequate remediation. Defendant’s response—placement of a few traps and a single exterminator visit while refusing comprehensive treatment—was unreasonable and inadequate to abate an ongoing infestation in a multi-unit, older building as advised by the exterminator and consistent with the standards of habitability and the State Sanitary Code.
4.7 Defendant’s conduct constitutes a substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises: Plaintiff has been unable to safely store food, prepare meals without anxiety, or use her kitchen in a reasonable way because of recurring rodent droppings and the risk of contamination.
4.8 Plaintiff’s damages are directly attributable to Defendant’s breach: out-of-pocket losses for spoiled food ($200) and containers ($80), and non-economic harms in the form of anxiety and diminished use and enjoyment. Plaintiff seeks recovery of actual damages in the amount of $280, plus costs and such further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.

5. Request for Relief / Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson demands judgment against Defendant Michael Smith as follows:
A. For compensatory damages in the amount of $280;
B. For costs and disbursements of this action, including filing fees;
C. For pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable under the circumstances.

6. Demand for Jury Trial
Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
