COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Complaint; Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Tyler, and for his Complaint against Defendant Sophia Martinez alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff: Jordan Tyler is an adult resident of Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at psm1433@gmail.com and (617) 555-0123.

2. Defendant: Sophia Martinez is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the “Premises”), and at all relevant times was the landlord/lessor for the Premises.

3. Jurisdiction and venue: This action is brought in the Boston Housing Court, which has jurisdiction over landlord-tenant and housing habitability disputes affecting residential premises in the City of Boston pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, §26 and the Housing Court’s statutory jurisdiction over actions arising out of landlord-tenant relationships. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises and the parties are located in Roxbury, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for the Premises on or about March 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00.

5. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late on rent payment due to medical bills. Plaintiff promptly paid the full rent and a customary late fee, and does not dispute that rent and late fee were paid in full.

6. In November 2025, Plaintiff discovered water seeping into the basement unit through an exterior basement wall during periods of heavy rain. The water infiltration was recurrent and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water intrusion by text message and requested that Defendant investigate and repair the condition. Defendant replied that she would “look into it,” but took no effective remedial action.

8. Several weeks after Plaintiff’s notice to Defendant and after no meaningful repairs had been made, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston / local board of health to report the water intrusion and other code-related defects at the Premises.

9. Inspectors from the City/local board of health inspected the Premises and documented the water infiltration and additional code violations, and advised that the conditions were in need of correction to comply with the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000, et seq.) and local housing codes.

10. The water infiltration damaged Plaintiff’s personal property—a rug and a bookshelf against the affected wall—causing combined property loss of approximately $400.00. In addition, Plaintiff has continuously run a dehumidifier to control dampness in the basement unit, increasing electrical usage and expenses.

11. Defendant has failed and refused to effect necessary repairs to cure the ongoing water intrusion and related habitability defects at the Premises despite actual knowledge of the problem and after receipt of notice and a municipal inspection identifying the condition.

12. After the municipal inspection and in the weeks that followed, Defendant told Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026. Defendant stated she considered Plaintiff a “problem tenant” and attributed her decision not to renew the lease to Plaintiff’s late rent in October 2025. The timing of the threatened non-renewal was closely after the municipal inspection and Plaintiff’s report of habitability defects.

13. Defendant’s threatened non-renewal and representations that Plaintiff is a “problem tenant” are retaliatory and were communicated in the wake of Plaintiff’s exercise of his rights to report a health and safety problem to municipal authorities. Defendant’s conduct has further interfered with Plaintiff’s peaceful, quiet, and lawful use and enjoyment of the Premises.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach (as alleged below), Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the amount of at least $800.00 (including property damage, increased electricity, and related expenses), and continues to suffer ongoing inconvenience, loss of use, emotional distress, and diminution of the habitability and value of the tenancy.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 above as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all times material hereto, Plaintiff was in lawful possession of the Premises as a tenant and owed rent to Defendant under the terms of the tenancy.

17. Under Massachusetts common law, every lease or tenancy for a dwelling contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. That covenant requires that the tenant be afforded the possession and beneficial use of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or by those acting for the landlord. A landlord breaches the covenant when the landlord substantially interferes with, deprives, or destroys the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises by failing to remedy hazardous or habitability defects of which the landlord has knowledge or reasonably should have had knowledge, or by engaging in retaliatory conduct that substantially interferes with the tenancy.

18. Defendant has materially and substantially breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by (a) failing to timely repair and remedy the recurring water infiltration and related habitability defects in the basement unit despite actual notice; (b) allowing conditions to persist that caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property and required continuous operation of a dehumidifier; and (c) threatening non-renewal of the tenancy in circumstances that are retaliatory and in response to Plaintiff’s lawful reporting of municipal code violations and requests for repair.

19. Plaintiff provided actual notice to Defendant of the water infiltration and gave Defendant a reasonable opportunity to remedy the condition, but Defendant failed to take timely remedial action. Plaintiff also exercised rights to report health and safety defects to municipal authorities; thereafter Defendant’s threatened non-renewal was an intentional act that interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and was a retaliatory response.

20. The continuing water intrusion and Defendant’s failure to repair have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal belongings, increased Plaintiff’s electrical expenses, and caused emotional distress and diminution in the value and habitability of the tenancy.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, but as of the date of filing Plaintiff reasonably estimates damages of at least $800.00, together with treble damages, costs, interest, attorneys’ fees (as allowed by law), and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (Representative)

Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts statutory and regulatory authorities governing landlord obligations and habitability, as well as Massachusetts common law concerning the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general statutory framework governing landlord-tenant relationships);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process) (statutory scheme relating to possessory actions);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health), including authority of local boards of health to inspect and enforce sanitary conditions;
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, §26 (Housing Court jurisdiction);
- Recognized Massachusetts common-law principles recognizing the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and a landlord’s duty to refrain from substantial interference with a tenant’s possession and use of leased premises;
- Relevant Massachusetts cases and precedent addressing landlord duties, the covenant of quiet enjoyment, retaliatory non-renewal/retaliation, and remedies for breaches of habitability obligations (authorities to be cited and relied upon at trial and in support of motions).

(Additional specific statutory and case authorities will be set forth in briefing and at trial as necessary; Plaintiff reserves the right to add specific controlling authorities as discovery proceeds.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $800.00 as currently estimated;

B. For a declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law;

C. For injunctive and/or equitable relief directing Defendant to repair and remediate the water infiltration and related habitability defects at the Premises (or, in the alternative, for an award of damages and abatement in lieu of specific performance), including compliance with the State Sanitary Code and any municipal orders;

D. For costs of suit, reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law, pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, and court costs;

E. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
