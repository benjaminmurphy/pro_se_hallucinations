COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
   - Petitioner: Laura Matthews, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555-0123. Email: psm1443@gmail.com.
   - Respondent: Daniel Parker, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   - This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Act and related statutes governing child custody and modification of custody orders because the parties and the children reside in Bristol County and a prior custody order of this Court governs the parties’ parenting time.
   - Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court pursuant to the applicable jurisdictional statutes and rules.

3. Children
   - The minor children who are the subject of this action are:
     a. Emily Parker, born 2017 (age 8);
     b. Jacob Parker, born 2019 (age 6).

4. Existing Order
   - On or about May 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order (the “Existing Order”) awarding shared custody with the Petitioner having primary custody, and awarding the Respondent overnight parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week (the “Overnight Schedule”).

5. Nature of Action
   - This is a Complaint to modify the Existing Order on the ground that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order which affects the best interests of the children and warrants modification of the overnight parenting schedule.

6. Facts Supporting Modification (Material Change in Circumstances)
   a. At the time the Existing Order was entered on May 15, 2021, both parties worked regular daytime schedules and the overnight parenting schedule was feasible and consistent with the children’s needs.
   b. Since entry of the Existing Order, the Respondent has accepted a new job that requires him to work overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM several nights per week (the “Night Shifts”), including many of the nights on which he is scheduled to have overnight visits under the Existing Order.
   c. The Respondent’s work schedule regularly conflicts with his overnight parenting time. He frequently arrives home from his shift exhausted and unable to supervise or meaningfully parent the children during the overnight periods.
   d. On numerous occasions, the Respondent has left the children at the Petitioner’s home with little or no advance notice on the day of the scheduled visit because he claims he is too tired to watch them after his shift.
   e. The Respondent has on multiple occasions left the children in the care of his roommate during his scheduled overnights rather than personally supervising them. The Petitioner has limited familiarity and contact with the roommate and has concerns about the adequacy of supervision and the children’s safety and welfare when in the roommate’s care.
   f. The children have reported to the Petitioner that the Respondent frequently falls asleep on the couch after returning from his night shift, and that he is often not awake or alert to attend to their needs during the night.
   g. These changes in the Respondent’s availability and the manner in which overnight care is being provided were not anticipated at the time of the Existing Order and constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances that impacts the children’s stability, safety, and well‑being.

7. Best Interests of the Children
   - The requested modification is in the children’s best interests. The children require appropriate supervision during overnight periods, uninterrupted sleep cycles, consistent routines, and a safe environment. The Respondent’s current work schedule and its effect on his overnight parenting time interfere with these needs and the children’s welfare. The Petitioner seeks a modification that preserves meaningful parenting time for the Respondent when he is actually available and capable of providing appropriate care, while protecting the children’s stability and safety.

8. Relief Requested
   The Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order as follows:
   a. Find and declare that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order such that modification of the custody/parenting time plan is warranted.
   b. Modify the Existing Order with respect to overnight parenting time so that:
      i. Overnight parenting time with the Respondent shall occur only on nights when the Respondent is not scheduled to work a night shift (i.e., when he is actually off work and available to personally supervise and care for the children);
      ii. Where the Respondent’s overnight work schedule conflicts with scheduled overnight parenting time, the overnight shall be converted to an equivalent period of daytime parenting time (for example, an extended daytime visit or an additional period of custodial time during the Respondent’s next available non-working period), changing the schedule in a manner that preserves the Respondent’s substantial parenting time overall but only when he is available to provide appropriate overnight care;
      iii. The Respondent shall provide reasonable advance notice to the Petitioner of any changes in his work schedule known to him at least 72 hours in advance when such changes affect scheduled parenting time, and, except in emergency circumstances, shall not leave the children in the care of third parties (including roommates) during his scheduled overnights without the prior consent of the Petitioner and disclosure of the third party’s identity and contact information;
      iv. The Court set a schedule for temporary relief and/or a hearing schedule, including expedited mediation or custody evaluation if the Court deems it appropriate, and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the children.
   c. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems appropriate in the circumstances, including, if necessary, attorney’s fees and costs.

9. Basis Under Law
   - The Petitioner seeks modification consistent with the statutory and case law standards applicable to custody and parenting time modifications in Massachusetts, namely that a court may modify an existing custody or parenting order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the existing order and a demonstrated need for modification in the best interests of the child(ren). The Petitioner requests that the Court apply these standards in deciding this Complaint.

10. Request for Hearing
   - The Petitioner requests a hearing on this Complaint and further requests that the Court order any temporary provisions necessary to protect the children pending hearing (including temporary modification of overnight parenting time consistent with paragraphs 8.b.i–iii above) and to provide for the prompt resolution of this matter.

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
   a. Accept jurisdiction over this matter and set this Complaint for hearing;
   b. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order;
   c. Enter an order modifying the overnight parenting time provisions of the Existing Order so that overnights occur only when the Respondent is actually off work and available to personally supervise the children, and implement the alternative and notice provisions described above;
   d. Grant such temporary relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate pending hearing;
   e. Award such other and further relief as justice requires.

DATED: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

Selected Massachusetts Caselaw (examples of leading principles regarding modification and best interests)
- In re Marriage of: Decisions interpreting modification standard and best interests of the child (Mass. SJC and Mass. Appeals Ct. decisions recognizing that modification requires a material and substantial change in circumstances and that child’s best interests govern).

- Cases addressing parental availability, supervision, and stability as factors in custody and parenting time determinations.
- Leading SJC and Appeals Court decisions interpreting “material and substantial change” and “best interests” standards in custody modification proceedings.

(Notes: The Petitioner intends to rely on the statutes and controlling Massachusetts caselaw addressing modification of custody and parenting time, the “material and substantial change” standard, and the “best interests of the child” analysis in support of the requested relief. Counsel and the Court may cite and supplement the above with specific binding authorities and precise statutory subsections at hearing.)
