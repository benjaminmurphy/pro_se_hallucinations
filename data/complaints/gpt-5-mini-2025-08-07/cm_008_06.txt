PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

v.
Mark Johnson
Respondent

Docket No. _______________________

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties

1.1 Petitioner. Jessica Taylor ("Petitioner"), pro se, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Respondent. Mark Johnson ("Respondent"), the other parent of the minor child referenced below, resides in Massachusetts (last known address and contact information in Respondent’s possession and in the existing court file).

2. Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1 Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §28 (custody and modification of custody orders), and the rules governing the Probate and Family Court. The Court that entered the original custody order (the Bristol County Probate and Family Court) retains continuing jurisdiction to modify custody and parenting-time orders affecting the parties’ minor child.

3. Existing Order

3.1 A judgment and order concerning custody and visitation of the parties’ child, Emily Johnson (age 10), was entered in this Court on June 15, 2020 (the "Existing Order" or "Order"). The Existing Order provides for joint legal custody, designates Petitioner as the primary residential parent, and provides Respondent with substantial weekend residential time that includes overnight stays on Sunday nights. The Existing Order further requires the parties to cooperate on school matters and to keep one another informed.

4. The Child

4.1 Emily Johnson (born in approximately 2015) is the parties’ minor child and the subject of this Complaint. Emily is currently ten (10) years old.

5. Nature of the Action and Relief Sought

5.1 Petitioner brings this Complaint to modify the Existing Order because there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that affects the welfare, education, and best interests of the child. Petitioner seeks modification under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §28, to (a) grant Petitioner final decision-making authority regarding Emily’s school attendance and educational matters (or, in the alternative, to award Petitioner exclusive decision-making authority over day-to-day school attendance and tutoring decisions), and (b) eliminate or limit Respondent’s Sunday overnight parenting time during the school year (or otherwise reduce school-night overnights that interfere with Emily’s consistent school attendance), together with any other relief this Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect Emily’s educational stability and best interests.

6. Factual Allegations — Material Change in Circumstances

6.1 At the time the Existing Order was entered (June 15, 2020), Emily was attending school regularly, her grades and test scores were satisfactory, and there were no school attendance concerns.

6.2 Over the past year, Respondent has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays immediately following his weekend parenting time, stating that Emily "needs a mental health day." These Monday absences are frequent, recurring, and do not correspond to any written medical excuse or health provider note produced by Respondent.

6.3 Respondent has refused repeated, reasonable requests from Petitioner to provide written medical documentation or other appropriate verification justifying the Monday absences. Respondent has not obtained or produced any school excusal notes signed by a physician, licensed mental health practitioner, or the school nurse to justify the absences.

6.4 As a direct result of the unexplained and frequent Monday absences and Respondent’s refusal to insure attendance at scheduled educational supports, Emily has received truancy warnings from her school and her grades and standardized test scores have declined over the past school year.

6.5 In addition to the Monday absences, Respondent regularly refuses to take Emily to tutoring or other educational appointments that fall during his weekend parenting time, causing Emily to miss previously-scheduled tutoring sessions that Petitioner and Emily’s school reasonably believe are necessary to address learning needs and to restore academic performance.

6.6 Petitioner has attempted in good faith to resolve the attendance and tutoring disputes with Respondent without court intervention, including requests to cooperate on school matters as required by the Existing Order, but Respondent has not cooperated and continues the pattern of absences and refusal to support tutoring.

6.7 Petitioner reasonably believes that Respondent’s conduct — the recurring unexplained Monday absences, refusal to support tutoring, and the resulting decline in Emily’s academic performance — constitutes a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order that adversely affects Emily’s welfare and educational stability and therefore warrants modification of the Existing Order in the child’s best interests.

7. Legal Basis for Relief

7.1 Modification Standard. Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting-time orders remain subject to modification when a party demonstrates a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and best interests. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §28; see also cases interpreting the standard for modification and the "best interests of the child" analysis in custody modification proceedings. The Court must consider the best interests of the child, including stability in schooling and the child’s educational needs, when deciding whether to modify custody or parental decision-making authority.

7.2 Educational Stability and Attendance. Massachusetts law recognizes the importance of school attendance, the state’s compulsory attendance laws, and a child’s right to an education. The Court may order modifications to custody or parenting-time to ensure that the child's educational needs and school attendance are protected.

7.3 Authority to Grant Education-Related Decision Making. Courts in Massachusetts have authority to allocate parental decision-making authority over educational matters and may award final decision-making authority on school attendance where necessary to protect the child’s welfare and best interests.

7.4 Contempt and Enforcement. Where a custodial or parenting-time order requires cooperation on educational matters, the Court may enforce such obligations and consider remedies, including modification, where one parent’s conduct undermines the child’s schooling and the other parent's ability to carry out educational decisions.

(Representative statutory and case authority regarding modification, best-interest analysis, school attendance, and the court’s power to allocate educational decision-making and modify parenting time includes, but is not limited to: Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §28; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76, §1 (compulsory attendance and educational obligations); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §51A (reporting obligations concerning child welfare); and applicable Massachusetts cases interpreting those statutes and the standard for modification and best interests of the child. See, e.g., decisions and authorities addressing modification upon a material change of circumstances and the Court’s authority to allocate decision-making responsibility in the child’s best interest.)

[Note to clerk and parties: specific controlling precedents and supporting authorities will be cited at hearing and in any accompanying memorandum of law filed with the Court. Petitioner cites the statutory basis above and requests the Court to consider applicable Massachusetts case law on modification and best-interests analysis in rendering its decision.]

8. Requested Relief

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

8.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order (entered June 15, 2020) that adversely affects the welfare of the parties’ minor child, Emily Johnson;

8.2 Modify the Existing Order to grant Petitioner final decision-making authority over Emily’s school attendance and all routine educational decisions (including tutoring and educational supports). In the alternative, award Petitioner exclusive decision-making authority over Emily’s school attendance, tutoring, and day-to-day educational matters;

8.3 Alternatively or additionally, modify the parenting-time schedule to eliminate Respondent’s Sunday overnight parenting time during the school year (or otherwise reduce or shift school-night overnights so that Emily is at home for all school nights and does not miss school on Mondays as a result of Respondent’s parenting time), and enter a parenting-time plan that protects Emily’s consistent school attendance and educational stability;

8.4 Order any further remedies the Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect Emily’s educational stability, including, if appropriate, ordering Respondent to provide written medical or mental-health documentation for absences he claims to be for health reasons, and ordering make-up tutoring and counseling as necessary to address Emily’s educational decline;

8.5 Award such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper, including attorneys’ fees and costs to Petitioner if warranted by the circumstances and statutory authority; and

8.6 Award any other and further relief that the Court deems just and equitable.

9. Certification and Notice

9.1 Petitioner certifies that she will provide a copy of this Complaint to Respondent in accordance with the Rules of the Probate and Family Court and will file proof of service with the Court.

9.2 Petitioner requests that the Court schedule a hearing on an expedited basis if appropriate in light of the imminent and continuing impact of Respondent’s actions on Emily’s school attendance and academic progress.
