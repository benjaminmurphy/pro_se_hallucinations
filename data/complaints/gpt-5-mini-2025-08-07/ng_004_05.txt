COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Martinez ("Plaintiff"), pro se, and for her Complaint against Defendant Sarah Thompson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Martinez is an individual and resident who at all times relevant to this Complaint performed work as a grocery delivery worker and resides in Massachusetts. Plaintiff can be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Sarah Thompson is the owner of the three-unit apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the "Premises"). Defendant is sued in her individual capacity.

3. The events giving rise to this action occurred on February 15, 2023 on the sidewalk abutting the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Worcester District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester County, the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court, and Defendant is subject to the court's jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

6. Defendant owns and controls the three-unit apartment building at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA, and was responsible for maintaining the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Premises, including keeping it in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and invitees.

7. In February 2023, an extended winter storm deposited snow in Worcester. Defendant undertook some post-storm cleanup but left the sidewalk in an unsafe condition. Specifically, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply any de-icing material such as salt or sand.

8. Over the next two days, daytime thawing and nighttime freezing caused the un-salted narrow path on the sidewalk to become an ice sheet, creating a hazardous, slippery condition.

9. Tenants of the building recognized the dangerous condition. On or about February 15, 2023, tenants texted Defendant to report the icy condition and sent her photographs. In response, Defendant told tenants that "the sun will take care of it" and took no further action to render the sidewalk reasonably safe.

10. On February 15, 2023, while lawfully on the sidewalk delivering groceries to a tenant, Plaintiff walked in the cleared path as she normally would. Due to the icy sheet created by melting and refreezing in the un-salted narrow path, Plaintiff's feet slipped out from under her, and she fell backward, landing heavily on her lower back.

11. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a lower back injury requiring medical treatment. Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,500 in medical expenses related to treatment for her back injury.

12. As a further direct result of the injury, Plaintiff missed approximately one week of work and lost roughly $800 in wages.

13. Plaintiff has experienced pain, suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a proximate result of Defendant's conduct. Plaintiff reserves the right to prove additional medical expenses, lost earnings, and non-economic damages at trial.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

15. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully on the sidewalk (including delivery persons and other invitees/licensees) to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (landowner's duty to invitees); see also Massachusetts premises-liability principles described by Massachusetts courts.

16. Defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises after the snowstorm. Defendant's negligent acts and omissions include, but are not limited to:
    a. failing to remove ice and snow from the sidewalk in a timely and proper manner;
    b. failing to apply salt, sand, or other de-icing material to eliminate or materially reduce the hazardous icy condition created by melting and refreezing;
    c. failing to warn invitees and licensees, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous ice condition on the sidewalk;
    d. failing to take reasonable measures to inspect, discover, and correct the dangerous condition after tenants alerted Defendant to the hazard and provided photographs.

17. Defendant had actual notice of the hazardous condition and a reasonable opportunity to correct it. Tenants informed Defendant of the hazard and provided pictures, and Defendant expressly declined to take remedial action, stating that "the sun will take care of it."

18. The hazardous icy condition posed a foreseeable risk of harm to persons lawfully on the sidewalk, including delivery workers such as Plaintiff. Defendant's failure to remedy or warn about the ice was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's fall and injuries.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury to her lower back, incurred approximately $3,500 in medical bills, lost approximately $800 in earnings, endured pain and suffering, mental anguish, and other damages to be proven at trial.

20. Plaintiff has satisfied any applicable notice requirements and compliance with statutory conditions precedent, or such requirements are inapplicable.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, as follows:

A. Compensatory damages for medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (currently approximately $3,500);

B. Compensatory damages for lost wages in an amount to be proven at trial (currently approximately $800);

C. Compensatory damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial;

D. Costs, interest, and disbursements as allowed by law;

E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
