COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction

1.1 Petitioner: Laura Jenkins, residing at an address within Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Respondent: Michael Jenkins, the other parent of the minor children identified below, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

1.3 Minor Children: Sophie Jenkins (born 2017) and Ethan Jenkins (born 2019) (collectively “the children”).

1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law, including M.G.L. c. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act), and the General Laws and Rules governing the Probate and Family Court. The Court entered the existing custody/parenting schedule on May 15, 2020 (the “Existing Order”), and this Court retains authority to modify that order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the children’s best interests.

2. Relief Sought

2.1 Petitioner seeks modification of the Existing Order to change the Respondent’s weekly overnight parenting time so that overnights are scheduled only when Respondent is actually off work and able to provide safe, attentive care for the children. Petitioner also seeks any temporary relief the Court deems appropriate pending a final hearing (including temporary modification of Respondent’s overnight time on nights when Respondent works a night shift), an order directing a parenting evaluation or guardian ad litem if the Court deems one appropriate, and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

3. Background Facts

3.1 On May 15, 2020, this Court entered the Existing Order providing that the children primarily reside with Petitioner and that Respondent has parenting time every other weekend and one overnight per week.

3.2 At the time the Existing Order was entered, both parties worked primarily daytime schedules and the weekly overnight arrangement was reasonably calculated to further the children’s best interests and to promote meaningful contact with Respondent.

3.3 Since entry of the Existing Order, Respondent has changed employment. Respondent now works a night-shift schedule, regularly working from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on several nights each week. Respondent’s night shifts frequently coincide with his scheduled weekly overnights.

3.4 As a result of Respondent’s night work schedule, Respondent has on numerous occasions dropped the children off at Petitioner’s residence with little or no notice, stating that he is too fatigued from his shift to provide care after returning home. On other occasions, Respondent has left the children in the care of his roommate, with whom Petitioner has limited familiarity and no meaningful assurance of appropriate adult supervision. The children have told Petitioner that they sometimes fall asleep on the living room couch while Respondent naps after his shift. Petitioner has observed signs of fatigue and disrupted routines in the children after such nights.

3.5 Petitioner has attempted informally to address scheduling conflicts with Respondent and to arrange for overnights to occur when Respondent is available to provide attentive care, but Respondent has not agreed to a reliable, consistent adjustment to the overnight schedule. The frequent unexpected drop-offs and caregiving gaps have caused disruption to the children’s sleep and routines and raised concerns about the children’s safety, stability, and overall well-being.

4. Legal Basis for Modification

4.1 Standard: Under Massachusetts law, modification of a custody or parenting time order is appropriate where there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order and modification is necessary to serve the child’s best interests. Petitioner alleges that the facts described above constitute a material change in circumstances that has substantially affected the children’s welfare and that modification of the Existing Order is necessary to protect and promote the children’s best interests.

4.2 Facts Constituting a Material Change: Respondent’s regular night-shift employment, which routinely conflicts with his court-ordered weekly overnights, the resulting unscheduled drop-offs, the children’s reported and observed fatigue and disruption, and Respondent’s practice of leaving the children with his roommate (a person about whom Petitioner has limited knowledge) are material changes in circumstances that meaningfully affect the children’s safety, care, and stability.

4.3 Requested Modification is in the Children’s Best Interests: The requested modification — limiting Respondent’s overnight parenting time to times when Respondent is actually off work and demonstrably able to provide appropriate in-person care — is narrowly tailored, seeks to maintain meaningful contact with Respondent, and is designed to preserve the children’s routines, sleep health, and stability while safeguarding their safety and well-being.

5. Specific Relief Requested

Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order as follows:

5.1 Modify the Existing Order to provide that Respondent’s weekly overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when Respondent is not scheduled to work a night shift (i.e., is off work and reasonably available to provide direct care for the children). Where Respondent is scheduled to work overnight, Respondent’s overnight time for that week shall instead convert to an equivalent period of daytime parenting time or other makeup time agreed by the parties or ordered by the Court.

5.2 Temporarily modify Respondent’s current weekly overnight parenting time, pending final hearing, so that overnights do not occur on nights when Respondent is scheduled to work from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. or other hours that would materially interfere with his ability to provide awake, attentive care; and set an expedited hearing on the merits.

5.3 Order that any change in Respondent’s work schedule that will affect parenting time must be provided to Petitioner in writing (email or text acceptable) with at least 48 hours’ advance notice, except in emergencies.

5.4 Order that Respondent shall not leave the children in the care of any third party during his scheduled parenting time unless he provides Petitioner with the adult caregiver’s full name, address, and contact information in advance and Petitioner does not reasonably object within 24 hours (or such other procedure as the Court deems appropriate to protect the children’s safety).

5.5 Order that the parties attend mediation or parenting coordination to attempt to reach a permanent parenting-time plan consistent with the children’s best interests, and/or order a custody evaluation or guardian ad litem if the Court deems one appropriate.

5.6 Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

6. Supporting Evidence; Exhibits

6.1 Petitioner will present the Existing Order (entered May 15, 2020), witness testimony (including Petitioner and, if required, the children through appropriate testimony), and any documentary evidence necessary to prove the material change in circumstances and the requested relief.

6.2 Petitioner will offer evidence of Respondent’s changed work schedule, the dates and circumstances of unscheduled drop-offs, the children’s statements and observable reactions, and any other records or testimony relevant to the children’s well-being.

7. Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:

a. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order (May 15, 2020) and that modification is warranted to serve the children’s best interests;

b. Modify the Existing Order consistent with the relief requested in paragraph 5, above, including limiting Respondent’s overnights to times when he is actually off work and available to provide direct care;

c. Grant any temporary relief deemed necessary pending a final hearing;

d. Order mediation, parenting coordination, or a custody evaluation/guardian ad litem as the Court deems appropriate; and

e. Grant such other and further relief as justice requires.

8. Authorities (Representative)

Petitioner relies on the statutes and case law governing custody modifications and the best interests of the child standard in Massachusetts, including, without limitation:

Statutes and Rules:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (laws pertaining to children and families, including protections and welfare of children)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (Probate and Family Court jurisdiction over domestic relations matters)
- Mass. Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure and any local rules of the Probate and Family Court, Middlesex County

Representative Massachusetts Case Law (material-change / best-interests principles):
- Cases and precedent establishing that a modification requires proof of a material change in circumstances and that the best interests of the child control the Court’s exercise of discretion. See, generally, decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court interpreting modification standards and the best-interests analysis. (Petitioner will cite and rely upon controlling Massachusetts authority at hearing, including applicable SJC and Appeals Court decisions interpreting material change and best-interest standards under Massachusetts law.)

(Please note: Petitioner intends to rely at hearing on the applicable statutes, rules, and Massachusetts case law governing custody modification — including controlling SJC and Appeals Court precedents addressing the “material change in circumstances” standard and the best-interests-of-the-child standard — and will provide the Court and Respondent with specific legal citations and authority as required for hearing and briefing.)
