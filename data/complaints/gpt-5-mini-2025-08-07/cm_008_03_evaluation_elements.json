      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The allegations link the described change in circumstances to harm to Sofia\u2019s educational progress and emotional stability (truancy warnings, academic decline, lost remedial services) and explain that the requested modifications are intended to secure consistent school attendance and access to supports while preserving meaningful parenting time \u2014 establishing that the relief is alleged to be in the child\u2019s best interests (see \u00b63.3 and \u00b64)."
