  "elements": {
    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint expressly alleges a residential tenancy and lease (\u00b6\u00b6 1.1, 2.1), identifies Defendant as landlord/owner/manager of the premises (\u00b6 1.2), and alleges rent payments of $1,500/month (\u00b6 2.1). These factual allegations establish the landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads specific landlord conduct and omissions: Defendant represented the leak was \"totally fixed\" at the showing (\u00b6 2.2), then repeatedly minimized the condition and refused/took no timely adequate action to repair after notice (\u00b6\u00b6 2.3\u20132.4, 2.7). Those factual allegations adequately plead acts and omissions by the landlord."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges continuing, worsening water intrusion (\u00b6\u00b6 2.3, 2.5), damage to tenant's property (laptop ruined) (\u00b6 2.5), a persistent musty odor, and that Plaintiff now uses only about half the unit and moved his bed away from the leak area (\u00b6 2.6). Those facts reasonably allege a \"substantial interference\" with beneficial use and enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint links Defendant's representations and subsequent failure to make repairs to the ongoing leaks and resulting harms (\u00b6\u00b6 2.2\u20132.4, 2.7\u20132.8), alleging that the landlord's acts/omissions were the direct and proximate cause of the interference and property damage (\u00b6\u00b6 2.8, 3.4). These allegations adequately plead causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint specifies actual damages including $900 for the ruined laptop (\u00b6 2.5; 5.1(a)), loss of use/rent abatement (\u00b6\u00b6 2.6; 5.1(b)), expenses and other losses (\u00b6\u00b6 2.8; 5.1(c)), and requests monetary relief and injunctive relief (\u00b6\u00b6 5.1\u20135.3; Prayer). These factual allegations sufficiently plead damages."
