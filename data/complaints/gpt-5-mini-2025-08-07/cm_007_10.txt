John Mitchell

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff: Sarah Mitchell, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555-0123. Email: psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: John Mitchell, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.
1.3 Minor child: Emma Mitchell, born in 2013 (age 12).
1.4 Jurisdiction: This Court is the proper forum pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, and the Probate and Family Court’s general jurisdiction over custody matters. The existing custody order in this matter was entered by this Court on May 15, 2019, and this Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify custody orders.

2. Relief Sought
2.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint for Modification of Custody seeking (a) a change in the physical custody arrangement from the current equal 50/50 alternating-week schedule to primary physical custody with Plaintiff, with a revised reasonable parenting time schedule for Defendant that is consistent with Defendant’s documented medical limitations; (b) temporary and permanent orders limiting the Defendant’s unsupervised custodial time as necessary for the child’s safety; (c) an order directing the Defendant to comply with medical evaluations and to provide medical documentation of functional limitations; (d) such other and further relief as the Court deems necessary to protect the best interests of the child.
2.2 Plaintiff seeks the modification on the ground that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2019 custody order, warranting modification in the child’s best interests.

3. Background Facts
3.1 On May 15, 2019, this Court entered an order awarding the parties joint legal custody and equal physical custody of their child, Emma Mitchell, on a one-week-on, one-week-off alternating schedule. At the time of the order both parents lived nearby, were independently ambulatory, and shared childcare responsibilities consistent with the alternating-week schedule.
3.2 For several years the alternating-week arrangement functioned well. Emma maintained stable routines, attended school regularly, and had regular activities and relationships in both households.
3.3 Since mid-2024, Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition (hereinafter “the Condition”). The Condition has resulted in progressive mobility impairment, frequent episodes of loss of balance and falls, and increasing need for assistance with transfers (e.g., moving between wheelchair and bed, toileting, dressing).
3.4 Defendant’s treating physician has advised that Defendant should not be left alone with a child in situations involving stairs, transfers, toileting, bathing, or any situation requiring rapid physical response to prevent injury. Defendant uses a wheelchair for mobility at times and requires assistance for some transfers and for some activities of daily living.
3.5 Despite these medical limitations and medical advice, Defendant has insisted on continuing the exact same alternating-week 50/50 custody schedule and has, at times, relied on the minor child to assist with transfers and to bring items to Defendant. On multiple occasions the child has been observed assisting Defendant with physical tasks beyond a child’s appropriate role, including helping Defendant from wheelchair to bed and retrieving items that Defendant could not safely reach.
3.6 Defendant has experienced several falls while the child was present. These falls have created acute safety risks to the child. The child has expressed fear about Defendant’s falls and discomfort with having to assist Defendant. Plaintiff believes that continuing the existing 50/50 alternating-week schedule exposes the child to unreasonable risk and is not in the child’s best interests.
3.7 Plaintiff has attempted to address these concerns directly with Defendant and to propose a revised schedule that would allow Defendant meaningful parenting time consistent with Defendant’s current abilities, including shorter visits in Defendant’s home with appropriate safety accommodations, but Defendant has refused to modify the schedule or to obtain and provide detailed medical documentation.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 The Defendant’s progressive neurological diagnosis, the resulting functional limitations, the increased frequency of falls, the treating physician’s recommendations that Defendant not be left alone with the child in situations requiring rapid physical response or involving stairs or transfers, and Defendant’s reliance on the child to assist with physical tasks are a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not contemplated at the time the Court entered the May 15, 2019 custody order.
4.2 That change materially affects the child’s day-to-day safety, well-being, and environment, and therefore warrants modification of the physical custody arrangement to protect the child and to serve the child’s best interests.

5. Best Interests of the Child
5.1 Plaintiff alleges that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child for the following reasons:
    a. Safety: The child’s exposure to the risk of injury from Defendant’s falls and from situations where Defendant is not able to safely supervise or physically manage emergency situations has increased materially.
    b. Role appropriateness: The child has been placed in the role of caregiver/assistant to Defendant, which is inappropriate for a child of twelve and may be harmful to the child’s emotional and developmental welfare.
    c. Stability and routine: Primary placement with Plaintiff will preserve the child’s schooling, extracurricular activities, and routines while allowing Defendant meaningful, safe parenting time tailored to his abilities.
    d. Medical recommendations: Defendant’s treating physician’s limitations on unsupervised time with the child support a schedule that limits unsupervised higher-risk situations.
5.2 Plaintiff proposes that Defendant be awarded reasonable parenting time consistent with Defendant’s functional abilities, subject to the following conditions as the Court deems necessary: (a) reduced-duration or daytime visits in Defendant’s home that avoid stairs and transfers; (b) supervised visits if the Court finds them necessary for the child’s safety; (c) out-of-home parenting time at mutually agreed safe locations; and (d) immediate provision to the Court and to Plaintiff of medical documentation regarding Defendant’s condition, medications, and prognosis.

6. Temporary Relief Requested
6.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court enter a temporary order (pendente lite) modifying physical custody to place the child primarily with Plaintiff pending final hearing, on the grounds that there is a present risk to the child’s safety if the status quo remains in effect and that Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if temporary relief is not granted.
6.2 Plaintiff further requests that the Court order Defendant to provide to Plaintiff and the Court within 14 days of the entry of any temporary order: (a) a current letter from Defendant’s treating physician describing functional limitations and specific safety recommendations regarding unsupervised contact with the minor child; and (b) a list of necessary accommodations for safe parenting time.

7. Legal Grounds for Modification
7.1 Modification of a prior custody order is appropriate when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and when modification is in the child’s best interests. Plaintiff alleges the facts set forth above constitute such a material and substantial change and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child.
7.2 Plaintiff relies on Massachusetts statutory and case law authorities governing custody modification, best interests of the child, and the duty of the Court to protect minors from harm, as well as applicable reporting statutes requiring the investigation of suspected child endangerment. Plaintiff further requests the Court’s exercise of its continuing jurisdiction and authority to fashion parenting time that protects the child’s safety while preserving the parental relationship.

8. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
    a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the Court’s May 15, 2019 order;
    b. Modify the existing custody order to award primary physical custody of the minor child, Emma Mitchell, to Plaintiff, with joint legal custody to be retained by both parents unless the Court determines otherwise;
    c. Establish a revised parenting time schedule for Defendant that is tailored to his documented functional abilities and that may include supervised or limited visits as the Court deems necessary for the child’s safety;
    d. Order that Defendant provide to Plaintiff and the Court within 14 days current medical documentation and a written statement from treating providers regarding Defendant’s functional limitations, prognosis, and any recommended safety restrictions for childcare;
    e. Enter any temporary (pendente lite) orders necessary to protect the child’s safety pending final hearing, including immediate temporary modification of physical custody if the Court deems such relief necessary;
    f. Order that all parties comply with any evaluations (medical, psychological, or other) deemed by the Court necessary to resolve custody issues, and that the costs of such evaluations be allocated by the Court as appropriate;
    g. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

9. Notice and Filing
9.1 Plaintiff will contemporaneously file a Motion for Hearing and any supporting affidavits, medical documentation (to the extent in Plaintiff’s possession), and a proposed parenting plan consistent with the relief requested herein.
