Although it focuses on habitability rather than using the term \u2018quiet enjoyment,\u2019 it clearly supports the broader proposition on landlord duties in residential tenancies.",

Because we hold that the lease of a residential dwelling creates a contractual relationship between the landlord and tenant, the standard contract remedies of rescission, reformation and damages are available to the tenant when suing for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.\u201d"
