Michael Brown
Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Jessica Thompson, Petitioner in this action, may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com. Petitioner is a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts and is a party to the existing custody order referenced below.

1.2 Respondent: Michael Brown, Respondent in this action, is the other parent of the minor children named below. Respondent is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to the existing custody order entered in this Court.

1.3 Children: The subject children and their current ages are Emily Thompson (age 10) and Noah Thompson (age 8).

1.4 Jurisdiction and Venue: This Court has jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters concerning minor children pursuant to Massachusetts law, and venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the original custody order was entered and the children reside within this County.

2. Background / Existing Order
2.1 On April 12, 2022, this Court entered an order concerning the custody of Emily and Noah (the “Existing Order”). The Existing Order provides for joint legal custody of the children, with primary physical custody to the Petitioner (Petitioner’s home is the children’s primary residence) and regular scheduled visitation with the Respondent.

2.2 The Existing Order further provides that both parents should support the children’s relationship with each parent and refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children, and it requires the parents to cooperate in decisions affecting the children.

3. Nature of Relief Sought
3.1 Petitioner brings this Complaint for Modification of Custody pursuant to applicable Massachusetts statutes and caselaw governing modification of custody orders. Petitioner seeks:
- A finding that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order sufficient to justify modification of physical custody;
- An order awarding primary physical custody of Emily and Noah to Petitioner (with a proposed parenting time schedule to be set by the Court or by the parties consistent with the children’s best interests);
- An order clarifying decision-making authority for extracurricular activities, requiring advance written notice and either mutual agreement or a specific procedure for resolving scheduling conflicts (including priority to the custodial parent’s scheduled time absent agreement);
- An order prohibiting disparagement of one parent by the other in the presence of the children and requiring the parents to comply with parental communication protocols approved by the Court (including neutral third-party communications where appropriate);
- Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, including make-up parenting time if activities scheduled by Respondent prevent Court-ordered visitation, and attorney’s fees and costs where appropriate.

4. Factual Allegations Demonstrating Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the Existing Order, the Respondent has repeatedly engaged in conduct affecting the children’s stability, the parent-child relationship with the Petitioner, and the children’s emotional well-being, as follows:

4.2 Unilateral Scheduling of Activities During Petitioner’s Parenting Time:
- Over the past year Respondent has repeatedly enrolled Emily and Noah in extracurricular activities, lessons, and events that fall during Petitioner’s scheduled weekends and other times when the children are with Petitioner, without meaningful prior communication with or consent from Petitioner.
- Respondent has not provided timely or adequate advance notice of these activities and has refused to reschedule or obtain agreement when asked, asserting in interactions with the children that it is Petitioner’s “fault” if the children cannot attend.

4.3 Direct Disparagement and Interference with Parent-Child Relationship:
- The children have reported that Respondent calls Petitioner “selfish” and tells the children Petitioner “doesn’t really love them” when Petitioner requests cooperative arrangements or seeks to exercise her parenting time.
- Such statements and conduct directly contravene the Existing Order’s directive that parents support the children’s relationship with each parent and not disparage each other in front of the children.

4.4 Adverse Impact on Children’s Health and Adjustment:
- As a result of the foregoing conduct and repeated transitions complicated by last-minute scheduling changes and disparaging commentary, one of the children (Emily) has begun reporting recurring stomach aches on transition days and showing heightened anxiety about transfers between homes.
- The foregoing behavior by Respondent has interfered with the children’s routine and stability and has created tension and anxiety that affects the children’s health, school functioning, and emotional adjustment.

4.5 Attempts to Resolve:
- Petitioner has attempted to address these issues directly with Respondent and has sought cooperative scheduling consultation in good faith, but Respondent’s unilateral scheduling decisions and disparaging comments have continued and have not been resolved.

5. Legal Standard and Legal Basis for Relief
5.1 Modification Standard: Under Massachusetts law, modification of an existing custody order is appropriate when the party seeking modification establishes a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and that the proposed change is in the best interests of the children. Petitioner alleges the conduct described above constitutes a material change in circumstances that materially affects the welfare of the children and their relationship with Petitioner.

5.2 Best Interests of the Child: The Court’s paramount consideration in child custody matters is the best interests of the child, including consideration of the child’s safety, emotional and physical needs, stability, the child’s relationship with each parent, and the willingness and ability of each parent to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent.

5.3 Particular Relief Requested: Given Respondent’s ongoing unilateral scheduling of activities during Petitioner’s custodial time, repeated disparaging comments in the presence of the children, and demonstrated adverse effect on at least one child, Petitioner seeks modification to primary physical custody with a clear directive regarding scheduling of extracurricular activities, communication protocols, and prohibition of disparagement.

6. Material Change in Circumstances
6.1 Petitioner incorporates by reference the facts in Paragraphs 4.1–4.5 and alleges those facts establish a material change in circumstances since the Existing Order (entered April 12, 2022) sufficient to warrant modification.

6.2 The combination of (a) repeated unilateral interference with Petitioner’s custodial time through scheduling, (b) direct disparaging statements to the children that undermine the parent-child relationship and violate the Existing Order, and (c) demonstrable adverse effects on the children’s health and adjustment (e.g., stomach aches, anxiety about transitions) are material and have a substantial effect on the children’s welfare and on Petitioner’s custodial role.

7. Request for Temporary Relief
7.1 Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court consider issuing appropriate temporary relief, pending final hearing, including but not limited to:
- Temporary clarification that Petitioner is the primary physical custodian of the children and that Respondent must obtain Petitioner’s advance written consent before scheduling extracurricular activities that fall during Petitioner’s custodial time (or, absent consent, to defer such activities until a mutually agreed time);
- A temporary order prohibiting disparagement of one parent by the other in the presence of the children, pending final hearing;
- Such other temporary measures as the Court finds necessary to preserve the children’s stability and welfare.

8. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order dated April 12, 2022;
B. Modify the Existing Order to award primary physical custody of Emily (age 10) and Noah (age 8) to Petitioner, with parenting time for Respondent as the Court deems appropriate and in the children’s best interests;
C. Enter specific, enforceable orders regarding scheduling and extracurricular activities that require advance written notice of all non-school activities, require notification and good-faith consultation before enrolling the children in activities that conflict with the other parent’s custodial time, and establish a clear procedure for resolving scheduling disputes (including priority to the custodial parent’s scheduled time unless mutually agreed otherwise or except in emergencies);
D. Enter an order enjoining both parents from disparaging the other parent in view or hearing of the children and requiring compliance with neutral communication protocols (such as limiting certain communications to written form when necessary, or use of a parental communication app) to minimize conflict;
E. Award make-up parenting time or other remedial relief where Respondent’s scheduling of activities interferes with Court-ordered parenting time;
F. Grant such temporary relief as is necessary pending a final hearing, including temporary clarification of custodial status consistent with Petitioner’s requests;
G. Award Petitioner costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, as the Court deems appropriate; and
H. Grant such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

9. Notice and Service
9.1 Petitioner will serve this Complaint and notice of hearing upon Respondent at his last known address in accordance with Massachusetts law and the Probate and Family Court rules.

10. Certification
10.1 Petitioner certifies that she has attempted to resolve the issues raised in this Complaint through direct communication with Respondent, but that those attempts have not resolved the material problems identified herein.

AUTHORITY
(Authoritative legal standards commonly applied in Massachusetts custody modification matters include (among others) the statute and caselaw addressing modification of custody, best interests of the child, material change in circumstances, and enforcement of orders. The following authorities are cited for the Court’s reference.)

Statutes and Rules (Massachusetts)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 31 (statutory standards applicable to custody and visitation and the best interests of the child)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28 (general provisions applicable to domestic relations matters)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, §§ 39 et seq. (authorities concerning children and child welfare considered in custody determinations)
- Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure (applicable local rules and procedures for the Probate and Family Court)

Select Massachusetts Caselaw (representative authorities addressing modification, material change, and best interests)
- A. cases recognizing the “material change in circumstances” standard for custody modification and that the child’s best interests govern modifications;
- B. cases addressing parental alienation/disparagement and its effect on modification decisions;
- C. cases addressing the Court’s authority to allocate decision-making authority for extracurricular and school-related matters;
- D. cases recognizing temporary relief to preserve the status quo pending full hearing where modification is sought and emergency or interim measures are appropriate.

(For specific references and precise citations, counsel or the Court may consult the Massachusetts case reporters and statutory compilations. Petitioner relies on the well-settled principle—recognized in Massachusetts jurisprudence—that modification is warranted where a material change in circumstances adversely affects the child’s welfare and that the best interests of the child are the Court’s controlling consideration.)

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays that the Court grant the relief requested above.
