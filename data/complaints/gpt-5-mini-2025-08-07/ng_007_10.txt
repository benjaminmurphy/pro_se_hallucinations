COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff James Miller (“Plaintiff”) is an adult resident of Brockton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”) is an organization that owns, operates, and/or controls the community center and after-school program located at 1234 Main St, Brockton, MA 02301.

3. The events giving rise to this action occurred on September 15, 2023 at the Defendant’s facilities located at 1234 Main St, Brockton, MA 02301.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Brockton District Court because the Defendant’s premises are located in Brockton and the acts and omissions giving rise to this complaint occurred in Brockton.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son attended an after-school program at the Defendant’s community center on September 15, 2023.

6. The Defendant advertises and represents to parents and the public that children participating in the after-school program will be supervised at all times while in the facility’s gym.

7. At all times material hereto, Defendant owed a duty to supervise and protect children attending its after-school program, including Plaintiff’s son.

8. On September 15, 2023, the after-school program was staffed by two employees for approximately twenty children. One staff member left the gym area to perform paperwork in an office, leaving only one staff member physically present to supervise the children.

9. The remaining staff member was situated near the gym bleachers and was predominantly looking at her phone, rather than actively supervising the children playing on the gym floor.

10. Two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing a rough game involving full-force tackling on the hardwood gym floor.

11. Several children reported the rough conduct to the staff member, but the staff member dismissed the concerns, stating: “boys will be boys,” and took no effective action to stop the rough play.

12. As a direct result of the lack of supervision and failure to intervene, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s son with excessive force. Plaintiff’s son struck his head on the hardwood floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

13. Plaintiff’s son was transported to an emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion and received immediate medical treatment. The concussion caused pain, cognitive symptoms, missed school days, and required follow-up medical care.

14. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,000 in medical expenses related to the concussion and treatment and has suffered lost wages of approximately $1,200 as a result of time taken from work to care for his injured child.

15. The Defendant’s employees and agents negligently failed to provide the level of supervision and care required by the circumstances, and that breach of duty was a proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff’s son and of Plaintiff’s damages.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Negligence

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. At all times material to this complaint, the Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to persons lawfully on its premises, including the duty to supervise children in its after-school program, to maintain reasonably safe premises, and to protect program attendees from foreseeable risks of harm created by inadequate supervision and unregulated rough play.

18. The Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:
    a. Failing to ensure adequate staff-to-child ratios on September 15, 2023;
    b. Allowing a single staff member to supervise approximately twenty children without appropriate attention and control;
    c. Failing to properly supervise the gym area and to ensure that staff were attentive and actively monitoring children’s conduct;
    d. Failing to intervene to stop dangerous and unsupervised tackling and rough play despite being informed by other children that the play was unsafe; and
    e. Failing to promulgate, enforce, or follow reasonable safety and supervision policies and procedures for the after-school program.

19. The Defendant’s breaches were negligent and unreasonable under the circumstances and directly and proximately caused the injuries to Plaintiff’s son, the resulting medical treatment and expenses, loss of educational time, and other damages to Plaintiff and his family.

20. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained monetary damages including, but not limited to, medical expenses of approximately $5,000, lost wages of approximately $1,200, physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial but in excess of the court’s statutory minimum for jurisdiction in this Court.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for medical expenses (approximately $5,000), lost wages (approximately $1,200), pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other losses caused by Defendant’s negligence;

B. Interest on the damages allowable by law from the date of the injury;

C. Costs and disbursements of this action; and

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
