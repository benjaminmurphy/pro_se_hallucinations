COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an individual resident of Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Grocer's Market Inc. ("Defendant") is a corporation doing business as a grocery store at 123 Dairy Ave, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144. On information and belief, Defendant owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled the grocery store premises at that location on the date of the incident.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in the Somerville District Court because the incident and injuries at issue occurred in Somerville, Massachusetts and the amount in controversy (as pleaded below) is within the jurisdictional limits of this court.

4. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Dairy Ave, Somerville, MA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 16, 2023, at approximately mid–afternoon on a Saturday, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Dairy Ave in Somerville, Massachusetts, as a business invitee.

6. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk and slipped and fell, landing hard on her hip.

7. The spilled milk formed a large puddle; cart tracks were visible through the spilled milk indicating a surface of substantial size and duration.

8. There were no warning signs, cones, barriers, or other reasonably adequate warnings or directions placed by Defendant to alert customers to the hazardous condition.

9. An employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away when Plaintiff fell. After the fall, that employee told Plaintiff he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing a task before obtaining a mop and cleaning supplies.

10. Plaintiff completed her shopping that day believing she was not seriously hurt. That evening she began to experience significant hip pain.

11. On September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought treatment at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain and advised to undergo conservative treatment, including physical therapy.

12. Plaintiff subsequently completed a course of physical therapy for her hip sprain.

13. As a proximate result of the fall and the injuries suffered, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200.00 and lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,800.00 due to missing shifts at her place of employment.

14. Plaintiff continues to suffer pain, discomfort, and limitations resulting from the hip sprain and has incurred other general damages including loss of enjoyment of life and emotional distress.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all times material hereto, Defendant owed Plaintiff and other business invitees a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or make safe dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or should have known. This duty included a duty to inspect the premises, to discover dangerous conditions (such as spills), and to take reasonable steps to correct or warn of those conditions within a reasonable time. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duty with respect to conditions on land).

17. Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:
    a. permitting a hazardous condition (a puddle of spilled milk of substantial size) to remain on the premises;
    b. failing to warn invitees of the hazardous condition by posting signs, cones, or other warnings;
    c. failing to exercise reasonable care in inspecting the premises and discovering the spill and cleaning it up in a reasonable time; and
    d. otherwise failing to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for its invitees.

18. Defendant knew or, by the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the dangerous condition because the spill was of sufficient size to show cart tracks and was observable by employees and management; indeed, an employee admitted he had noticed the spill “a few minutes” before but delayed cleaning.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining a hip sprain that required medical attention and physical therapy.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and continues to sustain:
    a. past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (past medical expenses are approximately $1,200.00);
    b. lost wages in an amount to be proven at trial (past lost wages are approximately $1,800.00);
    c. pain and suffering, disability, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in amounts to be determined at trial; and
    d. costs and interest as allowed by law.

21. Plaintiff’s damages were directly caused by Defendant’s negligence and were not the result of any act or omission of Plaintiff. To the extent comparative negligence principles may apply, Plaintiff alleges she exercised reasonable care for her own safety at all times and that any alleged negligence on her part, if any, was not a proximate cause of her injuries. (Massachusetts applies comparative negligence principles; see M.G.L. c. 231, § 85.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Grocer's Market Inc. as follows:

A. For compensatory damages, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other general and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including past medical expenses of approximately $1,200.00 and past lost wages of approximately $1,800.00;

B. For costs, interest, and allowable fees to the extent permitted by law;

C. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025
