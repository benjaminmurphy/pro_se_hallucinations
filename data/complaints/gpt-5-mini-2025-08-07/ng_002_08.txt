COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident of Newton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff's telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and her email is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Sullivan ("Defendant") is an individual who resides and/or may be served in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law because this is a civil action seeking damages for personal injuries sustained in Newton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff brings this action in the Newton District Court because the incident and all relevant facts giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton and the amount in controversy is within this Court’s jurisdictional limits.

4. Venue is proper in Newton District Court under Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this complaint occurred at Parks and Recreation Trails, 45 Park Ave, Newton, Massachusetts (the "Park").

FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately mid‑afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a marked public path within the Park.

6. The Park has posted signs on and near the jogging path requiring that all dogs be kept on a leash.

7. Defendant is the owner and/or custodian of a large dog that Defendant customarily allowed to run loose in the Park despite the posted leash requirement.

8. On September 15, 2023, Defendant was present in an area of the Park approximately thirty (30) feet from the jogging path, conversing with friends. Defendant was holding his dog’s leash over his shoulder but had not attached the leash to the dog or otherwise controlled the dog.

9. Without warning, Defendant’s dog charged toward the jogging path where Plaintiff was running, barking loudly and pursuing in a manner that caused Plaintiff to reasonably fear imminent harm from the animal.

10. Fearing that the dog would bite or otherwise attack her, Plaintiff swerved off the paved path to avoid the dog. While doing so, Plaintiff’s foot struck an exposed tree root on the side of the path and she fell down a small embankment.

11. As a result of that fall, Plaintiff suffered a fractured wrist. Defendant’s dog did not actually make contact with Plaintiff; it halted after Plaintiff fell and Defendant then called the dog back.

12. Several other joggers witnessed the incident and observed Defendant’s dog charging Plaintiff while Defendant stood unsecured and at a distance with the leash not attached to the dog.

13. Plaintiff was transported to an emergency room, received treatment, and was required to wear a brace for several weeks. Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,500 in wages because she missed work and missed a piano recital for which she had been preparing.

14. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct in failing to keep his dog leashed and under control as required by the Park’s posted rules and customary standards of care for dog owners in a public place.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a person owed a duty to others to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. This duty includes a duty by dog owners and custodians to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm caused by their animals, including keeping animals leashed and under control in places where the public reasonably expects to be safe. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 518, 315–318 (general principles of liability for animals and negligent conduct); Massachusetts Civil Jury Instructions (MCJI) (negligence elements).

17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injury to members of the public using the Park, including exercising control over his dog and complying with posted leash rules.

18. Defendant breached the duty of care by, among other things:
    a. allowing his dog to run loose in a public park where leash rules were posted;
    b. failing to attach the leash to or otherwise control the dog while the dog was in the vicinity of a public jogging path;
    c. failing to take prompt and reasonable action to restrain the dog when it charged toward members of the public, including Plaintiff.

19. Defendant’s breach was the proximate and direct cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting fractured wrist were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to control his dog. By permitting the dog to run loose and approach the path in a menacing manner, Defendant created the risk that a passerby might attempt to avoid the animal and could suffer harm in doing so.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:
    a. a fractured wrist;
    b. medical and related expenses in the approximate amount of $3,200;
    c. lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,500;
    d. pain, suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, impairment of enjoyment of life, and other non‑economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

21. Plaintiff claims damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including general and special damages, costs, prejudgment and post-judgment interest, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:
    1. medical expenses (approximately $3,200);
    2. lost wages (approximately $1,500);
    3. compensation for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non‑economic damages;

B. For costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent allowed by law;

C. For prejudgment interest and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
