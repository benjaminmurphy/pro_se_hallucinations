Mark Johnson
Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner. Laura Martinez ("Petitioner" or "Mother"), residing at an address on file with the Court, is the primary residential parent of the minor child named below and is the party seeking modification of the existing custody order. Petitioner may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2 Respondent. Mark Johnson ("Respondent" or "Father"), is the other parent of the child subject to this action. Respondent has parenting time under the existing custody order and resides within the jurisdiction of this Court.

1.3 Child. This action concerns the custody and care of the parties' minor child:
- Sofia Johnson, born in 2015 (age 10).

1.4 Jurisdiction and venue. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts General Laws, and venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior custody order was entered in Massachusetts, the child resides in this county, and both parties are subject to the Court's jurisdiction. The current custody judgment at issue was entered on May 15, 2022.

2. Background and existing order
2.1 On May 15, 2022, the Probate and Family Court entered a final custody order (the "Order") providing that the parties share legal custody of Sofia, that Petitioner is the primary residential parent, and that Respondent has substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sunday nights. The Order includes a provision that the parties shall cooperate on school matters and keep each other informed regarding the child's school attendance, academic progress, and school-related services.

2.2 At the time the Order was entered, Sofia was attending school regularly and performing satisfactorily academically.

3. Grounds for modification: material change in circumstances
3.1 Legal standard. By statute and controlling Massachusetts precedent, modification of a final custody order requires a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28; see also relevant caselaw and authority cited below.

3.2 Material change in circumstances. Since entry of the Order, a material change in circumstances has occurred affecting Sofia's health, safety, welfare, and educational stability, namely:

a. Repeated unexcused school absences attributable to Respondent's conduct. Over the past year Respondent has on a recurring basis kept Sofia home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, stating that Sofia "needs a mental health day." These absences are not supported by medical documentation. Respondent has not provided written medical excuses or other credible documentation justifying the frequent Monday absences.

b. Decline in academic performance and school-based warnings. As a direct consequence of the increased absences, Sofia's grades and standardized test scores have declined over the past year. The school has issued truancy warnings and communicated concerns to Petitioner regarding Sofia's attendance and academic decline.

c. Interference with school-related remedial services. Respondent regularly refuses to transport Sofia to scheduled tutoring sessions or otherwise prevent her attendance at school-based remedial services when those services occur during his parenting time, undermining Sofia's ability to recover academically.

d. Failure to cooperate on school matters. Respondent's unilateral decisions and actions concerning Sofia's attendance and tutoring contradict the parties' shared-custody cooperation provisions and the child's educational needs, and constitute a change in circumstances material to the child's welfare since entry of the Order.

3.3 Best interests of the child. The change in circumstances described above materially affects Sofia's best interests. Regular school attendance and participation in remedial academic supports are essential to Sofia's educational progress, emotional stability, and future well-being. The requested modification seeks to secure Sofia's consistent school attendance and access to tutoring while preserving meaningful parenting time with Respondent that does not interfere with school attendance and services.

4. Relief requested
WHEREFORE, Petitioner asks the Court to modify the May 15, 2022 custody order as follows:

4.1 Primary relief — educational decision-making authority. Award Petitioner sole authority to make final decisions regarding Sofia's school attendance, tutoring, academic placement, and participation in school-based services, or in the alternative, award Petitioner final decision-making authority on issues relating to school attendance and remedial academic services (including the right to require medical documentation for excused absences).

4.2 Parenting-time modification (alternative or in addition). Modify Respondent's parenting time to eliminate or substantially reduce overnights that include school nights (including return on Sunday evenings) if such overnights are likely to interfere with Sofia's school attendance or tutoring, and/or require that any weekend parenting time be structured so that it does not result in missed school days (for example, by returning Sofia to Petitioner before Sunday evening or otherwise accommodating school attendance and tutoring schedules).

4.3 Preventive/protective terms. Order that Respondent must provide notice and documentation of any proposed absence from school (including medical notes where appropriate), must cooperate with scheduled school services and tutoring, and must produce Sofia for all scheduled school days and tutoring unless a licensed medical or mental health professional documents the child's need for absence. Temporarily issue any necessary protective order as appropriate to effectuate these requirements pending final hearing.

4.4 Case management and monitoring. Order appropriate case management measures including, as the Court deems appropriate, an educational evaluation, participation of a court-appointed guardian ad litem or guardian ad litem investigator, or referral to the Court Service Center for parenting-time adjustment and education coordination.

4.5 Other relief. Grant such other and further relief as the Court finds just and proper, including costs, and any further limitations or conditions on Respondent's parenting time necessary to ensure Sofia's regular school attendance and academic recovery.

5. Basis for emergency/expedited relief (if applicable)
5.1 Because the child's school attendance and academic standing continue to deteriorate and the school has issued truancy warnings, Petitioner requests that the Court schedule an expedited hearing and consider temporary, emergency relief as necessary to prevent further, ongoing harm to Sofia's education and welfare while the modification is pending.

6. Notice and request for hearing
6.1 Petitioner requests a prompt hearing on this Complaint and that the Court schedule such pre-hearing conferences and evaluations as it deems appropriate under the Probate and Family Court rules and practice.

7. Verification and certification
7.1 Petitioner certifies under penalty of perjury that the statements in this Complaint are true and accurate to the best of her knowledge.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:
a. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2022 custody order;
b. Modify the existing custody/parenting-time order as requested in paragraph 4 above to protect Sofia's best interests and secure her school attendance and academic needs;
c. Grant temporary and/or emergency relief as necessary pending final hearing; and
d. Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

Dated: December 1, 2025
