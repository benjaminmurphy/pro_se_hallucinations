    "landlord_tenant_relationship": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant is owner/landlord who rents the Premises to Plaintiff (\u00b62), parties entered a residential tenancy commencing June 1, 2022 and Plaintiff occupies the unit and pays monthly rent (\u00b6\u00b63,6). These facts pled a landlord\u2013tenant relationship."
    },
    "act_or_omission_by_landlord": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Plaintiff notified Defendant of mold and requested remediation (\u00b69); Defendant inspected and cleaned visible mold but refused to repair or upgrade ventilation and blamed Plaintiff (\u00b610); Defendant has refused further remediation despite notice and requests (\u00b615). Those allegations sufficiently plead a landlord omission/refusal to act."
    },
    "substantial_interference": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges persistent and worsening mold spreading from the shower to the ceiling in an interior bathroom with only an exhaust fan (\u00b6\u00b65,7\u20138), alleges the conditions have \u201csubstantially and unreasonably interfered\u201d with Plaintiff\u2019s quiet, comfortable and safe possession (\u00b614), and alleges new respiratory symptoms and loss of use of property items (\u00b6\u00b612\u201313). Those facts support a pleading-level showing of substantial interference with quiet enjoyment."
    },
    "causation": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the landlord\u2019s refusal to remediate and to provide adequate ventilation is the reason the mold persisted (\u00b6\u00b69\u201311,15\u201316), the treating clinician linked Plaintiff\u2019s new symptoms to mold exposure (\u00b612), and the complaint expressly pleads that Defendant\u2019s conduct was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff\u2019s damages (\u00b6\u00b616,21). These allegations adequately plead causation at the complaint stage."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete harms: new respiratory symptoms and medical treatment (\u00b612), disposal of moldy shower curtain and towels at a loss of \u2248$60 (\u00b613), diminution in value/habitability and loss of the benefit of quiet enjoyment (\u00b616), and seeks at least $200 plus additional damages (\u00b622). These allegations sufficiently plead damages."
