Docket No.: ___________________

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1.     Parties

1.1    Plaintiff Sarah Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Johnson”) is an individual and a tenant residing at 123 Green Street, Apartment (Studio), Jamaica Plain, MA 02130. Plaintiff is proceeding pro se.

1.2    Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Thompson”) is the owner and landlord of the dwelling unit located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”) and at all times relevant was the landlord of the Premises and the party with whom Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement.

2.     Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to its statutory and general landlord-tenant jurisdiction, including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process), and the rules establishing the Boston Housing Court’s jurisdiction over landlord-tenant matters.

2.2    Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, which is within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court.

3.     Facts

3.1    On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff began renting a studio apartment at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 from Defendant. The monthly rent for the Premises is $1,500.00.

3.2    Prior to signing the lease and taking possession, Plaintiff attended a showing of the Premises and observed water stains on the ceiling in the main living/sleeping area. Plaintiff inquired about the stains, and Defendant expressly represented that the stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.” Relying on Defendant’s representation, Plaintiff entered into the tenancy.

3.3    During the first major rainstorm after Plaintiff moved in, water began dripping through the ceiling at the exact location of the previously-observed stains. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the leak and the presence of active water intrusion.

3.4    Over the ensuing months Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant of continuing water intrusion and of subsequent leaks in the same location. Defendant repeatedly dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints, calling the condition a “minor cosmetic issue” and stating that Plaintiff understood the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.

3.5    The water intrusion worsened over time. During one storm the leak soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined Plaintiff’s laptop, which cost approximately $900.00 to replace. Plaintiff has provided or will provide photographic evidence of the leaks, damage to personal property, and communications to Defendant notifying him of the leaks.

3.6    As a result of the ongoing leaks there is now a persistent musty odor and Plaintiff has experienced headaches that she reasonably attributes to mold or damp conditions associated with Defendant’s failure to remedy the leak and resulting conditions. Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed away from the affected area and is effectively confined to using roughly half of the Premises for normal living activities.

3.7    Despite notice and Plaintiff’s repeated requests for repair, Defendant failed and refused to reasonably and promptly repair the leak or otherwise eliminate the water intrusion and related habitability concerns. Defendant has therefore unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s possession and enjoyment of the Premises.

4.     Cause of Action — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law)

4.1    Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1.1 through 3.7 above as if set forth fully herein.

4.2    Under Massachusetts law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment exists in residential tenancies. The covenant guarantees that the tenant may possess and use the leased premises free from substantial interference by the landlord or by conditions the landlord causes or fails to remedy when the landlord has the duty and opportunity to do so.

4.3    Defendant’s representations prior to lease entry, his subsequent knowledge of ongoing water intrusion at a point previously represented to be “totally fixed,” and his repeated refusal to perform timely and adequate repairs despite notice and opportunity to do so constitute a breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment of the leased Premises.

4.4    Defendant’s conduct substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the Premises: water intrusion damaged Plaintiff’s personal property (including a laptop costing approximately $900.00), created a persistent musty odor and health-related symptoms that have caused Plaintiff to rearrange her living space and to forego use of a substantial portion of the Premises.

4.5    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages for the loss of use of the Premises, damage to personal property, and other compensable harm in an amount to be proved at trial but presently estimated at $900.00 for the damaged laptop and seeking such additional compensatory damages and rent abatement as the Court deems appropriate.

4.6    Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, costs of suit, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

5.     Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

a.     For compensatory damages in an amount to be proved at trial, including but not limited to $900.00 for Plaintiff’s damaged laptop and other property damage and losses attributable to Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

b.     For an award of a reasonable abatement of rent or damages for loss of use of a portion of the Premises during the period of Defendant’s breach, in an amount to be proved at trial;

c.     For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

d.     For costs of suit and court filing fees;

e.     For such other relief as the Court deems equitable and just, including declaratory relief identifying Defendant’s continuing obligations to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and an order requiring Defendant to make necessary repairs; and

f.     For any further relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled.

6.     Demand for Jury Trial

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

Plaintiff, pro se

Authoritative legal authorities commonly applied to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and to landlord-tenant habitability claims in Massachusetts (for Plaintiff’s convenience):

Statutes, regulations, and codes
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general landlord-tenant law)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process) (Boston Housing Court jurisdiction over landlord-tenant matters)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act) (general statutory authority sometimes referenced in landlord-tenant contexts)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (Public Health) (public health authority applicable to dwelling conditions)
- State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation)
- 780 CMR (Massachusetts State Building Code)

Secondary authority
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (authoritative treatise on landlord-tenant covenants, including the covenant of quiet enjoyment)
- Boston Housing Court Rules and standing orders (procedural rules applicable to matters filed in this Court)

Note regarding legal citations and authority: The complaint above asserts a single cause of action — breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment — and relies on Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and applicable habitability standards. If you would like, I can (a) add pinpoint statutory subsections and specific Massachusetts cases interpreting and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment (SJC and Appeals Court authority), including cases addressing rent abatement, damage to personal property, and health/habitability issues, or (b) convert this into a printable court-ready pleading with a blank docket number, a proposed summons, and a certificate of service. Because I am acting here as a legal-document drafter for you and you are representing yourself, I have not included attorney-only arguments or attorney fees requests that require specific statutory predicates. If you would like me to add specific Massachusetts case law citations and precise statutory subsections, I can prepare a revised version — but I recommend, if possible, having any added case law verified by an attorney or law clerk before filing to ensure that the particular cases and sections cited are the most on-point authorities for the covenant-of-quiet-enjoyment claim in Massachusetts courts.
