COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, pro se, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Somerville Grocery Store LLC, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is a resident of Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Somerville Grocery Store LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns and operates a grocery store located at 150 Washington St, Somerville, MA 02143, where the events giving rise to this action occurred.

3. The injury and damages alleged herein arose in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Middlesex County and this Court pursuant to the Massachusetts venue statutes and rules and the residence and location of the events that gave rise to this action. See, e.g., Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(b), M.G.L. c. 223, § 2.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action brought under Massachusetts negligence law.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 12, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon on a Saturday, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of the Defendant at 150 Washington St., Somerville, Massachusetts, as a business invitee to shop.

6. While lawfully in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a significant puddle of spilled milk in the aisle. The puddle was visibly large enough that cart tracks could be seen running through it.

7. There were no signs, cones, or other warnings (e.g., “wet floor” signs) or physical barriers present to warn invitees of the spilled milk or otherwise to prevent access to the hazardous condition.

8. An employee of the Defendant was approximately fifteen (15) feet away stocking shelves at the time of the incident. After the fall, that employee approached Plaintiff and stated that he had “noticed the spill a few minutes ago” but had been finishing what he was doing and was going to get a mop thereafter.

9. Defendant’s employee thus had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition (the spilled milk) and/or the condition had existed for a sufficient time that the Defendant reasonably should have discovered and remedied the condition (constructive notice). In either event, the Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to correct the dangerous condition or to warn invitees.

10. As a direct and proximate result of stepping in the spilled milk and falling, Plaintiff fell heavily onto her hip and sustained bodily injuries, including a hip sprain requiring medical care and subsequent physical therapy.

11. Plaintiff sought urgent care on August 13, 2023 and was diagnosed with a hip sprain. Plaintiff thereafter required and underwent a course of physical therapy.

12. Plaintiff missed several shifts at her place of employment (a café) as a direct result of the injury and recovery, sustaining lost wages.

13. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500.00 in medical and related out-of-pocket expenses as a direct result of the incident, and has suffered lost wages of approximately $1,200.00 to date. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and suffering and has sustained other general damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability) — Defendant Somerville Grocery Store LLC

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land (including a business open to the public) owes invitees the duty to use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of known dangerous conditions or those which the possessor should have known about through the exercise of reasonable care. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; Massachusetts Civil Jury Instructions (negligence/premises liability principles); see also cases construing and applying these principles under Massachusetts law.

16. The Defendant, as owner and operator of the grocery store, owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition, including discovering and remedying spills and other dangerous conditions in aisles used by customers and to warn patrons of known hazards.

17. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to (a) properly maintain its premises in a safe condition, (b) discover and promptly remedy or barricade the spilled milk, (c) place warning signs or otherwise warn patrons of the hazard, and (d) exercise reasonable care in supervising and training employees charged with the responsibility of keeping aisles free of hazards.

18. The Defendant had actual and/or constructive notice of the spilled milk. Defendant’s employee acknowledged he had “noticed the spill a few minutes ago,” demonstrating that the Defendant had actual notice and failed to act. Even if the employee’s statement is credited as establishing only constructive notice, the condition existed for a sufficient period such that, in the exercise of reasonable care, the Defendant should have discovered and cleaned the spill and/or warned patrons.

19. The Defendant’s breach of its duties was a proximate and legal cause of Plaintiff’s fall, hip sprain, need for medical care and physical therapy, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages.

20. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages including, without limitation: past and future medical expenses (approximately $2,500.00 to date), past lost wages of approximately $1,200.00, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and other compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
