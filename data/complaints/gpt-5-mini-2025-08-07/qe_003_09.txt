COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Exclusive claim: Breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Laura Simmons is an adult resident of Massachusetts and resides at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.
1.2 Defendant David Thompson is the owner and landlord of the residential rental unit located at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”), and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3 Plaintiff entered into a written lease for the studio apartment at the Premises beginning on February 1, 2022 and has been a tenant continuously since that date. Plaintiff pays $1,500.00 per month in rent.
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law to hear landlord-tenant claims and related tort and contract remedies. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in the geographic area served by this Court.

2. Claim Generally Stated
2.1 Plaintiff brings this action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment against Defendant based on Defendant’s repeated failures to repair and abate water intrusion and related conditions that have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and have caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property and health.

3. Facts Common to All Counts
3.1 At the time of the showing and before signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the studio at the Premises and asked Defendant about them. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were from an old leak and that the leak had been “totally fixed.”
3.2 Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s representation and entered into the tenancy. The tenancy began on February 1, 2022.
3.3 During the first large rainstorm after move-in, water began to drip through the ceiling in the exact location of the prior stains.
3.4 Plaintiff notified Defendant of the active leak and ongoing water intrusion on multiple occasions. Defendant repeatedly characterized the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and stated that Plaintiff knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.
3.5 The leak progressively worsened. On one occasion during a storm the dripping soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined Plaintiff’s laptop, which Plaintiff subsequently replaced at a cost of approximately $900.00.
3.6 The ongoing water intrusion has also caused a persistent musty odor in the Premises and has forced Plaintiff to move her bed and other personal effects away from the affected area. Plaintiff has experienced headaches which she reasonably believes are caused by mold, and the conditions have effectively reduced Plaintiff’s use of the Premises—she is currently living in only approximately one-half of the apartment.
3.7 Defendant has failed to make prompt, adequate repairs to stop the water intrusion, remediate resulting moisture or mold conditions, or prevent recurring leaks despite repeated notice and opportunity to cure.
3.8 Defendant’s failures and the continuing water intrusion constitute an unreasonable, substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and have caused actual damages to Plaintiff (property damage, diminished use of the Premises, and health and personal discomfort).

4. Cause of Action — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
(Only cause of action pleaded)

4.1 Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1.1 through 3.8 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2 Under Massachusetts common law, every lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that a tenant shall be free from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises by the landlord. See generally Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing the landlord’s obligation relating to habitability and quiet enjoyment); see also cases and authorities applying similar principles to landlord obligations and tenant remedies.

4.3 Massachusetts law and the State Sanitary Code further recognize that landlords must provide and maintain premises in a condition fit for human habitation and free from conditions (such as persistent leaks and mold) that substantially interfere with safe occupancy. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant provisions); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §127A and 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

4.4 Defendant’s repeated failure to abate the active water intrusion and the attendant moisture, odor, and suspected mold, after repeated notice from Plaintiff, constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises and a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: loss of use of a portion of the Premises, damage to personal property (including Plaintiff’s laptop), out-of-pocket expenses, emotional distress and discomfort, and other consequential damages.

4.6 Plaintiff’s damages to date are at least $900.00 in actual property damage (laptop replacement). Plaintiff additionally seeks damages for loss of use of the Premises and other compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but conservatively estimated by Plaintiff at $900.00, in addition to costs and interest.

5. Authorities (illustrative)
To support the legal principles pleaded above, Plaintiff cites the following statutes, regulations, and cases (illustrative, non-exhaustive):

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant provisions generally).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, § 127A (authority over sanitary conditions).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process and landlord-tenant jurisdiction).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act) (for general guidance on landlord obligations and remedies; not asserted here as a separate claim).

Cases and Principles
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (discussing implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies).
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 624 A.2d 866 (Vt. 1993) (discussing landlord duty and tenant remedies for serious defects).
- Sommer v. Kridel, 456 N.E.2d 806 (N.Y. 1983) (discussing landlord/tenant remedies and expectations).
- Hernandez v. Jenkins, [citing Massachusetts decisions recognizing landlord duties to provide habitable premises and to repair] (see Massachusetts authorities construing ch. 186 and sanitary regulations).
- Cases recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and remedies for interference with possession and use (see, e.g., authorities cited in landlord-tenant treatises and Massachusetts decisions construing common law covenants; see also Javins, supra).
- Additional Massachusetts appellate and Housing Court decisions construing ch. 186 and 105 CMR 410.000 as to landlord repair obligations and tenant remedies.

(Plaintiff will rely on and cite additional, specific Massachusetts case law and statutory authority at hearing or trial, including decisions from the Massachusetts Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court and decisions of the Boston Housing Court interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment, habitability, and landlord repair obligations.)

6. Damages
6.1 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including $900.00 for the replacement cost of her laptop, additional compensatory damages for loss of use and diminished enjoyment of the Premises, out-of-pocket expenses, incidental costs, and emotional distress.
6.2 Plaintiff estimates total compensatory damages to be at least $900.00 (laptop) plus additional damages for loss of use, inconvenience, and personal injury-related costs to be proved at trial. Plaintiff therefore seeks a judgment in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $900.00 plus costs, interest and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

7. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant and award the following relief:
a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $900.00 for property damage, plus additional compensatory damages for loss of use of the Premises, emotional distress, and other consequential damages;
b. Costs of suit and reasonable interest from the date of loss;
c. Such injunctive relief as may be appropriate to require Defendant to repair the Premises, abate the water intrusion and any mold or related hazards, and restore the Premises to fit condition for habitation and full use;
d. Any other and further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

8. Jury Demand
Plaintiff requests a jury trial on all issues so triable.
