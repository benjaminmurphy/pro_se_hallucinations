Habib concerns a federal statutory-interpretation question about whether Congress, in authorizing housing code enforcement and providing an eviction mechanism, allows retaliatory eviction; it does not address Massachusetts law, the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment, or landlord liability for failure to abate nuisances. The quoted concurrence only states that Congress cannot be read to permit retaliatory eviction, which is a different concept from a tenant\u2019s right to be free of substantial interference from the landlord\u2019s failure to act. Thus, this case does not support the specific proposition cited.",

It does not discuss Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment, or nuisance-based liability for substantial interference with use and enjoyment caused by a landlord\u2019s failure to abate conditions. Its focus is on habitability and rent/ damages remedies, not on quiet enjoyment or nuisance principles, so it does not support the specific proposition stated.",

This warranty of habitability is implied in tenancies for a specific period or at will. Additionally, the implied warranty of habitability covers all latent and patent defects in the essential facilities of the residential unit."
