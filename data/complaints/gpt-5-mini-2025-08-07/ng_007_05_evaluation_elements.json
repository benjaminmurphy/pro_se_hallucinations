    "duty": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant owns/operates the after\u2011school program and premises (\u00b62, \u00b64), holds itself out as supervising children (\u00b65), and expressly alleges a duty to exercise reasonable care and supervise children (\u00b612, \u00b616). Those facts adequately plead a duty to protect invitee children."
    },
    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges concrete failures: insufficient staffing (\u00b66), an inattentive lone staffer (\u00b67), dismissive non\u2011response to reports of dangerous conduct (\u00b68), and enumerates specific breaches (\u00b613(a)\u2013(g)). These factual allegations adequately plead breach of the asserted supervisory and premises duties."
    },
    "causation_but_for": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges that, as a direct result of inadequate supervision and failure to intervene, an older boy tackled the Child causing him to strike his head and suffer a concussion (\u00b69, \u00b614, \u00b618). Those allegations sufficiently plead that the injury would not have occurred but for Defendant\u2019s alleged failures."
    },
    "causation_proximate": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges the dangerous activity (rough/tackle play) was known/foreseeable given the ages/number of children and inadequate supervision (\u00b65\u20139, \u00b612\u201313) and that the staff\u2019s inaction foreseeably allowed the injurious tackle. Those facts adequately plead proximate (foreseeable) causation."
    },
    "damages": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads specific, actual damages: Child\u2019s concussion and loss of consciousness, ER treatment, approximately $4,500 in medical expenses, approximately $1,200 in lost wages, missed school, and ongoing non\u2011economic harms (\u00b69\u201311, \u00b614, \u00b619). These allegations sufficiently plead damages."
