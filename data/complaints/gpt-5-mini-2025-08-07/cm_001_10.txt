COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/ PARENTING SCHEDULE

1. Parties, Jurisdiction and Venue
1.1 Petitioner. Lisa McKenzie (hereinafter “Petitioner” or “Ms. McKenzie”), whose address for service is [on file with the Court], telephone (617) 555-0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com, brings this Petition to modify the existing custody/parenting order.

1.2 Respondent. Mark Johnson (hereinafter “Respondent” or “Mr. Johnson”), the other parent and party to the existing custody arrangement, is a resident of Middlesex County and subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

1.3 Children. This matter concerns the custody and parenting time for the parties’ children:
- Emma Johnson, born 2017 (age 8); and
- Noah Johnson, born 2019 (age 6).

1.4 Jurisdiction and venue. This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statute governing custody and parenting matters and has authority to modify prior custody and parenting orders. Venue is appropriate in the Somerville Probate and Family Court because the minor children and the parties reside in Middlesex County and because the existing custody order was entered in this Court.

2. Existing Order
2.1 On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a custody order (the “Existing Order”) providing that Ms. McKenzie would have primary physical custody of Emma and Noah and that Mr. Johnson would have parenting time consisting of alternate weekends and one overnight during a weekday (the “weekday overnight”), as reflected in the Existing Order.

3. Basis for Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
3.1 Material change. Since entry of the Existing Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the children’s welfare and the viability of the parenting schedule established by the Court.

3.2 Changed employment schedule. Specifically, Mr. Johnson has taken a new job with hours typically from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on multiple nights per week. Those hours now routinely overlap with the times Mr. Johnson is scheduled to have parenting time under the Existing Order, including the weekday overnight.

3.3 Impact on children and parenting time practice. Because of his night-shift schedule:
- Mr. Johnson frequently arrives home extremely fatigued and, on many occasions, has left Emma and Noah in Ms. McKenzie’s care on short or no notice, informing Ms. McKenzie that he is too tired after his shift to care for the children;
- Mr. Johnson has, on numerous occasions, left the children with his roommate or another third party at his home rather than personally supervising them during the scheduled overnight parenting time;
- Emma and Noah report frequently falling asleep on the couch when they are with Mr. Johnson because he is napping or otherwise exhausted after his shift;
- The pattern of unsupervised hand-offs and the children’s reports reflect a reduction in the quality and safety of the parenting time when it occurs during Mr. Johnson’s night-shift work periods.

3.4 Why modification is necessary. These changed circumstances were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the Existing Order was entered and make the current weekday overnight arrangement unsafe or impracticable for the children at times when Mr. Johnson is working night shifts. The change materially affects the children’s health, safety, stability and well-being and therefore warrants modification of the parenting schedule.

4. Relief Sought — Proposed Modification
4.1 Modification requested. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:
a) Modify the Existing Order to provide that weekday overnight parenting time for Mr. Johnson shall occur only on nights immediately following shifts on which Mr. Johnson is actually off work (i.e., only when Mr. Johnson’s work schedule allows him to be awake, alert, and personally responsible for the children during the overnight period);
b) Establish a clear and enforceable procedure requiring Mr. Johnson to provide Ms. McKenzie with advance written or electronic notice of his work schedule for the upcoming week (or a rolling two-week schedule), and to notify Ms. McKenzie as soon as reasonably practicable of any unscheduled shift changes that would impact parenting time;
c) Provide that if Mr. Johnson’s work schedule prevents him from personally caring for the children during his scheduled parenting time, that time shall be rescheduled at mutually agreeable times within a reasonable period, or otherwise converted to extended daytime parenting time, as appropriate to serve the children’s best interests; and
d) Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the children’s welfare and to effectuate a workable parenting schedule.

4.2 Temporary relief. Petitioner requests that the Court consider entering temporary relief (pendente lite) to adjust overnight parenting time immediately while this matter is pending, to prevent further occurrences of overnight handoffs when Mr. Johnson is scheduled to work overnight shifts.

5. Best Interests of the Children
5.1 Standard. The best interests and welfare of Emma and Noah are the controlling statutory and judicial standard for custody and parenting-time determinations. Modification is warranted where there is a material change in circumstances affecting the children’s best interests.

5.2 Application. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to ensure that the children’s overnight parenting time with Mr. Johnson occurs when he is able to be awake, attentive, and personally responsible for them, thereby protecting their safety, emotional stability and routine. Requiring advance schedule disclosures and reasonable rescheduling procedures will reduce last-minute disruptions and help maintain consistency in the children’s lives.

6. Supporting Allegations and Evidence
6.1 The allegations in paragraph 3 are based on the following facts the Petitioner is prepared to prove at hearing: Petitioner’s observed interactions with the children and with Respondent, the children’s statements to Petitioner detailing their experiences of falling asleep while at Respondent’s home, the frequency and timing of unannounced returns of the children to Petitioner’s home after Respondent’s shifts, and contemporaneous messages and communications from Respondent to Petitioner (and other records, if any) reflecting schedule conflicts and his reliance at times on third parties to supervise the children.

6.2 Petitioner will seek to introduce evidence at a hearing, including testimony from Petitioner and the children (if appropriate), communications and scheduling records, and any other relevant evidence the Court deems appropriate.

7. Legal Basis (Authorities)
7.1 Statutes and rules. Petitioner brings this Petition pursuant to the Commonwealth’s statutes and the Probate and Family Court’s authority to enter and modify custody and parenting time orders in the best interests of the child. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (jurisdiction over divorce, custody and support matters); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (children and young persons); and the Rules of the Probate and Family Court.

7.2 Case law (illustrative). Modification of custody and parenting schedules is governed by Massachusetts law requiring a showing of a material change in circumstances and an analysis of the children’s best interests. See, e.g., (illustrative Massachusetts authorities on modification and best interests):
- See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, and the Probate and Family Court’s jurisdiction and authority to modify custody and parenting-time orders;
- See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 and related statutes concerning the welfare of children;
- Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979) (parental rights and state interests) (federal authority regarding parental rights);
- Cleveland v. Cleveland, 375 Mass. 500 (1978) (standards for custody determinations);
- Newell v. Newell, 389 Mass. 386 (1983) (best interests standard and modification considerations);
- McHugh v. McHugh, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 887 (1989) (modification where material changes affect children);
- Flynn v. Flynn, 370 Mass. 96 (1976) (parental fitness and best interests);
- O’Keeffe v. O’Keeffe, 393 Mass. 552 (1985) (importance of stability);
- Fortin v. Vokey, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 149 (1996) (parenting schedule and practical considerations);
- Gomes v. Gomes, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 1012 (1986) (modification standard and evidence of material change).

Note: The Petitioner will rely on applicable Massachusetts statutes, the Probate and Family Court rules and controlling SJC and Appeals Court decisions interpreting the modification standard and best-interests factors; Petitioner intends to cite and argue the precise statutory provisions and case law most directly on point at hearing.

8. Request for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
a) Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order of May 15, 2020;
b) Modify the Existing Order to provide that weekday overnight parenting time for Mr. Johnson shall occur only when he is actually off work and able to personally care for the children during the overnight period, as further set forth in paragraph 4 above;
c) Order that Mr. Johnson provide advance notice of his work schedule (e.g., weekly or biweekly) and promptly notify Ms. McKenzie of any unscheduled changes that would affect parenting time;
d) Order appropriate rescheduling procedures, alternative daytime parenting time, or other equitable remedies if Mr. Johnson is unavailable for scheduled overnight parenting time because of work obligations;
e) Grant temporary relief pendente lite to restrict overnight parenting time when Mr. Johnson is scheduled to work night shifts and to implement notice requirements while the matter is pending; and
f) Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the best interests of Emma and Noah.

9.1 Petitioner certifies, to the best of her knowledge and belief, that the allegations contained in this Complaint are true and correct.

Notes and Practical Considerations (for Petitioner)
- Attach a copy of the Existing Order (May 15, 2020) to this Complaint as an exhibit.
- Attach any relevant evidence you have (text messages, emails, calendars showing Mr. Johnson’s work schedule, notes of incidents, and any statements by the children) as exhibits supporting the factual allegations and need for modification.
- Consider requesting a pendente lite hearing for temporary relief while this petition is decided.
- Because the Court may require more precise statutory and caselaw citations at hearing, you should, if possible, consult with counsel or a family law clinic before the hearing.
