COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 45 Washington Avenue, Apartment __, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, and at all times relevant was Plaintiff's landlord.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Chelsea District Court under Massachusetts law because the premises are located in Chelsea and the cause of action arises from the landlord-tenant relationship concerning the rented premises (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process jurisdiction and remedies)).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. Plaintiff began renting the apartment at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, MA on or about May 1, 2022, under a tenancy for which Plaintiff pays rent of $1,250.00 per month.

5. At all relevant times, Defendant was the landlord and had control and responsibility for the maintenance and security of the common areas of the building, including the main entry door and locks to the building.

6. For at least two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the main entry door to the building has had a broken lock that does not latch properly and which allows the door to be pushed open easily by unauthorized persons.

7. Plaintiff notified Defendant verbally of the broken main entry door lock approximately two months ago and requested repair. Defendant replied that he would fix the lock, but he has not done so.

8. Plaintiff followed up with Defendant on at least two further occasions, reminding him of the unrepaired broken lock, but Defendant has failed to perform any repair or to otherwise reasonably secure the building entry.

9. In or about November 2025, an unknown person(s) entered the building and went through mail and packages left in the hallway. Several residents, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the common hallway. Plaintiff lost a package of personal property valued at approximately $120.00.

10. In the months preceding this Complaint, Plaintiff has also discovered evidence that someone has been sleeping in the basement of the building, indicating unauthorized and unpermitted access to building common areas.

11. The ongoing failure to secure the main entry door, and Defendant's failure to timely repair or otherwise secure the building, has materially interfered with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the leased premises, created a risk to Plaintiff's person and property, and caused Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses for self-help security measures.

12. To protect herself and her personal property in light of Defendant's failure to secure the building, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for her apartment door and purchased and installed a better deadbolt for her apartment door, at a combined cost of approximately $200.00.

13. Defendant has asserted to Plaintiff that she is "overreacting" and that the neighborhood is safe, but Defendant has failed to take reasonable steps to secure the building or to warn tenants about the actual security problems, despite notice.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's failure to maintain adequate security and to repair the broken main entry lock after notice, Plaintiff has suffered actual damage in the form of personal property loss ($120.00) and reasonable security expenditures ($200.00), for total actual damages of approximately $320.00, and has suffered emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of the premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Common Law; Massachusetts)

15. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes a tenant the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. That covenant is breached when the landlord's acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises, including failure to take reasonable steps to secure common areas and protect tenants from foreseeable intrusions by third parties. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 5.1 (covenant of quiet enjoyment); 105 CMR 410.000 (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code provisions and minimum standards applicable to residential premises, bearing on landlord obligations to maintain premises in fit and habitable condition).

17. Defendant had notice of the broken main entry door lock and had the obligation to maintain the building's common areas in a reasonably safe condition for tenants, or to take reasonable remedial measures after having been made aware of the defective lock.

18. Defendant's failure, after notice, to repair the defective lock, to secure the building entry, or to warn tenants of the ongoing security risk from the defective main entry door constituted a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment and use of the premises.

19. Defendant's omission foreseeably allowed unauthorized persons to gain access to the building common areas, resulting in theft of packages from the hallway and evidence of unauthorized persons sleeping in the basement, which have increased the risk of harm to tenants and their property and have caused Plaintiff to incur expenses to protect herself.

20. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in the approximate amount of $320.00 in out-of-pocket losses and expenditures, plus consequential damages for emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment, together with costs and interest.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hartman respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Michael Thompson as follows:

A. For general and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including actual out-of-pocket damages in the amount of $320.00 for a stolen package and security expenditures for which Defendant is responsible;

B. For consequential damages for loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and other harms proximately caused by Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in an amount to be determined at trial;

C. For costs of suit and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Jessica Hartman
