COMPLAINT (Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)
Plaintiff, Emily Thompson (pro se), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson is an individual and tenant residing at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA 02150.
2. Defendant John Ramirez is the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA 02150.
3. Plaintiff began renting the subject apartment on or about January 15, 2022, and pays rent of $1,500.00 per month to Defendant.
4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Chelsea District Court. Venue is proper in this Court because the subject premises are located in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Plaintiff restates and incorporates paragraphs 1–4 as if fully set forth herein.
6. For at least two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the main entry door to the building at 45 Broadway St has had a broken latch/lock and will not properly latch, so that the door can be pushed open by unauthorized persons.
7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the broken lock approximately two months ago and requested repair. Defendant acknowledged the report and said he would fix the door, but no repair or security improvement has been made.
8. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the needed repair on at least two subsequent occasions, but Defendant failed to arrange for repair or to otherwise secure the building entry.
9. Last month, unauthorized person(s) entered the building and went through mail left in the hallway. Several residents had packages stolen. Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately $120.00, was taken.
10. Plaintiff has observed or found evidence that someone has been sleeping in the building basement, which has made Plaintiff feel unsafe in and about the premises.
11. As a result of Defendant’s failure to repair or secure the common entry, Plaintiff reasonably feared for her safety and took steps to protect herself and her property. Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera at her apartment door and purchased a better deadbolt for her apartment door at a total out-of-pocket cost of approximately $200.00.
12. Defendant has minimized Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that Plaintiff is “overreacting” and that the neighborhood is safe, but Defendant has taken no corrective steps to secure the building entry or to warn residents about reported trespassers.
13. Defendant’s failure to repair and maintain the common entrance, and his failure to take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized entry and theft, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and has caused Plaintiff economic loss and emotional distress.

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts common law)
14. Plaintiff restates and incorporates paragraphs 1–13 as if fully set forth herein.
15. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord owes to the tenant an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment — i.e., the tenant is entitled to possession and use of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or third parties whose interference the landlord intentionally or negligently permits. A landlord is obligated to take reasonable steps to protect tenants from foreseeable intrusions on their enjoyment and use of the premises.
16. Defendant’s repeated failure and refusal to timely repair the building’s main entry lock and to otherwise secure the premises, after being notified of the defective locking mechanism, constituted a negligent and/or willful failure to take reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable intrusions and thefts by third parties.
17. Defendant’s conduct substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s lawful use and enjoyment of the rented apartment by exposing Plaintiff and other residents to unauthorized entry, theft, and the reasonable apprehension that individuals were living/sleeping in building common areas.
18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including:
    a. Loss of personal property (a stolen package) in the amount of approximately $120.00;
    b. Out-of-pocket expenses for the purchase and installation of a security camera and a better deadbolt, in the amount of approximately $200.00;
    c. Emotional harm, inconvenience, and loss of the full use and enjoyment of the premises.
19. Plaintiff estimates total compensatory damages in the amount of $320.00 (package loss + security expenditure) and reserves the right to amend and supplement this amount for additional provable damages, including emotional distress and any additional losses discovered.

APPLICABLE LAW (representative authorities)
20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is recognized in Massachusetts common law and is applied to residential landlord-tenant relationships; landlord obligations and tenants’ remedies are governed by the Landlord and Tenant laws of Massachusetts (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186) and related Massachusetts authority. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (summary process). Plaintiff asserts her claim under the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as applied under Massachusetts law.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:
A. Judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages in the amount of $320.00 (or such other sum as the Court finds proper at trial) for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
B. An order directing Defendant to repair and maintain the main entry lock/latch and to take reasonable measures to secure the building common areas to prevent unauthorized entry and to protect tenants’ property and safety;
C. Costs of suit and pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent allowed by law;
D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Notes and important client information (please read)
- I have drafted this complaint to present your single claim of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, based on the facts you provided. I have included a reference to the controlling Massachusetts statutory chapter (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186) and chapter related to summary process (ch. 239) as general statutory authorities governing landlord-tenant matters in Massachusetts.
- I have not added additional causes of action (for example, conversion, negligence, breach of warranty of habitability, or M.G.L. c. 93A), as you specifically requested only a covenant of quiet enjoyment claim.
- I have not listed multiple Massachusetts cases by name because I cannot be certain of specific case citations without risking error. If you wish, you can ask a lawyer to supplement the complaint with SJC and Appeals Court authorities interpreting and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment in Massachusetts; a lawyer can also add precise statutory section citations and on-point case law tailored to your facts and preferred remedies.
- Before filing, please:
    1. Review and, if needed, complete the Certificate of Service method of service and the docket number and any local court filing requirements;
    2. Confirm the Defendant’s correct mailing/service address for proper service;
    3. Consider seeking free or low-cost legal assistance to review the complaint and advise on service, filing fees, and any additional claims or remedies you may have (e.g., reporting stolen goods to the police, seeking help from a tenant-hotline, or pursuing additional damages).
- If you want, I can produce a revised complaint that includes suggested Massachusetts case authority and more detailed statutory citations; to avoid providing inaccurate legal citations I would identify the specific authorities here and note that they should be verified by counsel or court clerks before filing.
