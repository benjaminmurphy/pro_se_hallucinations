Brockton Community Center,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Ethan Johnson, and for his Complaint against the Defendant Brockton Community Center alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Ethan Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s address for service is c/o 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts (the location of the incident). Plaintiff may be reached by telephone at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) is an entity that operates an after-school program and community recreational facilities located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, within Bristol County. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, maintained, managed, supervised, controlled, and/or had responsibility for the premises and programs at that location.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Bristol County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Bristol County and the Defendant conducts business in Bristol County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son (“the Child”) was attending an after-school program run by Defendant at the Community Center located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

5. Defendant advertises and represents that children attending its after-school programs will be supervised at all times while on its premises, including in the gymnasium. Defendant held itself out to the public as providing adequate supervision and safe programming for children.

6. On the date in question, the program in the gymnasium was supposed to be staffed by two employees supervising approximately twenty children. One employee left the gym to perform paperwork in the office, leaving only a single staff member physically present in the gymnasium.

7. The remaining staff member was primarily looking at her phone while seated near the bleachers and was not actively supervising the children on the gym floor. Two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began engaging in a rough “tackle” style game on the hardwood gym floor.

8. Several children reported the rough conduct to the staff member. The staff member responded dismissively, stating “boys will be boys,” and took no meaningful action to stop the dangerous activity or separate the children to prevent injury.

9. As a direct and proximate result of the staff member’s inadequate supervision and failure to intervene, one of the older boys tackled the Child with force, causing the Child to strike his head against the hardwood floor. The Child lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds and sustained a concussion.

10. The Child required treatment in the emergency room for the head injury and concussion. Plaintiff incurred approximately $4,500.00 in medical expenses in connection with the Child’s treatment. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200.00 in wages due to time spent obtaining emergency and follow-up care for his Child and attending to medical needs.

11. The Child missed several days of school as a direct result of the concussion. The Child and the Plaintiff continue to experience effects and harms associated with the injury, including pain, suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and out-of-pocket expenses.

12. At all material times, Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in operating, supervising, maintaining, and staffing its after-school program to protect children from foreseeable injury, to provide adequate supervision by properly trained and attentive staff, and to eliminate or control known hazards or dangerous activities in the gymnasium.

13. Defendant breached its duties by, among other things:
    a. Failing to provide adequate staff supervision in light of the number and ages of the children present;
    b. Allowing a single, inattentive employee to supervise approximately twenty children engaged in physical activity;
    c. Failing to reasonably supervise and control the behavior of older children engaged in rough, tackle-style play in close proximity to smaller children;
    d. Failing to enforce reasonable rules prohibiting dangerous rough play on the hardwood floor;
    e. Failing to respond reasonably to reports from children that rough play was occurring;
    f. Failing to provide a safe environment for invitees, including children attending the after-school program; and
    g. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence and breaches of duty, the Child suffered a concussion and loss of consciousness, incurred medical expenses, required emergency and follow-up medical care, missed school, and Plaintiff suffered economic losses, all as described above. Plaintiff and the Child have also suffered non-economic damages, including pain, suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of the Child’s enjoyment of life.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff’s Child and to Plaintiff to exercise reasonable care in the supervision and operation of its after-school program and its premises.

17. Defendant breached that duty by failing to provide adequate supervision, permitting dangerous conduct, and otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care as described above.

18. Defendant’s breach was a direct and proximate cause of the Child’s injuries and Plaintiff’s losses.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages including, but not limited to:
    a. Past and future medical expenses (approximately $4,500.00 incurred to date and continuing expenses as required);
    b. Past lost wages (approximately $1,200.00) and future lost income and/or earning capacity as may be proven at trial;
    c. Past and future pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;
    d. Other incidental and consequential damages, costs, and expenses, including court costs and interest.

APPLICABLE LAW (SELECTED AUTHORITIES)

To support the legal theories pleaded in this Complaint, Plaintiff relies upon established principles of negligence and premises liability under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to:

Statutes
- M.G.L. c. 260, §2A (statute of limitations for actions for injury to the person — generally three years from the date of injury);
- M.G.L. c. 258 (Massachusetts Tort Claims Act — applicable to claims against municipalities and public employees; notice requirements where applicable);
- M.G.L. c. 231 and other applicable statutes governing civil actions and remedies in Massachusetts;

- Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (duty of possessor of land to invitees to keep premises reasonably safe);

Massachusetts Case Law (Representative)
- Massachusetts decisions recognizing duties of care and standards for negligence and premises liability; see, e.g.,
    - Massachusetts cases addressing duty and breach in the context of premises liability and supervision of invitees and children;
    - Massachusetts cases addressing foreseeability and proximate cause in negligence claims;
    - Massachusetts authorities interpreting the duty to supervise minors and the responsibility of custodians/operators of recreational programs for children.

(Notes: Plaintiff intends to rely upon controlling Massachusetts statutes, SJC and Appeals Court decisions, and authoritative secondary sources (including the Restatement (Second) of Torts) in support of the elements of negligence (duty, breach, causation, damages) at trial and in support of any motion practice. Plaintiff will cite and rely upon specific controlling Massachusetts case law and statutory authority in briefing and at trial as necessary.)
