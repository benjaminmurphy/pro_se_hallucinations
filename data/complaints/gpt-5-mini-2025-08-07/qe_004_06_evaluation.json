As a leading New York Court of Appeals decision on these issues, it is strong persuasive authority on landlord duties and tenant remedies even outside New York.",

The obligation of the tenant to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord\u2019s satisfactory maintenance of the premises in habitable condition\u2026 the proper measure of damages for breach of the warranty is the difference between the fair market value of the premises if they had been as warranted\u2026 and the value of the premises during the period of the breach.\u201d"
