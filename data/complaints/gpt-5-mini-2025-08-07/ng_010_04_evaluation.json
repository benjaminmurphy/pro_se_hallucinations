Cardozo\u2019s analysis focuses on the relational nature of negligence and the need for reasonably foreseeable risk to the plaintiff, which fits the proposition that Palsgraf is a leading case on foreseeability and proximate cause in negligence and premises-type situations.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension\u2026 Negligence, like risk, is thus a term of relation. Negligence in the abstract, apart from things related, is surely not a tort\u2026 If the harm was not willful, he must show that the act as to him had possibilities of danger so many and apparent as to entitle him to be protected\u2026 The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us.\u201d"
