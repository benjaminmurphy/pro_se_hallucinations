      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges Defendant operated an after\u2011school program for children, advertised that children would be supervised, and explicitly pleads a duty to supervise, provide safe premises/activities, properly staff the program, and prevent foreseeable harm (\u00b6\u00b62.1\u20132.2, 3.2)."

    "breach": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint pleads concrete facts showing breaches: understaffing (two assigned, one left), leaving one staff to supervise ~20 children, inattentive staff on a cell phone, dismissal of reports of dangerous play, and failure to intervene or train (\u00b6\u00b62.3\u20132.7; 3.3(a)\u2013(e))."

      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Plaintiff alleges the son was tackled and struck his head as a direct result of the lack of adequate supervision and failure to intervene, and that those omissions caused his concussion and treatment (\u00b6\u00b62.8\u20132.10, 3.4\u20133.5). Those factual allegations support the plausible but\u2011for link that, but for the inadequate supervision and non\u2011intervention, the tackle and resulting injury would not have occurred."

      "satisfied": true,
