Parham v. J.R. addresses federal due process requirements for the voluntary commitment of minors to state mental institutions and discusses parental rights and state interests in that context.

Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is \u2018the mere creature of the State\u2019 ... Nonetheless, we have recognized that a state is not without constitutional control over parental discretion in dealing with children when their physical or mental health is jeopardized.\" (Parham v.

Thus it cannot serve as authority for the Massachusetts custody-modification standard described in the proposition.",

Second, he claims error in the exclusion of the probable cause transcript disclosing the cross-examination of the two victims by counsel for the co-defendant Stiles."
