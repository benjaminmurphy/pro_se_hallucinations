MICHAEL TURNER,
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1.   Parties, Residence, and Jurisdiction
     a. Petitioner: Jessica Turner, residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
     b. Respondent: Michael Turner, residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.
     c. Child: Emily Turner, born 2013 (age 12).
     d. This Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Massachusetts statutes governing child custody and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, et seq., and related provisions governing modification of custody orders.

2.   Existing Order
     a. On May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody/parenting time order providing for joint physical custody of the minor child, Emily Turner, on a one-week-on/one-week-off alternating residential schedule (the “2018 Order”).
     b. The 2018 Order remains in effect and is the custody order that Petitioner seeks to modify.

3.   Basis for Relief — Material Change in Circumstances
     a. Petitioner alleges that since entry of the 2018 Order there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare, safety, and best interests of the minor child, sufficient to warrant modification of the 2018 Order.
     b. Specifically, Respondent Michael Turner has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition since entry of the 2018 Order. The condition has materially worsened within the past 12–24 months.
     c. As a result of his condition, Respondent has experienced multiple falls at home. Respondent’s treating physician has advised that Respondent should not be left alone with the minor child in situations that involve stairs or that may require a quick physical response for safety reasons.
     d. Despite these medical warnings and the declines in Respondent’s mobility and balance, Respondent continues to insist on maintaining the exact same one-week-on/one-week-off residential schedule set forth in the 2018 Order.
     e. Petitioner has observed Respondent relying on the minor child—age 12—to assist Respondent with transfers (including helping Respondent move from a wheelchair to a bed) and to bring Respondent items from other rooms in the house. Petitioner believes and alleges this reliance places an undue caregiving burden on the child and creates a safety risk to the child and Respondent.
     f. The foregoing changes in Respondent’s physical condition, functional capacity, medical restrictions, and caregiving conduct constitute a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Order which directly impact the minor child’s safety, welfare, and best interests.

4.   Best Interests of the Child
     a. Under Massachusetts law, child custody determinations and modifications must be guided by the best interests of the child. The factors the Court may consider include, but are not limited to, the child’s safety, the child’s physical and emotional needs, each parent’s capacity to meet those needs, the child’s established patterns and routines, the nature of parental cooperation, and any other factor relevant to the child’s welfare.
     b. Petitioner alleges that modification of the 2018 Order to provide that primary physical custody be vested with Petitioner, with a revised parenting time schedule for Respondent tailored to Respondent’s current physical limitations and safety needs, is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Turner.
     c. Petitioner further alleges that continued strict adherence to the alternating week physical custody schedule creates a real and present risk to the child’s safety and emotional well-being because of Respondent’s falls, limited mobility, reliance on the child for physical assistance, and physician advice that Respondent should not be alone with the child in certain circumstances.

5.   Relief Requested — Specific Modification Sought
     Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the 2018 Order as follows:
     a. Award primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Turner, to Petitioner, Jessica Turner, with the child’s primary residence to be with Petitioner.
     b. Grant Respondent reasonable parenting time consistent with Respondent’s health, safety considerations, and the minor child’s best interests. As an initial structure, Petitioner requests that the Court consider:
         i. Court-approved supervised or supported parenting time for Respondent for a reasonable initial period (for example, visits at Respondent’s home with a qualified caregiver present, or visits at a neutral supervised-visitation facility), and/or
         ii. A graduated parenting-time plan that begins with shorter daytime visits in Respondent’s presence while a designated adult caregiver or supervisor is present, with incremental increases as Respondent’s condition and demonstrated safe parenting capacity permit, and
         iii. A specific prohibition on Respondent being alone with the minor child in circumstances involving stairs or where a quick physical response may be required unless and until Respondent provides medical evidence and a safety plan acceptable to the Court demonstrating Respondent can safely be unsupervised with the child.
     c. Require that Respondent provide current medical records and a written functional capacity assessment from Respondent’s treating physician(s) regarding Respondent’s diagnosis, prognosis, limitations, recommended safety accommodations, and fitness to parent unsupervised.
     d. Permit either party to seek further modification or restoration of parenting time upon a showing of changed circumstances, medical improvement, or other relevant information.
     e. Any other relief that the Court deems just and proper to protect the minor child’s safety and best interests, including allocation of transportation responsibilities, exchange locations, and procedures to resolve disputes.

6.   Legal Basis
     a. Petitioner seeks modification under the statutory and common-law standards applicable in Massachusetts, including, without limitation, the provisions governing custody and modifications, and the UCCJEA for jurisdictional matters.
     b. Petitioner alleges that there exists a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Order that affects the welfare of the minor child and justifies modification in accordance with the best-interests standard as applied by Massachusetts courts.
     c. Petitioner intends to rely on applicable Massachusetts statutory and case law jurisprudence regarding modification of custody orders, the best-interests standard, and the Court’s authority to tailor parenting time to protect the child’s welfare.

     (Petitioner will rely on the statutes and case law governing custody and modification in Massachusetts, including but not limited to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (UCCJEA) and relevant Massachusetts decisions interpreting the modification standard and the best-interests factors. Petitioner respectfully requests the Court to consider controlling statutory provisions and authoritative case law in deciding this Petition.)

Notes and Guidance (for Petitioner’s use in filing and court proceedings)
- Before filing, you must fill in the Docket No. (if known), include your current street address (or follow local rules for in-camera address disclosure), and select the proper method of service in the Certificate of Service.
- If you desire that the Court consider supervised visitation, you may need to propose a qualified supervisor or supervised-visitation provider and indicate ability to pay or request the Court to order supervision arrangements.
- Attach copies of the 2018 custody order and any available medical documentation from Respondent’s treating physician documenting the diagnosis, recommendations, and any restrictions.
- Consider attaching a short affidavit describing specific incidents (dates and brief descriptions of falls, examples when the child assisted Respondent with transfers, and physician advice) so the Court has concrete factual support for the material-change allegation.
- The Probate and Family Court may require additional forms (cover sheet, scheduling order form, UCCJEA affidavit about the child’s residence, financial statements if custody disputes involve support issues, etc.). Check the Berkshire Probate and Family Court local rules and website for required forms and filing procedures.
- If you want the Court to enter emergency relief (temporary custody modification or emergency orders restricting unsupervised contact), you may file a motion for temporary orders supported by an affidavit showing imminent risk to the child’s safety.

If you would like, I can:
- Produce a model affidavit of facts for filing with this Complaint (including suggested language for incidents and proposed safety accommodations);
- Draft a proposed temporary order for the Court’s consideration;
- List sample supervised-visitation providers or language for a graduated parenting-time plan you can propose to the Court (you will need to confirm local providers and availability).
