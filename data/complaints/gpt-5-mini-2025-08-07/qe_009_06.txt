COMPLAINT
(Claim: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

1. Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1.1 Plaintiff Jasmine Reed ("Plaintiff" or "Reed") is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment __, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1433@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Thomas Blackwood ("Defendant" or "Landlord") is the landlord and owner (or agent of the owner) of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Apartment __, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103, where Plaintiff resides.
1.3 Plaintiff and Defendant are subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Massachusetts law and venue is proper in Springfield District Court because the rental premises and events giving rise to this complaint are located in Springfield.
1.4 Plaintiff entered into possession of the premises on or about June 1, 2022, and pays monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant.

2. Statement of Claim
2.1 This is an action for damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in leases under Massachusetts law and related authorities. Plaintiff seeks damages for loss of use of a portion of the leased premises and related out-of-pocket expenses incurred because of Defendant’s failure to timely and adequately repair electrical wiring serving one bedroom of Plaintiff’s apartment.

3. Factual Allegations
3.1 Plaintiff is a tenant of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, having begun tenancy on or about June 1, 2022, and paying monthly rent of $1,200.
3.2 Beginning on or about October 20, 2025 (approximately six weeks before the date of this Complaint), one of the two bedrooms in Plaintiff’s apartment lost electrical power. The outlets in that bedroom do not work and the overhead light does not function. The remainder of the apartment retains electrical service.
3.3 Plaintiff notified Defendant of the loss of electricity in that bedroom. Defendant arranged for an electrician to inspect the problem. The electrician informed Defendant that the problem could not be resolved by a simple repair and that the wiring to that bedroom required a more extensive repair.
3.4 Defendant has represented to Plaintiff that Defendant is obtaining quotes for repair and that repair is “complicated” because of the age of the building and its wiring. Despite those representations, Defendant has not arranged for, commenced, or completed a permanent and adequate repair as of the date of this Complaint.
3.5 Because the bedroom has had no electricity for approximately six weeks, Plaintiff has been unable to use that bedroom for its intended purpose. Plaintiff used the bedroom primarily as a home office. The loss of a functional home office has forced Plaintiff to leave the premises to work.
3.6 As a direct consequence of Defendant’s failure to restore service or otherwise provide suitable alternative arrangements, Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses, including (a) daily expenditures of approximately $15.00 for coffee and food while working at coffee shops and other off-site locations, and (b) a coworking-space membership costing approximately $150.00 per month because Plaintiff needs a reliable workspace. Plaintiff has been forced to crowd remaining personal and office items into the living room, substantially interfering with her quiet and reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment as a residence.
3.7 Plaintiff has been in regular contact with Defendant about the problem, has requested repair, and has attempted to cooperate in good faith. Defendant has not provided a reasonable timetable for repair and has not remedied the interference with Plaintiff’s use of the premises.
3.8 As a proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair the wiring and restore electricity to the affected bedroom, Plaintiff has suffered damages including but not limited to: lost use of the bedroom, costs of alternative workspace and daily subsistence while working off-site, diminution of the habitability and quiet enjoyment of the apartment, emotional distress and inconvenience, and other consequential damages. Plaintiff calculates the damages at approximately $900.00 as of the date of filing this Complaint (detailed below).

4. Calculation of Damages (as alleged)
4.1 Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the amount of $900.00 for loss of use of the bedroom, costs of alternative workspace (coworking membership), and daily expenses incurred as a direct consequence of Defendant’s breach. Plaintiff reserves the right to prove more precise and additional damages at trial, including pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs, and any other appropriate relief.

5. Cause of Action — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Common Law / Massachusetts Law)
5.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 4 above as if fully set forth herein.
5.2 Under Massachusetts law, an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is included in residential tenancies: a tenant is entitled to possession and the peaceful, use and enjoyment of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186; Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant § 12.1 (1977); Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing an implied warranty/covenant of habitability and related quiet enjoyment doctrine as applied in many jurisdictions); see also Gurliacci v. Mayer, 424 Mass. 157 (1997) (discussing tenant remedies for landlord breaches affecting habitability and enjoyment).
5.3 A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of material portions of the leased premises, including failure to repair critical systems such as electrical wiring when the landlord is responsible for repair. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970); Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 4.1, 12.1; see also Massachusetts authorities recognizing the tenant’s right to habitable conditions and remedies for substantial interference (collecting authorities).
5.4 The Commonwealth’s housing and sanitary laws and regulations also recognize obligations related to habitability and safety. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111; 105 CMR 410.000 (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (landlord-tenant provisions).
5.5 Decisions of the Massachusetts courts and courts in other jurisdictions have long held that substantial interference with use of an essential portion of the leased premises entitles the tenant to damages and, in some circumstances, other relief. See, e.g., Gurliacci v. Mayer, 424 Mass. 157 (1997); Carvalho v. Paul, 365 Mass. 221 (1974) (discussing landlord obligations); Sheehan v. The Travelers Ins. Co., 381 Mass. 306 (1980) (noting remedial principles); Javins, supra; Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984); Brown v. Southall Realty, 295 N.Y. 554 (1946) (rent abatement doctrine); see also Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 7.4, 12.1; 2A Powell on Real Property ¶ 32.04 (discussing quiet enjoyment and remedies).
5.6 Defendant’s failure to repair or to provide timely, adequate remediation for the electrical failure in the bedroom, despite notice and opportunity to act, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s beneficial use of the leased premises and breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the lease.
5.7 As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has sustained damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including the presently-estimated sum of $900.00, together with costs and interest.

6. Authorities (representative, non-exhaustive)
Plaintiff relies on and gives notice of the following authorities pertinent to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord duties, habitability and tenant remedies under Massachusetts law and persuasive authorities:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (general landlord-tenant provisions), including § 14 (implied covenants and tenant remedies).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and 105 CMR 410.000 (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 4.1, 7.4, 12.1 (1977).
- Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (seminal case recognizing warranty of habitability and related tenant remedies).
- Gurliacci v. Mayer, 424 Mass. 157 (1997) (Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision discussing tenant remedies).
- Carvalho v. Paul, 365 Mass. 221 (1974).
- Sheehan v. Travelers Ins. Co., 381 Mass. 306 (1980).
- Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (persuasive authority on implied warranties/quiet enjoyment).
- Brown v. Southall Realty, 295 N.Y. 554 (1946) (rent abatement doctrine and tenant remedies).
- Selected treatises: 2A Powell on Real Property ¶ 32.04; 2A Am. Jur. 2d Landlord & Tenant § 61 (discussing covenant of quiet enjoyment).

( Plaintiff intends to rely on these authorities and other Massachusetts and persuasive authorities as may be appropriate and developed in discovery and at trial.)

7. Demand for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:
a. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of at least $900.00 (or in an amount proven at trial) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
b. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
c. Award costs of suit and reasonable costs and fees allowable by law; and
d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including an order directing Defendant to commence and complete necessary repairs in a reasonably prompt manner so as to restore Plaintiff’s full use and enjoyment of the premises.

8. Jury Demand
Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
