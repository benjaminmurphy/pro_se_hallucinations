Mark Johnson
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Rachel") is and has been a resident of Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant Mark Johnson ("Defendant" or "Mark") is the other parent of the minor child and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court's jurisdiction over custody and modification proceedings.

2. Child
2.1. This action concerns the custody and parenting time of the minor child:
     - Samantha Johnson, born in 2015 (age 10).

3. Prior Order
3.1. On May 15, 2022, this Court entered a custody/parenting order (the "Existing Order") that established joint legal custody of Samantha, designated Rachel as the primary residential parent, and awarded Defendant substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights that extend into Sunday nights.
3.2. The Existing Order included an express requirement that the parties cooperate on school matters and keep one another informed of important decisions and school-related issues concerning Samantha.

4. Nature of Proceeding
4.1. Plaintiff brings this Complaint for Modification of Custody/Parenting Time pursuant to the Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting time when there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and when modification is in the child's best interests.

5. Facts and Allegations (Establishing Material Change in Circumstances)
5.1. At the time the Existing Order was entered in May 2022, Samantha was attending school regularly and performing satisfactorily academically. The parties cooperated with school matters as ordered.
5.2. Over the past year (2024–2025), Defendant has repeatedly kept Samantha home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time. Defendant has characterized these absences as "mental health days."
5.3. The Monday absences have occurred frequently and without prior written notice to Plaintiff, contrary to the Existing Order’s requirement that the parties inform and cooperate with one another on school matters.
5.4. Defendant has not provided medical documentation, physicians' notes, school nurse notes, or any other verifiable evidence that Samantha has a medical, psychiatric, or other condition justifying frequent excused absences from school on Mondays after Defendant’s parenting time.
5.5. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested information and documentation from Defendant regarding the absences, which Defendant has failed to produce.
5.6. As a direct result of the increased absences, the school has issued truancy warnings to the family and has notified Plaintiff that Samantha’s unexplained absences jeopardize her attendance record and may result in school-based interventions.
5.7. Samantha’s academic performance has declined over the relevant period: grades and standardized test scores have dropped since May 2022, and teachers have reported increased missed instruction time on Mondays as contributing to gaps in Samantha’s learning.
5.8. Defendant has regularly refused to take Samantha to scheduled tutoring sessions that occur during his weekends, causing Samantha to miss supplemental academic support that she requires to improve her grades and test performance.
5.9. Plaintiff believes, and therefore avers, that Defendant’s unilateral practice of keeping Samantha home frequently on school days and his refusal to support tutoring during his parenting time are undermining Samantha’s educational progress and welfare.
5.10. Defendant’s conduct in failing to cooperate on school matters and failing to inform Plaintiff (as required by the Existing Order) has materially changed the circumstances affecting Samantha’s welfare since entry of the Existing Order.

6. Legal Standard
6.1. Under Massachusetts law, an existing custody or parenting time order may be modified when the moving party demonstrates a material change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare since the entry of the order, and when the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. Plaintiff alleges such a material change in circumstances and that the proposed modifications are in Samantha’s best interests.
6.2. Plaintiff further alleges that the Court has authority to issue temporary relief and to allocate decision-making authority on particular topics (such as school attendance and educational decisions) where there is a demonstrated need to resolve an urgent dispute affecting the child’s welfare.

7. Claims for Relief
COUNT I — Modification of Parenting Time and Allocation of Decision-Making Authority Regarding School Attendance and Educational Decisions
7.1. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 6 above.
7.2. Plaintiff alleges a material change in circumstances since May 15, 2022: specifically, Defendant’s repeated, unexplained removal of Samantha from school on Mondays after his parenting time, his refusal to transport Samantha to scheduled tutoring during his weekends, his failure to produce medical documentation to justify frequent absences, and his failure to cooperate and keep Plaintiff informed about school matters.
7.3. The material change adversely affects Samantha’s welfare (attendance, educational progress, and academic performance).
7.4. Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court:
     a. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the Existing Order and that modification is warranted;
     b. Modify the Existing Order to allocate final decision-making authority on educational matters, including school attendance, tutoring, and other academic supports, to Plaintiff (Rachel Thompson), or, in the alternative, order that decisions concerning school attendance require advance written notice to and written agreement of both parents or, failing agreement, be made by the Court after expedited hearing;
     c. As an alternative and/or interim measure, modify Defendant’s parenting time so that his overnight parenting time does not include Sunday nights on school nights (i.e., eliminate or curtail parenting time that extends into Sunday nights during the school year), or otherwise restructure parenting time to prevent loss of school on Mondays;
     d. Order that Defendant must provide advance written notice to Plaintiff of any school absence, the reason for the absence, and any supporting documentation (doctor’s notes, therapist notes, or other verification) reasonably promptly (within 24 hours) when an absence occurs; and
     e. Require Defendant to cooperate with efforts to obtain any necessary medical or mental health evaluations and to authorize and attend meetings with school personnel or tutors as reasonably requested by Plaintiff to address Samantha’s educational needs.

COUNT II — Temporary Relief and Notice/Information
7.5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 6 above.
7.6. Because Samantha’s school attendance and academic progress are ongoing and time-sensitive concerns, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an interim/temporary order:
     a. Preventing Defendant from unilaterally keeping Samantha home from school on Mondays following his parenting time without prior written consent from Plaintiff or a documented medical excuse;
     b. Requiring Defendant to produce, within 10 days of service of this Complaint, copies of any medical, mental health, or school-related documentation he claims supports absences he has caused;
     c. Ordering that Defendant must make reasonable efforts to get Samantha to any scheduled tutoring sessions that occur during his parenting time or, if unavailable, to reschedule tutoring at mutually agreeable times so Samantha does not miss tutoring sessions; and
     d. Ordering expedited disclosure and production of communications between Defendant and any third parties (providers, school personnel) relating to Samantha’s absences.

COUNT III — Contempt / Enforcement (Reservation)
7.7. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 6 above.
7.8. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek contempt sanctions or other enforcement for Defendant’s failure to comply with the Existing Order’s cooperation and notice provisions should the Court find Defendant has willfully violated any enforceable term of the Existing Order.

8. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment as follows:
8.1. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order on May 15, 2022;
8.2. Modify the Existing Order to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority over school attendance and educational decisions for Samantha, or enter an order requiring both parents’ advance written agreement on school attendance or immediate court resolution in the event of dispute;
8.3. Alternatively, reduce or eliminate Defendant’s parenting time that extends into Sunday nights on school nights during the academic year (or otherwise restructure parenting time to avoid Monday school absences);
8.4. Enter temporary/expedited relief as set forth in Paragraph 7.6 above pending final hearing on this Complaint;
8.5. Order Defendant to produce within 10 days any and all documentation supporting the absences from school he has authorized or caused (medical notes, therapist notes, school communications, etc.);
8.6. Require both parties to cooperate with the school and any educational or mental health professionals for the purpose of creating and implementing a plan to restore Samantha’s regular school attendance and academic progress (including reasonable accommodations, tutoring, or evaluation as recommended);
8.7. Award Plaintiff costs of this action and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including, if warranted, attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this modification action;
8.8. Grant any other relief the Court finds necessary to protect Samantha’s welfare and best interests.

9. Request for Hearing; Request for Temporary Order; Request for Service
9.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule an expedited hearing on this Complaint and consider plaintiff’s request for a temporary order as outlined above.
9.2. Plaintiff requests that the Court order service of process upon Defendant by any method permitted under Massachusetts law and the Probate and Family Court Rules.

10. Verification and Pro Se Representation
10.1. Plaintiff is proceeding pro se. Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the factual allegations set forth in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of her knowledge, information, and belief.

AUTHORITIES (GENERAL)
The plaintiff intends to rely upon Massachusetts law regarding modification of custody and parenting time based on a material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child, and in particular statutory and decisional law governing:
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 76 (compulsory school attendance and related provisions);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 51A (mandated reporting of abuse/neglect) and other provisions regarding child welfare and protection;
- Massachusetts statutes and Probate & Family Court authority relating to custody, parenting time, and modification of existing orders;
- Massachusetts cases and SJC decisions interpreting the "material change in circumstances" standard and the "best interests of the child" standard as applied to modifications of custody and allocation of parental decision-making on educational issues;
- Probate & Family Court local rules and standing orders regarding emergency/temporary orders and expedited hearings in matters affecting child welfare.

(Actual statutory sections, local rules, and controlling SJC and Appeals Court decisions will be cited in court filings and at hearing with the assistance of counsel or upon review of authoritative sources. Plaintiff requests the Court's guidance on any required form of citation for expedited consideration.)

Notes and Practical Points (for the Court’s convenience)
- Plaintiff can provide school records, truancy warnings, teacher statements, and copies of missed tutoring appointments at or before the hearing to substantiate the allegation that the absences are frequent, unexplained, and damaging Samantha’s education.
- Plaintiff requests permission to obtain an expedited educational assessment and to present the results to the Court.
- Plaintiff requests the Court consider a narrowly tailored interim restriction on Sunday-night overnights during the school year to prevent further Monday absences while the matter is litigated.

If the Court prefers more specific statutory and case citations in the complaint itself, Plaintiff will promptly file an amended complaint or memorandum of law supplying the precise citations and attachments at the Court’s direction.
