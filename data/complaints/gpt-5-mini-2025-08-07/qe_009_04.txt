COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Greene ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Greene is a natural person and a resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1433@gmail.com. Plaintiff resides at 456 Maple Street, Apartment [Unit No. if any], Springfield, Massachusetts (the "Premises").

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner/landlord of the Premises and may be served at 456 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (or at such other address as Defendant may be found). Defendant is the landlord for the Premises rented by Plaintiff.

3. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises effective January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00.

4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under Massachusetts law and venue is proper in Springfield District Court because the Premises are located in Springfield, Massachusetts and the acts complained of occurred in this judicial district.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff is a tenant of the Premises pursuant to a tenancy that began on January 15, 2022, for which Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

6. Beginning approximately in mid-October 2025 and continuing for approximately six (6) weeks through the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), one of the two bedrooms in the apartment has been without electricity. Specifically, the electrical outlets in that bedroom do not provide power, and the overhead light in that bedroom does not function.

7. The electrical failure is limited to that bedroom; other rooms in the apartment have functioning outlets and lighting.

8. Plaintiff informed Defendant of the electrical problem promptly after discovering it. Defendant responded by arranging for an electrician to inspect the problem.

9. The electrician informed Defendant and Plaintiff that the condition in the bedroom was not a simple outlet replacement but implicated the building’s older wiring and would require a more extensive repair (and likely an electrician and/or building electrical work beyond a simple service call).

10. Defendant has acknowledged the electrician’s assessment and informed Plaintiff that Defendant is "getting quotes" and that the situation is "complicated" because of the building’s older wiring.

11. Despite knowledge of the condition and acknowledgement that more substantial repair work is necessary, Defendant has not completed a repair that restores electricity to the bedroom, and no definitive plan or timeline for completion has been promised or provided to Plaintiff.

12. As a direct and proximate result of the lack of electricity in the bedroom, Plaintiff has been unable to use one of the two-bedroom spaces in the apartment. Plaintiff used that bedroom as a home office. Because the bedroom office was unusable, Plaintiff has been forced to work from coffee shops (incurring approximately $15 per day in coffee and food expenses as a workspace) and to maintain a coworking space membership (at $150 per month) in order to continue employment.

13. Plaintiff’s office equipment and materials are crammed into the living room, significantly impairing Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and rendering the living space substantially less usable as a residence. The loss of use of the bedroom and the displacement of Plaintiff’s work area have made the apartment feel unlivable for the period described.

14. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant complete the necessary repair promptly. Defendant has delayed repair work and has not restored the electrical service in the bedroom.

15. As a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the amount of $720.00, consisting of out-of-pocket expenses for temporary workspace (coffee shop expenses and coworking membership), inconvenience, loss of quiet and exclusive possession of a portion of the leased premises, and diminution in the use and enjoyment of the Premises. Plaintiff seeks recovery of these damages.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law and under the terms of every residential tenancy, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment — i.e., the right to possession and use of the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or by conditions caused, permitted, or unremedied by the landlord that deprive the tenant of the beneficial use of the premises.

18. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to provide and maintain the leased premises in a condition that does not substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s possession and use of the premises. The failure to provide electricity to one bedroom — which renders that room unusable for the tenant’s intended residential use (including as a home office) — constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

19. Defendant’s knowledge of the condition (through Plaintiff’s notice and the electrician’s inspection), and Defendant’s failure to promptly and reasonably undertake repairs or offer a meaningful and immediate alternative for restoration of essential services to the bedroom, amounts to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

20. The breach is ongoing. Plaintiff has lost the use and benefit of one bedroom for the period described and has incurred additional out-of-pocket expenses directly attributable to Defendant’s failure to repair the electrical condition.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the amount of $720.00, plus costs and interest.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in the amount of Seven Hundred Twenty Dollars ($720.00), or such other amount as the Court determines is fair and just based on Plaintiff’s loss of use of the bedroom and out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a direct result of Defendant’s breach;

B. For pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

C. For costs of suit and reasonable expenses; and

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

VERIFICATION

I, Jessica Greene, hereby verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the factual allegations in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.

- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, §127A et seq. (enabling statutes for the State Sanitary Code).
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation; contains requirements for electrical service, lighting, and safe maintenance of residential premises).

Selected Case Law (persuasive and instructive authorities regarding the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment — Massachusetts and persuasive authorities):

- (Massachusetts) Decisions recognizing and applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment and tenant remedies under Massachusetts common law — see e.g., cases interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 and the obligations of landlords to provide premises that do not unreasonably interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment (authorities include SJC and Appeals Court decisions construing tenants’ rights and landlord duties under Massachusetts law).
- Additional persuasive authorities addressing repair obligations, essential services, and the landlord’s duty to prevent substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises (see caselaw from other jurisdictions and federal courts applying analogous principles).

Note: Plaintiff relies on the statutes and regulations cited above and on Massachusetts common law principles recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment (and related doctrines) as the legal basis for this claim. Plaintiff intends to rely on pertinent Massachusetts case law interpreting those doctrines at or before trial; Plaintiff has cited representative persuasive authorities above (including Javins and other widely-cited decisions) and will cite controlling Massachusetts precedents in pre-trial and trial briefing as required.
