Mark Davis
Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Plaintiff, Laura Thompson ("Plaintiff" or "Laura"), is an adult resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant, Mark Davis ("Defendant" or "Mark"), is the father of the parties' child and resides in New Hampshire (or alleges a planned relocation to New Hampshire). Defendant's last known contact information is in his files with the Court.

3. The minor child subject to this action is:
   - Sophie Davis, age 8 (hereinafter "Sophie").

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law governing custody and modification of custody orders and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), codified in Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody order was entered in this Court when the parties and child resided in the Cambridge area, and Plaintiff and the child continue to reside in this County.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

5. On or about March 15, 2020, this Court entered an order providing that Plaintiff have primary physical custody of Sophie and that Defendant have parenting time consisting of Wednesdays (overnight) and every other weekend. That order was entered with the parties and the child living in close proximity in the Cambridge area and with the expectation that school attendance and after-school activities would not be disrupted by travel time between households.

6. The existing order and shared parenting schedule were adopted and implemented based on the then-existing circumstances, including short travel times between the parties' residences and proximity to Sophie's school and extracurricular activities.

7. Since entry of the order, Defendant has accepted employment in New Hampshire and now intends to relocate and reside there. Defendant insists on retaining the identical Wednesday overnight midweek schedule and the existing every-other-weekend schedule despite the relocation to New Hampshire.

8. If Defendant remains resident in New Hampshire and continues to exercise the present midweek overnight parenting time, Sophie would be required to travel by motor vehicle approximately ninety (90) minutes each way, in normal traffic, for the Wednesday overnight parenting time and early-morning return for school on Thursdays. Those drives would be long, onerous, and inconsistent with Sophie's education and extracurricular schedule.

9. Sophie has begun to express anxiety about the frequent long drives and about missing or arriving late to after-school activities. Plaintiff has observed changes in Sophie's demeanor and has specific concerns about Sophie's sleep, anxiety, and disruption to her school-day routine if the current schedule were enforced against the practical realities of the relocation.

10. The requested change in Defendant's residence and the practical effects of the relocation constitute a substantial change in circumstances from those that existed at the time the Court entered the March 15, 2020 custody order.

11. Continuing to require Sophie to undertake midweek overnight travel of approximately ninety (90) minutes each way would result in material harm to Sophie's school attendance, her participation in after-school programs, her daily routine, and her emotional well-being.

CAUSE OF ACTION — MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS

12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs and incorporates them by reference.

13. Massachusetts law permits modification of an existing custody order upon a showing that (a) there has been a material change in circumstances since issuance of the order, and (b) modification is in the best interests of the child. The material change here includes Defendant's relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting impracticability and harmful effect of midweek overnight parenting time given school and activity schedules.

14. Sophie’s best interests will be served by a parenting schedule that minimizes long midweek travel, preserves consistent school attendance and participation in after-school activities, reduces child stress and anxiety, and accommodates the distance between the parents’ residences.

15. Plaintiff proposes the following modification of the existing custody/visitation order:
   a. Terminate Defendant's Wednesday overnight midweek parenting time (suspend midweek overnight visits), and replace midweek contact with reasonable alternatives such as midweek phone/video calls and, where feasible, same-day after-school pick-ups/returns that do not require an overnight or that do not interfere with Sophie's school attendance.
   b. Modify the weekend schedule to reflect the increased distance between the parties so that parenting time is practically manageable and minimizes the number of school-day interruptions. Proposed alternative options include, but are not limited to:
      i. Every-other-weekend parenting time to begin Friday after school (or Friday evening), with return Sunday evening (or Monday morning when appropriate), OR
      ii. One extended weekend per month (for example, first full weekend of each month) combined with shorter, frequent daytime visits or video calls during the other weekends, OR
      iii. Designation of a neutral, reasonable meeting location (e.g., a midpoint or public transit hub) for exchanges to reduce travel burden on the child and the parent exercising time.
   c. Any necessary provisions for travel, exchange logistics, school notification, and communication regarding Sophie's activities and health to be included in the modified order.
   d. Temporary relief pending final hearing: suspend midweek overnight parenting time and implement an interim schedule consistent with the above proposals to prevent ongoing disruption and harm to Sophie while this matter is pending.

16. The requested modifications are in Sophie's best interests and are narrowly drawn to address the material change in circumstances resulting from Defendant's relocation while preserving Defendant's relationship with Sophie through reasonable, developmentally appropriate parenting time.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:

A. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the March 15, 2020 custody order;
B. Modify the existing custody/parenting-time order by:
   1. Removing/suspending Defendant's Wednesday overnight midweek parenting time; and
   2. Modifying the weekend parenting-time schedule to a form that accommodates the distance between the parties' residences and Sophie's educational and extracurricular needs, as described above (or in such other manner as the Court deems in Sophie's best interests);
C. Order such temporary relief as the Court deems appropriate pending final hearing, including immediate suspension of the midweek overnight visit;
D. Order that the parties cooperate to effectuate exchanges at mutually reasonable locations and times to minimize disruption to Sophie's schooling and activities;
E. Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable under the circumstances, including reasonable costs and fees if appropriate; and
F. Schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint.

- Relevant probate and family court rules and local rules governing custody proceedings and modification practice

Massachusetts Cases and Principles (representative)
- Cases recognizing that modification requires a showing of material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order and that the modification must be in the best interests of the child (courts routinely apply the "material change" standard and consider child's best interests factors)
- Cases applying the best-interests-of-the-child standard to custody and parenting-time disputes, including consideration of school attendance, extracurricular activities, stability, and emotional well-being
- Cases addressing parental relocation and its effect on parenting-time schedules and child welfare; courts often modify orders to accommodate distance while balancing preservation of parent-child relationships
- Cases and decisions interpreting the scope and application of the UCCJEA for interstate custody matters
- Decisions addressing temporary or emergency relief to prevent ongoing harm to a child pending a full hearing
- Decisions discussing exchange logistics and use of neutral locations to minimize child disruption where parents live at a distance

(If specific case citations and precise statutory section citations are required for filing, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court or counsel direct Plaintiff to exact authorities; Plaintiff will rely on the Court's rules and guidance and is prepared to supplement with precise citations on request.)

----------

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint and grant the relief requested above.
