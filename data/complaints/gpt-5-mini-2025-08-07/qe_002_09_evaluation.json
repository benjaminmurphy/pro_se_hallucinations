It does not frame the landlord\u2019s omissions as a breach of quiet enjoyment or articulate the legal standard for that covenant, so it does not provide authority for the specific quiet-enjoyment proposition stated.",

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cRather section 235-b of the Real Property Law was designed to give rise to an implied promise on the part of the landlord that both the demised premises and the areas within the landlord\u2019s control are fit for human occupation at the inception of the tenancy and that they will remain so throughout the lease term.\u2026 Inasmuch as the landlord is vested with the ultimate control and responsibility for the building, it is he who has a corresponding nondelegable and nonwaivable duty to maintain it. The obligation of the tenant to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord\u2019s satisfactory maintenance of the premises in habitable condition.\u201d"

It concerns administrative law, DPU authority, rate base, amortization, and related procedural issues, not landlord-tenant law. It does not discuss, recognize, or analyze any landlord obligations to maintain premises, so citing it for Massachusetts landlord-tenant duties is inaccurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "This court has not previously dealt with the question whether the department may lawfully permit a utility to recover prudently incurred costs of a construction project reasonably abandoned prior to its completion. The appellants point out that Pilgrim II never generated any electricity and argue that, until such an asset has \u201ccome on line,\u201d its costs may not be reflected in rates. They point to no statutory basis for this argument. We have considered the right of a utility to reflect in its rates the prudently incurred cost of plant reasonably abandoned before it was fully depreciated."
