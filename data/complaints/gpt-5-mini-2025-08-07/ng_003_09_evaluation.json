      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns foreseeability of harms from negligent storage and maintenance of merchandise and failure to protect invitees, but Palsgraf involves railroad guards jostling a passenger\u2019s package on a platform, not storage/maintenance of merchandise. More importantly, Cardozo\u2019s opinion holds that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were NOT within the foreseeable orbit of risk and that, as to her, the guards\u2019 conduct was not negligence at all. Thus, the case stands for the opposite principle: no liability where the harm to the plaintiff was not a foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s conduct.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe conduct of the defendant\u2019s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus removed. \u2026 If no hazard was apparent to the eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to her, did not take to itself the quality of a tort\u2026\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns a storeowner\u2019s duty to protect invitees from hazards created by how goods are stored or displayed on premises. MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. deals with a manufacturer\u2019s tort duty to remote purchasers (and, in this excerpt, the dissent\u2019s view about privity and inherently dangerous products), not premises liability or duties of storeowners regarding display or storage of merchandise. The case therefore does not establish or discuss the proposition claimed and is an inapposite citation for that rule.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe present suit is an action for negligence brought by the subvendee of the motor car against the manufacturer as the original vendor\u2026 It has heretofore been held in this state that the liability of the vendor of a manufactured article for negligence arising out of the existence of defects therein does not extend to strangers injured in consequence of such defects but is confined to the immediate vendee.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns a storeowner\u2019s duty to protect invitees from hazards created by the way goods are stored and displayed. Escola deals instead with a bottler\u2019s negligence and the application of res ipsa loquitur to an exploding Coca\u2011Cola bottle supplied by the defendant, not with duties of a storeowner or hazards from store display methods. Nothing in the opinion discusses premises liability, invitees, or storage/display duties of retailers, so it does not support the claimed proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Plaintiff, a waitress in a restaurant, was injured when a bottle of Coca Cola broke in her hand. She alleged that defendant company, which had bottled and delivered the alleged defective bottle to her employer, was negligent in selling \u201cbottles containing said beverage which on account of excessive pressure of gas or by reason of some defect in the bottle was dangerous . . . and likely to explode.\u201d \u2026 Plaintiff then rested her case, having announced to the court that being unable to show any specific acts of negligence she relied completely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur."
