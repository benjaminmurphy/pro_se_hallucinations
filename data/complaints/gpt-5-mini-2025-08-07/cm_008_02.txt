==============================================

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

1. Parties and Residence
1.1 Plaintiff: Emma Thompson, residing at [address omitted], may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant: David Miller (residence/address of defendant currently on file with the Court).
1.3 Child: The custody order that is the subject of this Complaint affects the parties’ minor child, Sophia Miller, born [date of birth omitted for privacy], age 10.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Probate and Family Court’s authority to modify custody and visitation orders affecting minors and to make determinations in the best interests of a child. The original judgment/order concerning custody and visitation between the parties was entered in this Court on May 15, 2022. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court where the child resides and where the underlying decree was entered.

3. Existing Custody Order
3.1 On or about May 15, 2022, this Court entered a custody order that (a) awarded the parties shared legal custody of the minor child, (b) designated Plaintiff, Emma Thompson, as the child’s primary residential parent, and (c) provided Defendant, David Miller, with substantial weekend parenting time, explicitly including overnight parenting time that includes Sunday nights.
3.2 The 2022 order also required the parties to cooperate on school matters and to keep each other informed of school-related issues and decisions affecting the child.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 Since entry of the 2022 custody order, a material change in circumstances has occurred that affects the welfare and best interests of the minor child.
4.2 Over approximately the past year, Defendant has repeatedly kept the child home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, stating that the child “needs a mental health day.” These Monday absences are not supported by any medical documentation, notes from a licensed health professional, or any formal recommendation from the child’s school.
4.3 Defendant has declined to provide Plaintiff with records, notes, or other verification of claimed medical or mental health needs that would justify repeated school absences.
4.4 Because of these Monday absences, the child’s school has issued truancy warnings to Plaintiff as the primary residential parent. Plaintiff has repeatedly attempted to address attendance with Defendant, who has not cooperated with Plaintiff to resolve the attendance issues or to ensure the child attends school on Monday mornings after Defendant’s weekend time.
4.5 Additionally, Defendant has regularly refused to transport or bring the child to scheduled tutoring or academic support sessions that occur during his weekend parenting time, interfering with the child’s access to necessary educational supports.
4.6 As a direct result of Defendant’s actions and the increased absences and missed academic supports, the child’s grades and standardized test scores have declined over the past year, compared to the child’s academic standing when the 2022 order was entered.
4.7 The child’s decreased academic performance and the truancy warnings place the child at risk of continuing educational harm. The circumstances described above are substantially different from the circumstances that existed at the time the prior order was entered and constitute a material change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of the existing custody/visitation order.

5. Legal Basis for Relief
5.1 Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody order on the ground of a material change in circumstances and in the best interests of the child.
5.2 The Probate and Family Court has authority to modify custody and parenting time orders when modification is warranted by a material change in circumstances and when the modification is in the child’s best interests.
5.3 The repeated school absences without medical documentation, the refusal to cooperate concerning school matters and tutoring, and the demonstrable decline in the child’s academic performance are material changes directly affecting the child’s welfare and present a justiciable basis for modification of the prior order.

6. Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emma Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
6.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2022 custody order that warrants modification of the prior order;
6.2 Modify the prior order to grant Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding the child’s school attendance and related routine educational decisions (including but not limited to attendance, tutoring, after-school academic supports, communication with school personnel, and school-based interventions) while preserving such consultation between parents as is reasonable under the circumstances;
6.3 Alternatively or in addition, modify the parenting time schedule by eliminating Sunday overnight parenting time with Defendant (or otherwise restrict parenting time that includes an overnight immediately prior to a school day), so as to ensure the child’s consistent school attendance and to prevent further Monday truancies;
6.4 Order that Defendant must notify Plaintiff in advance of any intent to keep the child out of school and must provide, prior to any future absence for alleged medical or mental health reasons, documentation from a licensed medical or mental health provider supporting any such recommended absence from school;
6.5 Order that Defendant cooperate with and facilitate the child’s participation in all school-based or court-ordered tutoring or academic support sessions, including timely transportation if those sessions fall during his parenting time, or otherwise adjust parenting time to prevent interference with required academic supports;
6.6 Order such temporary and/or emergency relief as the Court deems necessary to protect the child’s interests while this matter is pending, including, if appropriate, temporary modification of Defendant’s overnight parenting time pending a full hearing;
6.7 Order both parties to participate in any evaluation, mediation, parent coordination, or reunification/parenting education programs the Court deems helpful to resolve disputes and to promote the child’s best interests;
6.8 Award such other relief as the Court deems equitable and in the best interests of the child, including but not limited to costs and fees, and any modifications necessary to ensure the child’s regular school attendance and academic progress.

7. Request for Hearing and Temporary Relief
7.1 Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a hearing on this Complaint as soon as practicable.
7.2 Plaintiff further requests that the Court consider and grant temporary relief (including temporary modification of Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time or other temporary restrictions) pending a full hearing, if the Court finds such measures are necessary to prevent further immediate educational harm to the child.

8. Verification
8.1 Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the allegations set forth in this Complaint are true and accurate to the best of her knowledge, information, and belief.

Respectfully submitted,
