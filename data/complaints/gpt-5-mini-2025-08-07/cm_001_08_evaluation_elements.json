      "reasoning": "Section 6.1 (and subparts i\u2013ii, C\u2013F) sets out concrete modifications sought: restrict overnights to nights Defendant is off-duty (or require verifiable advance proof), convert overnights to daytime/evening when he works, require advance notice and vetting of third parties, provide work schedule to the parties/the Court, and related temporary relief\u2014a specific and measurable change to the Existing Order."

    "best_interests_of_child": {
      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "The complaint links the alleged change in circumstances to risks to the children\u2019s health, safety, welfare and stability (\u00b6\u00b64.5, 4.6, 6.1(A)\u2013(B)) and expressly asks for modifications to protect the children pending hearing (\u00b6\u00b67.1, 8.2). Those factual allegations reasonably plead that the requested modification is necessary for the children\u2019s best interests."
