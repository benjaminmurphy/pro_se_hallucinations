COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
BERKSHIRE COUNTY
SUFFOLK SUPERIOR COURT DOCKET NO. ___________

JESSICA CARTER,
     Plaintiff,

v.

THOMAS REYNOLDS,
     Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jessica Carter (hereinafter “Plaintiff”), by and through herself pro se, complains against Defendant Thomas Reynolds (hereinafter “Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Carter is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Thomas Reynolds is the owner and occupant of the real property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201, at all times relevant to this Complaint.

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on July 15, 2023 at or near the public sidewalk adjacent to 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in Berkshire Superior Court pursuant to the Massachusetts venue statutes because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Berkshire County, and Defendant’s property is located in Berkshire County.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because Defendant owns and resides at property located in Massachusetts and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. For a substantial period of time prior to July 15, 2023, a major branch of a large maple tree located on Defendant’s property overhung the public sidewalk in front of Defendant’s property at 123 Maple Street. The branch was visibly cracked, droopy, and appeared to be dead, decayed, or structurally unsound.

7. Plaintiff and neighbors observed and identified the cracked condition of the branch. On multiple occasions prior to July 15, 2023, neighbors informed Defendant of the cracked branch and recommended that Defendant have the tree inspected by an arborist or otherwise remediate the hazardous condition.

8. Defendant responded to such inquiries by stating he would “deal with it in the spring,” but did not remediate, inspect, or secure the branch despite actual knowledge of its dangerous condition and the proximity of a public sidewalk and pedestrian traffic.

9. On July 15, 2023, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm of no unusual severity or intensity, the cracked branch unexpectedly and foreseeably fractured and fell directly onto Plaintiff as she was lawfully walking along the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s property while carrying grocery bags.

10. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, causing her to be knocked to the ground. Plaintiff suffered an acute shoulder strain and multiple bruises as a direct and proximate result of the falling branch.

11. As a result of Defendant’s negligent failure to inspect, maintain, remove, prune, or otherwise make safe the cracked, drooping branch, Plaintiff sustained injuries requiring medical treatment and clinical care. Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical expenses to date are approximately $2,500.

12. As a direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff was unable to work at her retail employment for approximately one week and sustained wage loss in the approximate amount of $600.

13. Plaintiff has and will continue to suffer pain, suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, disability, loss of enjoyment of life, and diminished capacity to labor and perform daily activities.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to maintain his premises (including trees and branches located on his property) in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or remedy dangerous conditions that he knew or should have known about.

16. Defendant breached that duty by negligently failing to inspect, evaluate, prune, treat, support, secure, or remove the cracked, drooping branch; by failing to obtain professional arboricultural assessment or to otherwise take reasonable steps to reduce the foreseeable risk posed by the branch; and by allowing a dangerous condition to persist in close proximity to a public walkway used by pedestrians.

17. Defendant’s conduct was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages because the fall of the cracked branch was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care to address a known hazardous condition directly over a public pedestrian path.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the injuries, damages, and losses described above, including but not limited to medical expenses of approximately $2,500, lost wages of approximately $600, past and future pain and suffering, and other general and special damages.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including recovery for past and future medical expenses, past and future lost earnings and lost earning capacity, and past and future pain, suffering, and emotional distress;

B. Awarding Plaintiff special damages in the approximate amount of $3,100 (approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and $600 in lost wages), subject to proof at trial;

C. Awarding costs, interest, and disbursements allowable by law;

D. Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
