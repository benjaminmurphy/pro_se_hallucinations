Although the case\u2019s main holding is about an implied warranty of habitability, it expressly treats the covenant of quiet enjoyment as an existing, implied lease covenant whose scope had been judicially expanded. This directly supports the proposition that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in leases and tenancies.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Thus, for example, the doctrine of \u201cconstructive eviction,\u201d which expanded the traditional \u201ccovenant of quiet enjoyment\u201d from simply a guarantee of the tenant\u2019s possession of the premises (see Connor v. Bernheimer (N.Y. Com. Pleas 1875) 6 Daly 295, 299; Gorgeous v. Lewis (1912) 20 Cal.App. 255, 258 [128 P. 768]) to a protection of his \u201cbeneficial enjoyment\u201d of the premises through the maintenance of basic, necessary services (Groh v.

Therefore it does not support the proposition for which it is cited.",

We conclude that paragraphs two and three of the restraining order are not content or viewpoint neutral.

We reverse paragraphs two and three of the injunction for the reasons stated in our recent opinion in Horizon Health Ctr. v. Felicissimo...."
