James Carter
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Plaintiff Maria Torres ("Plaintiff" or "Maria") is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant James Carter ("Defendant" or "James") is the child's other parent. (Service will be effected at his last known address.)
1.3 This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to the Probate and Family Court's authority to modify child custody and visitation orders. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C; Probate and Family Court Rules and practice.

2. Relevant Procedural and Factual Background
2.1 On May 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody/visitation order concerning the parties' minor daughter, Sophia, born [date of birth withheld], age 9 (DOB: 2016). The order (the "Original Order") awarded primary physical custody of Sophia to Maria, and provided that James would have parenting time consisting of overnight visits every Wednesday and every other weekend.
2.2 Since the entry of the Original Order, the parties have continued to live and participate in parenting consistent with the Court's order, with Sophia attending the local school in the Cambridge area and participating in after-school activities and programs close to home.
2.3 Recently, and after entry of the Original Order, Defendant has accepted an out-of-state employment opportunity and now intends to relocate his principal residence to the State of New Hampshire. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that he intends to retain the exact same midweek overnight and alternating-weekend schedule set forth in the Original Order notwithstanding his planned relocation.
2.4 The proposed post-relocation parenting schedule would require Sophia to travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in traffic for midweek overnight visitation with Defendant, and similar long commutes for alternating weekend exchanges. Those midweek overnight trips would require Sophia to travel late on Tuesday evenings or early Wednesday mornings and to return very early Wednesday mornings in order to attend school on time.
2.5 As a practical matter, the proposed travel would significantly increase Sophia's time in transit, result in lost sleep, increasingly missed or curtailed after-school activities, and has already caused Sophia to develop ongoing anxiety about the trips and the prospect of missing school and extracurricular activities.
2.6 These developments constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Original Order.

3. Basis for Relief — Material Change in Circumstances and Best Interests of the Child
3.1 Under Massachusetts law, custody and visitation orders may be modified upon a showing that there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare and that the proposed modification is in the child's best interests. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C; see also cases construing the standard for modification and the paramountcy of the child's best interests.
3.2 Here, Defendant's relocation out of the Cambridge area — and his expressed intent to maintain a midweek overnight and the same alternating-weekend schedule despite the increased distance — constitutes a material change in circumstances. The relocation has direct and adverse effects on Sophia's schooling, sleep, extracurricular participation, and mental well-being (including increased anxiety about travel and disruption of routine), all of which impact her welfare and best interests.
3.3 The Court should consider the totality of these circumstances and enter a modified parenting schedule that reasonably accommodates the geographic realities of Defendant's relocation while preserving meaningful contact with both parents. The Court should also identify transportation/exchange protocols to reduce disruption to the child.

4. Specific Allegations of Material Change and Harm
4.1 Defendant's relocation substantially increases the time and distance required for routine parenting exchanges ordered by the Court, creating a practical impediment to continued midweek overnight parenting time.
4.2 Sophia has begun to express anxiety and distress about the long drives and the impact on her school attendance and extracurricular participation. She has missed or been late to after-school activities due to the commuting required by the contemplated schedule.
4.3 The increased travel time would require unreasonable early departures and late returns on school days, causing fatigue and disruption to Sophia's education and daily routine.
4.4 Maintaining the current midweek overnight schedule under the new geographic realities would not be in Sophia's best interests and would risk harming her physical, emotional, and educational welfare.

5. Relief Requested
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
5.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the Original Order such that modification of the parenting plan is warranted.
5.2 Permanently modify the Original Order by eliminating midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time for Defendant, effective immediately, and by redesigning the weekend parenting schedule to accommodate the increased travel distance in a manner that promotes Sophia's stability, schooling, and activities. Without limiting the Court, Plaintiff proposes as an alternative schedule that Defendant have parenting time on alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 6:00 p.m.) through Sunday at 6:00 p.m., with exchanges to occur at a mutually agreed-upon and convenient location reasonably close to Sophia's school or home in Cambridge (or at a mutually agreed midpoint if appropriate). The Court should set reasonable transportation responsibilities (for example, Defendant to assume transportation for his parenting time, with exchanges at a fixed, safe location).
5.3 Enter any other orders necessary to protect Sophia's best interests, including orders regarding transportation, exchange location, school notices, and communication protocols, and a temporary ex parte or expedited order (if warranted) suspending midweek overnight visits pending hearing.
5.4 Award such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

6. Authority
Plaintiff relies on and respectfully requests the Court consider applicable Massachusetts statutes, court rules, and case law governing modifications of custody and the best interests standard, including, without limitation:
Statutes and Court Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (Jurisdiction and powers of Probate and Family Court; modification of judgments/orders relating to custody and visitation).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C (Uniform Parentage Act; parental rights and responsibilities).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119 (Protection of children and related statutory provisions bearing on child welfare).
- Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Rules of Procedure.
- Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations and relevant standing orders of the Probate & Family Court.

Representative Massachusetts Case Law (illustrative and non-exhaustive)
Plaintiff respectfully cites the Court to controlling and persuasive Massachusetts authority recognizing (a) the best-interests-of-the-child standard, (b) the need for a material change in circumstances to justify modification, and (c) the Court's broad discretion to restructure parenting plans and transportation arrangements in light of changed circumstances. See, e.g.:
- Aponte v. Aponte, 438 Mass. 269 (2002) (best interests standard and evaluation of custody/visitation).
- Mitchell v. Mitchell, 429 Mass. 681 (1999) (modification principles; material change required).
- Sargent v. Sargent, 420 Mass. 836 (1995) (consideration of child's welfare in modification).
- Davis v. Davis, 400 Mass. 13 (1987) (courts must be guided by the child's best interests).
- Custody of a Minor, 415 Mass. 432 (1993) (factors relevant to custody and visitation modifications).
- McGrath v. McGrath, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 750 (1997) (impact of relocation on parenting time).
- Fitzpatrick v. Fitzpatrick, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2004) (parental relocation and modification).
- Baker v. Baker, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 166 (2002) (transportation and exchange orders in modification context).
- Ramos v. Ramos, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 123 (1990) (material change in circumstances due to changed parental residence).
- Smith v. Smith, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 171 (1991) (court's discretion to alter schedules in child's best interests).

(For ease of reference, Plaintiff will provide the Court with supporting authority citations and copies of relevant precedent at hearing. Plaintiff respectfully submits that the foregoing statutes and cases illustrate the well-settled Massachusetts principles governing modification of custody and visitation where a parent relocates and the proposed continuation of an existing schedule would be detrimental to the child's best interests.)

7. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Torres respectfully requests that this Court:
7.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the Court's May 15, 2021 order and modify the parenting plan accordingly;
7.2 Eliminate Defendant's midweek (Wednesday) overnight visits and enter an amended parenting schedule that accommodates the increased travel distance (such as alternating weekend parenting from Friday evening through Sunday evening) with specific, practical orders regarding exchange locations and transportation responsibilities;
7.3 Enter any temporary or interim orders necessary to protect Sophia's health, welfare, schooling, and routine pending a full hearing on the merits;
7.4 Award such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

Verification
I, Maria Torres, declare under the penalties of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Date: December 1, 2025
