David Smith
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
   1.1 Plaintiff: Emily Johnson, residing at 617 Main Street, Apt. 3, Boston, MA (phone (617) 555-0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com).
   1.2 Defendant: David Smith, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts.
   1.3 Minor Child: Sophie Smith, born in 2015 (age 10).
   1.4 This Court has jurisdiction under the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Rules and applicable Massachusetts statutes governing custody and modification of custody orders. The original custody order was entered in this Court on May 15, 2016. Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

2. Nature of Action
   2.1 This is an action by the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, to modify the existing custody/parenting time order dated May 15, 2016. Plaintiff seeks an order modifying the allocation of physical custody and parenting time to increase Sophie's overnight and residential time with Plaintiff and to revise the parenting schedule to reflect current circumstances.

3. Background Facts and Existing Order
   3.1 On May 15, 2016, the Court entered an order awarding primary residence of the parties’ daughter, Sophie Smith, to Defendant David Smith.
   3.2 Under the 2016 order, Plaintiff was awarded limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner visit per week; Plaintiff’s parenting time was limited in scope.
   3.3 At the time of the 2016 order, Plaintiff was a graduate student, lived in a small studio apartment, and had an inflexible schedule that limited her availability for parenting and overnight care. Those circumstances informed the Court’s allocation of residential time.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
   4.1 Since entry of the 2016 order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and the ability of the parties to carry out the existing parenting plan:
      a. Plaintiff completed graduate school and obtained stable employment with regular daytime hours, eliminating prior scheduling constraints that previously limited her ability to care for Sophie.
      b. Plaintiff now resides in a two-bedroom apartment where Sophie has her own bedroom, providing appropriate space and stability for overnight stays and increased residential time.
      c. The child is now ten (10) years old—older and better able to tolerate and benefit from an increased, predictable parenting schedule and overnight stays with Plaintiff.
      d. The child’s therapist has advised that Sophie expresses feelings of guilt when she must leave Plaintiff after short visits and has communicated that Sophie wants more overnight time with Plaintiff. Sophie has provided a written letter to the Court expressing her desire for more time and additional overnights with Plaintiff.
      e. Defendant has refused to discuss or negotiate a modification to the parenting schedule, and becomes angry when the subject of increased time with Plaintiff is raised by Sophie, creating conflict and emotional strain affecting Sophie’s well-being.
   4.2 These post-order changes are material, were not contemplated at the time of entry of the 2016 order, and bear directly on the best interests and welfare of the child such that modification is warranted.

5. Best Interests of the Child
   5.1 Plaintiff alleges that, under the circumstances described above, modification of the existing custody/parenting plan to increase Sophie's time with Plaintiff is in the best interests of the child.
   5.2 Factors supporting modification include: improved parental capacity and stability of Plaintiff; a suitable living environment for increased parenting time; the child’s expressed preference (through therapist and direct letter to the Court) to spend more time and have overnights with Plaintiff; and the existing level of conflict created by Defendant’s refusal to negotiate, which negatively affects the child.
   5.3 Plaintiff requests that the Court consider the totality of the best-interest factors, including but not limited to those enumerated in applicable Massachusetts statutes and case law, and enter an order that promotes Sophie’s stability, emotional well-being, and meaningful relationships with both parents.

6. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:
   6.1 That the Court find and declare that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2016 custody order sufficient to justify modification of the prior order;
   6.2 That the Court modify the parenting schedule and award Plaintiff increased residential/overnight time with Sophie, including but not limited to a revised schedule providing substantially increased weekend and overnight parenting time and such additional regular weeknight parenting time as the Court deems appropriate;
   6.3 That the Court consider awarding joint legal custody or revising decision-making allocation if appropriate in light of the child’s best interests;
   6.4 That the Court order such other and further relief as is just and equitable under the circumstances, including but not limited to an order for mediation, evaluation, or appointment of a guardian ad litem or custody evaluator if the Court deems these steps necessary to determine the child’s best interests;
   6.5 That the Court grant such temporary orders as are necessary pending final resolution of this matter to protect the best interests of the child; and
   6.6 That the Court award Plaintiff costs, fees, and such other relief as the Court deems proper.

7. Verification
   7.1 I, Emily Johnson, verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the factual statements contained in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
