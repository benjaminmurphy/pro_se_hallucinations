MICHAEL DAVIS,
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff Jessica Taylor ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: (617) 555-0123; psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2. Defendant Michael Davis ("Defendant") is the other parent of the minor child and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.3. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws governing custody and the Probate and Family Court.

2. Minor Child
2.1. This action concerns the custody and parenting time of the parties’ minor child:
- Sophie Davis, age 8.

3. Existing Order
3.1. On March 15, 2021, the Probate and Family Court entered an order awarding primary physical custody of Sophie to Plaintiff, with Defendant granted scheduled parenting time consisting of midweek visits/overnights on Wednesdays and alternating weekends. The order was entered when both parents resided in the Cambridge area and Sophie attended a nearby Cambridge public school.
3.2. The current order is the controlling custody/parenting plan between the parties.

4. Material Change in Circumstances
4.1. Since entry of the March 15, 2021 order, there has been a material change in circumstances that substantially affects the welfare of the child and the ability of the parties to follow the existing custody/visitation order.
4.2. Specifically, Defendant has announced his intention to relocate to the State of New Hampshire for a job opportunity and insists on maintaining the same custodial/parenting time schedule (Wednesday overnight plus alternating weekends) despite the substantially increased distance between Defendant’s new residence and Sophie’s school and primary residence in Cambridge.
4.3. The relocation will require Sophie to travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in typical traffic for midweek parenting time exchanges. In practice, this will cause Sophie to: (a) undergo long midweek drives that disrupt school nights and sleep; (b) miss or arrive late to school and after-school activities; (c) experience significant anxiety about the travel and the logistics of returning to school the next morning; and (d) suffer interruptions to her established routine, which is important to her emotional and scholastic stability.
4.4. Plaintiff has observed and reasonably documented Sophie’s increased anxiety and reluctance concerning the proposed travel; Sophie has expressed stress about long drives, missing after-school activities, and waking very early to return for school.
4.5. The proposed continuation of midweek overnight visits from a New Hampshire residence will impose an undue burden on Sophie’s schooling, extracurricular activities, physical wellbeing, and emotional health and is not in Sophie’s best interests.

5. Legal Standard for Modification
5.1. Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant’s proposed relocation and the practical effects on the child constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the March 15, 2021 order, warranting modification of the custody/parenting time schedule.
5.2. Plaintiff alleges that continuation of the existing schedule under these new circumstances would be detrimental to the child’s best interests, and that a modification limiting midweek overnights and adjusting weekend parenting time to reflect the increased distance is necessary to protect the child’s welfare.

6. Relief Requested
Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order modifying the existing custody/parenting time order as follows:
6.1. Suspend and remove Defendant’s midweek overnight (Wednesdays) parenting time, permanently or until otherwise further ordered by the Court, because midweek overnights are not reasonably compatible with the Defendant’s new out-of-state residence and because such overnights would unduly interfere with the child’s schooling, sleep, and after-school activities.
6.2. Modify Defendant’s alternating weekend parenting time to a schedule that is workable given the distance, such as (but not limited to):
   - alternating weekends from Friday evening through Sunday evening (with exchanges at a mutually agreeable, safe, and convenient location in or near Cambridge), or
   - extended alternate weekends (e.g., every other weekend plus one mid-month long visit) as the Court finds appropriate to preserve meaningful parenting time while minimizing midweek travel strain on the child;
   - or such other modifications as the Court finds are in Sophie’s best interests and reasonably accommodate the distance.
6.3. Order that all exchanges be conducted at a mutually agreed, safe, public location in or near Cambridge or, if the parties cannot agree, at a location designated by the Court, and that exchanges be conducted at times that do not cause Sophie to miss school.
6.4. Grant any temporary relief the Court deems appropriate, including but not limited to temporary modification suspending midweek overnight parenting time pending final hearing on the merits.
6.5. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the child’s best interests and to effectuate a workable parenting plan.

7. Basis for Relief (Summary)
7.1. The relocation to New Hampshire and Defendant’s insistence on maintaining the same midweek overnight and alternating weekend schedule represent a substantial and material change in circumstances since the March 15, 2021 order.
7.2. The requested modification is necessary to protect Sophie’s physical, emotional, and educational welfare and to preserve meaningful, realistic parenting time for Defendant that does not impair the child’s routine or school attendance.
7.3. Plaintiff is prepared to submit evidence at hearing supporting these factual allegations, including testimony about Sophie’s anxiety and the practical effects of the travel, proposed schedules, and any necessary exhibits (school schedules, evidence of travel times, etc.).

8. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
8.1. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the March 15, 2021 order;
8.2. Modify the custody/parenting time order to remove Defendant’s midweek overnight (Wednesdays) parenting time and to adopt an adjusted weekend schedule compatible with Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire and Sophie’s best interests, as set forth in Paragraph 6 above or as the Court deems appropriate;
8.3. Order exchanges at an appropriate location and time to prevent Sophie from missing school and extracurricular activities;
8.4. Grant temporary relief suspending midweek overnights pending final hearing, if the Court deems such temporary relief necessary;
8.5. Grant any further relief deemed just and proper.

9. Certificate of Service
9.1. Plaintiff will serve the Defendant with a copy of this Complaint and the Court’s summons in accordance with Massachusetts law and rules governing service in family and probate matters.

VERIFICATION

Notice to Court and Parties
- Plaintiff is prepared to present evidence at hearing supporting the allegations above regarding the Defendant’s relocation, the length of travel, the child’s reactions and anxiety, and the detrimental impact on the child’s schooling and activities.
- Plaintiff requests a prompt hearing on temporary relief given the impending relocation and anticipated immediate impact on the child’s routine and welfare.

Important Note Regarding Legal Citations and Case Law
- The foregoing Complaint states the facts and the requested relief under the controlling principle in Massachusetts family law that a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and that any modification must be in the best interests of the child. Plaintiff intends to rely upon applicable Massachusetts statutes and case law at hearing (including, but not limited to, the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, relevant chapters of the Massachusetts General Laws governing custody and the Probate and Family Court, and Massachusetts appellate decisions interpreting the standard for modification and the "best interests of the child" test).
- Because the Plaintiff is proceeding pro se, she requests that the Court accept this Complaint, schedule an initial hearing, and allow the parties to present legal authority and evidence at the hearing. If the Court or opposing counsel requires specific legal briefs and citation lists in advance, Plaintiff will prepare and submit those authorities in support of her position or request reasonable time to do so.
