Plaintiff/Complainant

v.

Michael Thornton
Defendant/Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1. Plaintiff/Complainant: Lisa Thornton ("Plaintiff"), phone (617) 555-0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com. Plaintiff is an adult resident subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
1.2. Defendant/Respondent: Michael Thornton ("Defendant"), the other parent of the minor child identified below, is subject to this Court’s jurisdiction.
1.3. Minor child: Emma Thornton, born 2013 (age 12).
1.4. This Court has authority to hear this Complaint under Massachusetts law governing allocation and modification of custody and care of minor children, including G. L. c. 208, § 31 and related statutes and rules.

2. Background and Prior Order
2.1. On or about June 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order providing for shared physical custody of the parties’ child, Emma, on a one-week-on, one-week-off alternating schedule (the "2018 Order").
2.2. The 2018 Order worked for several years while both parents lived nearby and were able to provide routine, safe care for Emma.

3. Change in Circumstances
3.1. Since entry of the 2018 Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.
3.2. Specifically, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition (the “Condition”). The Condition has substantially worsened within the past year and causes frequent balance problems, falls, and unpredictable mobility limitations.
3.3. Defendant has fallen several times at home. Defendant’s treating physician has explicitly advised that Defendant should not be left alone with the minor child in situations involving stairs, transfers, or circumstances requiring quick physical response.
3.4. Despite knowledge of these medical restrictions, Defendant insists on maintaining the exact 50/50 alternating-week physical custody schedule.
3.5. On multiple occasions, Defendant has unreasonably relied on the parties’ 12-year-old daughter, Emma, to assist Defendant with physical tasks that are beyond a child’s maturity and capacity, including helping Defendant to transfer from a wheelchair to bed and retrieving items for Defendant. These incidents placed Emma in situations beyond her developmental capacity and pose a risk to her safety, physical well-being, and emotional welfare.
3.6. Plaintiff has attempted to address these safety concerns with Defendant and to reach a reasonable accommodation for parenting time that accounts for Defendant’s medical limitations; Defendant has refused to modify the current schedule or to accept a workable safety plan.

4. Basis for Modification
4.1. The material and substantial change in circumstances described above—Defendant’s progressive neurological illness, his documented falls, the medical advice that he not be alone with Emma in certain situations, and the inappropriate reliance on the child to assist Defendant—has materially affected and continues to affect the health, safety, and welfare of the minor child.
4.2. Under Massachusetts law, custody orders may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances that affects the child’s welfare and that modification is in the child’s best interests. Plaintiff alleges that the change set forth above satisfies this legal standard and warrants modification of the 2018 Order.
4.3. Plaintiff alleges that immediate temporary relief is necessary to prevent ongoing risk to the minor child while this action is pending.

5. Requested Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
5.1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2018 Order and that the change affects the welfare of the minor child.
5.2. Modify the physical custody arrangement to designate Plaintiff as the primary residential custodian of Emma, with the Defendant’s parenting time limited and structured to reflect Defendant’s medical limitations and the child’s safety.
5.3. Establish a parenting-time schedule for Defendant that:
    (a) provides daytime parenting time that is limited to circumstances in which Defendant is not alone with Emma in situations involving stairs, transfers, or any activity where a quick physical response may be required; and/or
    (b) provides supervised parenting time when the Court deems supervision necessary for Emma’s safety until Defendant demonstrates, by medical evidence and/or occupational/physical therapy assessment, that Defendant can safely exercise unsupervised parenting time; and
    (c) provides reasonable overnight parenting time only if the Court finds that Defendant can safely meet the child’s needs overnight without placing the child at risk, as evidenced by current medical and rehabilitative assessments.
5.4. Require Defendant to provide current medical records and authorizations sufficient for the Court and, if appointed, a guardian ad litem or other evaluator to review Defendant’s diagnosis, prognosis, and restrictions, and to permit an independent medical or rehabilitative assessment if the Court deems it appropriate.
5.5. Appoint a Guardian ad Litem or court evaluator to evaluate and report on what parenting-time arrangements are in Emma’s best interests given Defendant’s medical condition.
5.6. Grant temporary emergency relief as necessary (e.g., temporarily suspend unsupervised overnight parenting time for Defendant and order supervised or daytime-only parenting time) pending final resolution, to protect the minor child’s safety.
5.7. Order any other relief that the Court deems just and proper to protect Emma’s health, safety, and welfare, including reimbursement of costs and reasonable fees, if appropriate.
5.8. Order that a copy of this Complaint, together with notice of the hearing date and this Court’s temporary orders, be served on Defendant in accordance with Court rules.

6. Verification
I, Lisa Thornton, plaintiff in this action, declare under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Dated: December 1, 2025
