COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Turner, pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Lawson and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual and resident of Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides at 12 Elm St, Apt. 2, Somerville, MA 02144.

2. Defendant Mark Lawson is the landlord/owner of the residential property located at 12 Elm St, Somerville, Massachusetts, and is a person who manages and receives rent from tenants at that property.

3. This action arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases under Massachusetts law. Jurisdiction is proper in the Somerville District Court because the rental unit is located in Somerville and the amount in controversy is within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 11, and general venue principles because the property and events giving rise to this action occurred in Somerville, Massachusetts.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a written lease for Apartment 2, 12 Elm St, Somerville, Massachusetts, commencing on January 15, 2022, for which Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,800.

6. Plaintiff’s lease specifically (and by operation of law) includes the covenant of quiet enjoyment — an implied covenant that Plaintiff shall be able to occupy her apartment without substantial interference by the landlord or persons for whom the landlord is responsible.

7. Beginning approximately six months ago (approximately June 2025), new tenants moved into the unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment (the “Upstairs Tenants”).

8. Since the Upstairs Tenants moved in, Plaintiff has been subjected to repeated, severe and unreasonable noise disturbances emanating from the unit above, including but not limited to: heavy stomping and pounding at all hours, loud music late at night and into early morning hours, and sounds of furniture being moved and dragged across the floor at or near midnight.

9. The noise is persistent and ongoing, occurring nightly and often during the hours after 10:00 p.m., waking Plaintiff multiple times a night and significantly disrupting Plaintiff’s ability to sleep.

10. Plaintiff has personally asked the Upstairs Tenants on multiple occasions to reduce the noise. They complied briefly for about one week but then resumed the disruptive conduct.

11. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant (the landlord) on approximately five or six separate occasions about the Upstairs Tenants’ excessive noise and the resultant loss of sleep and ability to use her apartment peacefully. Each complaint was made in person and by telephone and included explicit description of the noise and the times it occurs.

12. On one occasion Defendant spoke with the Upstairs Tenants but thereafter told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live,” and otherwise failed to take reasonable steps to abate the ongoing noise problem or to ensure Plaintiff’s ability to enjoy her apartment.

13. Defendant, as landlord, has control over the property and the tenancy, and had the capacity to take remedial action reasonably calculated to abate the interference (including issuing a written notice, warning, or lease enforcement measure, or pursuing eviction or other lawful remedies against the Upstairs Tenants), but has failed to do so.

14. Because of the noise, Plaintiff’s sleep has been severely diminished. For an extended period Plaintiff has averaged approximately four to five hours of sleep per night. Plaintiff’s daytime functioning has been materially impaired: Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk which Plaintiff attributes to sleeplessness caused by the noise.

15. Plaintiff’s treating physician prescribed sleep medication to address the effects of the chronic sleep deprivation directly caused by the noise. Plaintiff pays approximately $40 per month for those medications.

16. Plaintiff has incurred other out-of-pocket expenses intended to mitigate the disturbance, including the purchase of earplugs, a white-noise machine, and attempts to rearrange furniture, none of which have abated the substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to take action to abate the disturbance or otherwise enforce the lease terms to ensure quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages including physical and mental distress, loss of sleep, diminished enjoyment and use of the leased premises, medical expenses (prescription medication), lost income or employment consequences (work warning), and other economic and non-economic damages.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.

19. Under Massachusetts law, a residential tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is implied in leases and protects the tenant from substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises caused by the landlord or persons for whom the landlord is responsible. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant § 16.1 (1977) (covenant of quiet enjoyment); Javins v. First Nat. Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing tenant remedies for landlord’s breach of lease obligations and interference with habitability and enjoyment); see also Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (R.I. 1984) (discussing landlord responsibility for tenants’ habitability and enjoyment); cf. cases and authorities cited below.

20. A breach of the covenant occurs where the interference with use and enjoyment is substantial, permanent, or recurrent and is caused or allowed to continue by the landlord. See Restatement (Second) of Property §§ 16.1–16.2; Javins, supra. Massachusetts courts recognize that substantial interference can include ongoing noise that substantially interferes with sleep and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., cases construing landlord obligations and tenant remedies under MA law (authorities cited below).

21. Defendant’s knowledge of the disturbance (Plaintiff complained to him on five or six occasions and Defendant spoke once to the Upstairs Tenants) and his failure to take reasonable and timely steps to abate the ongoing, repeated noise constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s lease.

22. Defendant’s affirmative statement that he “can’t control how people live,” together with his failure to enforce lease provisions and take remedial action, demonstrates a refusal or inability to fulfill his landlord obligations to protect Plaintiff’s right to peaceful use and enjoyment.

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including medical expenses for sleep medication (approx. $40/month), the purchase of noise mitigation devices (earplugs, white noise machine), diminished sleep resulting in employment discipline, emotional distress, reduced quality of life, and other economic and non-economic losses.

24. Plaintiff has attempted to mitigate damages by requesting that Defendant enforce the lease and by taking personal measures (earplugs, white-noise machine, rearrangement), but Defendant’s failure to act has rendered those measures inadequate.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for personal injury, emotional distress, lost enjoyment of the premises, medical expenses (including prescription sleep medication), employment-related losses, and other economic harms — Plaintiff estimates total damages of approximately $5,000 based on incurred and reasonably anticipated losses, but reserves the right to prove the full extent of damages at trial;

B. For an award of costs and reasonable expenses incurred in bringing this action, including filing fees;

C. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;

D. For such injunctive relief as the Court deems necessary and proper (including an order requiring Defendant to take reasonable steps to abate the noise and enforce the lease against the Upstairs Tenants) to prevent further breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;

E. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

REQUEST FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
