While the Court does not adopt a rigid harm standard or fully equate parental rights with the best-interests test, it squarely discusses the need to respect fit parents\u2019 decisions when balancing against state and third-party claims based on children\u2019s best interests. Thus the case supports citing it for recognition of fundamental parental rights and the requirement that parental decisions be central in any best-interests analysis.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe liberty interest at issue in this case\u2014the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court. \u2026 In light of this extensive precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. \u2026 [I]f a fit parent's decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent's own determination.\u201d"
