COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1.   PARTIES
     1.1 Plaintiff Jessica Collins ("Plaintiff") is an individual and a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852.
     1.2 Defendant Linda Matthews ("Defendant") is an individual and the landlord/lessor of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the "Premises"). Defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

2.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE
     2.1 This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law because the claim arises under Massachusetts common law and state statutes and the Premises is located in Middlesex County.
     2.2 Venue is proper in Middlesex County and in Middlesex Superior Court because the Premises is located in Lowell, Middlesex County, and the causes of action arose therein.

3.   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
     3.1 On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy/lease for the Premises with Defendant and began renting the Premises. Plaintiff pays rent of $1,200.00 per month.
     3.2 The bathroom in the Premises has no window and relies on an exhaust fan for ventilation.
     3.3 In or about (onset reported to Defendant) [spring/summer 2024 — approximate time when mold first noticed] the Plaintiff discovered mold growth in the corner of the shower which has since spread to the bathroom ceiling.
     3.4 Plaintiff promptly reported the mold condition to Defendant. Defendant inspected the bathroom and, rather than undertaking remediation and correcting the deficient ventilation, blamed Plaintiff for the mold and stated that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and took showers that were “too hot and too long.” Defendant refused to remedy the ventilation problem and stated she would "clean the existing mold" but would not correct the ventilation because she asserted Plaintiff caused the problem.
     3.5 Plaintiff does run the bathroom exhaust fan while showering, although not necessarily 100% of the time, and takes hot showers that she believes are not unreasonably long compared to typical residential usage. The bathroom lacks any window or alternative means of adequate ventilation other than the fan.
     3.6 Since the appearance of the mold, Plaintiff has suffered new and ongoing respiratory problems including coughing, nasal congestion, and wheezing that she did not have prior to the mold’s appearance. Plaintiff sought medical care; her treating physician associated the respiratory symptoms with exposure to mold and recommended remediation and removal of the mold to protect Plaintiff’s health.
     3.7 As a result of the mold, Plaintiff discarded a shower curtain and several towels that became moldy at a cost of approximately $60.00.
     3.8 Defendant’s failure to provide or maintain adequate ventilation and to reasonably remediate the mold constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the Premises and has harmed Plaintiff physically, emotionally, and financially.
     3.9 Plaintiff estimates her damages from the interference and the Defendant’s breach at approximately $200.00 (inclusive of personal property loss, diminished benefit of the bargain, and other measurable economic harms), and in addition seeks any other compensatory damages proved at trial, costs, and attorney’s fees if applicable.

4.   GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES
     4.1 Under Massachusetts common law, a tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment of leased premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when the landlord's acts or failure to act substantially interfere with the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises or render the premises uninhabitable or unsafe.
     4.2 Massachusetts law and public health regulations impose obligations on landlords to provide and maintain residential premises in a condition fit for human habitation and to comply with the State Sanitary Code and local health regulations. See, e.g., M.G.L. c. 111; 105 C.M.R. (CMR) 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation); M.G.L. c. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes governing landlord obligations and tenant remedies).
     4.3 Courts across jurisdictions have long recognized that failures to remediate conditions such as mold, inadequate ventilation, and other defects that materially affect habitability and health can constitute breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and give rise to tenant damages and other remedies. See, e.g., Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071, 1076–78 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies); Park W. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979).
     4.4 Applicable authorities supporting the legal principles asserted herein include, without limitation:
          - Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111 (Public Health), including authorities to promulgate and enforce sanitary rules and obligations (see M.G.L. c. 111, §127A and related provisions);
          - 105 C.M.R. §410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation);
          - Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186 (Landlord and Tenant provisions);
          - Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970);
          - Park W. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mitchell, 47 N.Y.2d 316 (1979);
          - Hilder v. St. Peter, 478 A.2d 202 (Vt. 1984) (recognizing landlord obligations with respect to habitability) [recognizing that jurisdictions uniformly recognize obligations — cited for persuasive authority];
          - Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal. 3d 616 (1974) (discussing tenant remedies for uninhabitable premises) [persuasive authority];
          - Javins-related and habitability/quiet enjoyment decisions cited by Massachusetts courts and commentators (see, e.g., cases discussing landlord duty to maintain habitable premises and consequences of failure to repair conditions affecting health);
          - Local and Massachusetts case authority recognizing that indoor air quality hazards (including mold) and inadequate ventilation can constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment and habitability.
     4.5 Plaintiff relies on the foregoing statutes, regulations, and cases, and other controlling Massachusetts authority, as support for the claim that Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and to remediate a hazardous mold condition, together with Defendant’s refusal to correct inadequate ventilation, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5.   CAUSE OF ACTION
     COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts common law)
     5.1 Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1.1 through 4.5 as if fully set forth herein.
     5.2 At all times material hereto Plaintiff paid rent and otherwise performed her obligations under the tenancy.
     5.3 Defendant, as landlord and lessor, owed Plaintiff a duty to provide and maintain the Premises in a condition fit for human habitation and to refrain from acts or omissions that would substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.
     5.4 Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to remediate the mold hazard in the bathroom in a timely and effective manner and by refusing to correct or address inadequate ventilation (the sole mechanical means of ventilation for the bathroom), thereby causing a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to safely and peacefully occupy the Premises.
     5.5 Defendant’s breach caused injury to Plaintiff in the form of physical health impacts (new respiratory symptoms), damage to personal property (towels and a shower curtain in the approximate amount of $60.00), diminished use and enjoyment of the Premises, emotional distress, and monetary damages, all in an amount to be proven at trial but estimated presently at $200.00 and including additional compensatory damages.
     5.6 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has been damaged and is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

6.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF
     WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor against Defendant and grant the following relief:
     a.   A finding that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law by failing to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and by failing to remediate the mold and correct inadequate ventilation;
     b.   Compensatory damages to compensate Plaintiff for medical harms, property loss (including $60.00 for discarded personal property), diminished rental value and loss of use, and other economic harms in an amount to be proven at trial but presently estimated at no less than $200.00, together with additional compensatory damages as proved at trial;
     c.   Costs of suit and disbursements;
     d.   Pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;
     e.   Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including any equitable relief necessary to ensure that the Premises are made habitable and safe (including remediation and correction of ventilation), if Plaintiff elects to seek such equitable relief; and
     f.   Any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

7.   JURY DEMAND
     Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025
