Mark Thompson,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
(Residential Lease — Pro Se Plaintiff)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual and a resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103; (617) 555-0123; psm1433@gmail.com.
2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner/landlord of the residential premises at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (the “Premises”), and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.
3. Venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court because the Premises are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts and the acts and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in Hampden County.
4. This action is filed in Superior Court pursuant to the applicable Massachusetts statutes and procedural rules. Plaintiff seeks money damages, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. On or about May 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA (the “Lease”).
6. Under the Lease, Plaintiff pays monthly rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,400.00.
7. Beginning in approximately mid-October 2025 and continuing through the date of this Complaint, one of the two bedrooms in the apartment has had no electrical power. Specifically, the electrical outlets in that bedroom do not work and the overhead light fixture does not operate. The rest of the apartment remains powered and functional.
8. Plaintiff reported the loss of electricity in that bedroom to Defendant. Defendant arranged for an electrician to inspect the problem. The electrician informed Defendant and Plaintiff that the defect in that bedroom’s wiring was not a simple quick fix and would require more extensive repair work involving the building’s wiring.
9. Defendant informed Plaintiff that Defendant was obtaining repair quotes and that the repair was “complicated” because of the building’s old wiring. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested timely repair and restoration of electricity to the bedroom, but as of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has not completed the necessary repairs and the bedroom remains without electricity. The outage in that bedroom has now continued for approximately six (6) weeks.
10. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to timely and reasonably repair the electrical problem and restore the bedroom to use, Plaintiff has been unable to use the affected bedroom for its intended purpose. Plaintiff used the bedroom as a home office prior to the outage and, because of the outage, Plaintiff has been forced to work away from home at public locations and paid workspaces.
11. Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses and inconvenience due to Defendant’s failure to restore the bedroom to habitable and usable condition, including:
    a. expenses of approximately $15 per day for coffee and food at coffee shops and other public places (where Plaintiff worked during the outage);
    b. ongoing coworking space membership fees of $150 per month to secure a reliable workspace while the bedroom remained unusable;
    c. loss of quiet and comfortable use and enjoyment of the entire apartment because Plaintiff’s office equipment and materials have been crammed into the living room, significantly reducing the livability and privacy of the apartment.
12. Plaintiff estimates total compensable damages arising from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment to be approximately $1,200.00. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this amount to reflect actual, provable damages, including but not limited to daily expenses, coworking fees, and other consequential losses caused by Defendant’s breach.

COUNT I
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 12 above as if fully set forth herein.
14. At all times relevant hereto, the Lease between Plaintiff and Defendant included an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment (also commonly referred to as the covenant of habitability and quiet use), which is a covenant that the tenant shall be entitled to possess and use the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or those acting on the landlord’s behalf.
15. Defendant’s failure to timely and reasonably repair the electrical wiring defect that left one bedroom without electricity and useless for an extended period substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s possession and use of the Premises, including Plaintiff’s use of the bedroom as a home office and Plaintiff’s overall enjoyment of the apartment.
16. Defendant’s acts and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Defendant’s failure to provide timely and adequate repairs — despite notice and knowledge of the condition and the electrician’s assessment that the repair required significant work — is a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.
17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to out-of-pocket expenses for workspace and daily necessities, loss of use and enjoyment of the leased premises, inconvenience, and other consequential damages in an amount to be proven at trial, presently estimated at $1,200.00.
18. Plaintiff has performed all obligations placed upon Plaintiff by the Lease, including payment of rent, and has otherwise complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action.

LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is a foundational landlord-tenant principle in Massachusetts. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant statutes) and the Code of Massachusetts Regulations governing housing standards, including 105 CMR 410.000: Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation. The covenant is recognized and enforced by Massachusetts courts, and remedies for substantial interference include damages for loss of use, diminution in value, and consequential losses.
20. Plaintiff relies on, and preserves, all applicable statutory and common-law authorities concerning landlord obligations, quiet enjoyment, repairs, and tenant remedies, including but not limited to:
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant) (general landlord-tenant statutory framework);
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary process) (statutory procedures and tenant protections);
    - 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation);
    - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 (public health statutes governing local boards of health and housing complaints);
    - Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant §§ 12.1, 16.1 (implied covenants and remedies for breach);
    - Massachusetts caselaw recognizing and enforcing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and landlord responsibility to refrain from wrongful interference with tenant possession and use (authorities and cases concerning repairs, habitability, and substantial interference).
21. Plaintiff respectfully asserts that the authorities cited above support the claim that Defendant’s prolonged failure to remedy the electrical defect that rendered one bedroom unusable constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and entitles Plaintiff to money damages, costs, and other relief.

DAMAGES AND RELIEF SOUGHT
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief against Defendant:
A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, presently estimated at $1,200.00 for out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use, consequential damages, and diminution in enjoyment;
B. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;
C. Costs of suit and filing fees;
D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including any additional damages proven at trial; and
E. Trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Plaintiff demands a jury trial on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025
