                                                )

1.     Parties and Residence
1.1    Plaintiff: Emily Johnson (hereafter “Plaintiff” or “Mother”), whose contact telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com. Plaintiff is a resident of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

1.2    Defendant: Michael Smith (hereafter “Defendant” or “Father”), the other parent of the minor child named below. Defendant’s last known residence is in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2.     Jurisdiction and Background
2.1    This Court is the Probate and Family Court in and for Middlesex County and has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to Massachusetts law governing custody, parenting time, and modification of existing orders.

2.2    On March 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order concerning the parties’ minor child, Liam Smith (DOB: [approx. 2017]—currently age 8). The order awarded primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and parenting time to the Defendant consisting of three short visits during the week and Sunday afternoons, with no overnight parenting time for the Defendant.

3.     Child
3.1    The minor child who is the subject of this action is:
       - Liam Smith, age 8.

4.     Facts Supporting Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
4.1    At the time the March 15, 2018 order was entered, the parties’ child was three years old and the Defendant’s living situation was a material factor in limiting his parenting time: Defendant had only a room in a shared apartment with roommates and no separate, appropriate sleeping space for the child.

4.2    Since entry of the 2018 order, the following material changes in circumstances have occurred that affect the child’s welfare and the practicality of the current parenting schedule:

       a.    Defendant now has his own apartment and a separate bedroom for the child. This change in living circumstances was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the original order and directly addresses the Court’s prior concerns about overnight accommodations.

       b.    The child is now eight years old and is in full-time elementary school. As the child has aged, his developmental needs, social life, and school schedule have changed. He has expressed a clear, consistent desire to have overnight stays and “real sleepovers” at his father’s home.

       c.    The current parenting-time schedule (three short weekday visits plus Sunday afternoons, with no overnights) requires frequent shuttle-style transfers on school nights, creating logistical burdens, interrupting homework routines and bedtime schedules, and causing fatigue and stress for the child and both parents.

       d.    Both parents agree (and have communicated their agreement) that the existing schedule is no longer working well for the child’s school schedule, sleep, and homework routine and that a modification to allow appropriately scheduled overnight parenting time and a schedule more consistent with the child’s age and school responsibilities is needed.

4.3    These changes constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 order and directly bear on the best interests of the child.

5.     Legal Basis for Relief
5.1    Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting-time arrangements may be modified when there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and the modification is in the child’s best interests. The best-interests inquiry includes consideration of the child’s need for stability and routine, school schedule and educational needs, the parent-child relationship, the quality and safety of each parent’s home and parenting time, and the child’s own wishes as appropriate for the child’s age and maturity.

5.2    The factual allegations above demonstrate a material change (Father’s changed living situation; child’s age and school commitments; the disruption caused by short weekday transfers) that warrants modification to a parenting-time schedule that accommodates the child’s needs for consistent routines, adequate sleep, reduced disruptive transfers on school nights, and appropriate overnight parenting time with Father.

6.     Proposed Modification and Parenting Plan
6.1    Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the existing order to reflect the following proposed parenting-time schedule and related provisions intended to serve the best interests of the child:

       a.    Primary physical custody of Liam Smith shall remain with the Plaintiff (Mother).

       b.    Defendant (Father) shall be awarded regular parenting time including overnight stays as follows:
             i.    Alternate weekends: Father shall have parenting time every other weekend from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
            ii.    Midweek overnight: On alternating weeks when Father does not have the weekend overnight, Father shall have one midweek overnight from Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. to Thursday at 8:00 a.m. (or such alternative midweek overnight that the Court deems appropriate to minimize school disruption).
           iii.    Weekday visits: In addition to the midweek overnight plan, Father shall continue to have reasonable brief after-school or evening parenting time on two weekday evenings per week when school nights are not otherwise disrupted (e.g., 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.), subject to reasonable notice and coordination of school and homework obligations.

       c.    Pick-up and drop-off: To minimize disruption to the child’s school and bedtime routine, pick-up and drop-off shall occur at the child’s school, at the Plaintiff’s residence, or at another mutually agreed neutral location. Each parent shall coordinate transportation to minimize school-night transfers.

       d.    Holidays and school vacation: Parenting time during school vacations and holidays shall be modified consistent with the new pattern of overnights, with the parties to follow the Court’s customary holiday schedule or a schedule to be agreed upon by the parties and incorporated into the modified order.

       e.    Safety and conditions: Father shall maintain appropriate, safe housing for the child (including having the child’s own bed/bedroom), and the parties shall exchange contact information and promptly notify each other and the Court of any material change in address, phone number, or living circumstances.

6.2    Plaintiff proposes that the Court retain jurisdiction to enforce and, if necessary, further modify the custody and parenting-time provisions as the child’s needs evolve.

7.     Relief Requested
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

7.1    Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the March 15, 2018 custody order that affects the well-being of the minor child;

7.2    Modify the existing custody/parenting-time order to implement the proposed parenting-time schedule set forth above (or, in the alternative, such other parenting-time schedule as the Court finds in the best interests of the child), including allowance of appropriate overnight parenting time for the Defendant;

7.3    Order that pick-up/drop-off arrangements be structured to minimize school-night disruptions and preserve the child’s bedtime and homework routines;

7.4    Retain jurisdiction over the matter for purposes of enforcement and any future modification that may be warranted;

7.5    Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems fair and equitable in the best interests of the minor child, including costs and any such orders necessary to implement the modified schedule.

8.     Certification and Service
8.1    Plaintiff certifies that to the best of her knowledge, information, and belief, the foregoing statements are true and correct.

8.2    Plaintiff will serve a copy of this Complaint, together with any accompanying documents, on the Defendant at his last known address in accordance with the Court’s rules.

Date: December 1, 2025

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT LEGAL AUTHORITY AND CASE CITATIONS
I have prepared the foregoing as a pro se Complaint for Modification focused on the factual allegations showing a material change in circumstances and a proposed modification that would better serve the child’s needs. Because I am not acting as your attorney in this matter and I cannot reliably generate or verify specific statutory and reported-caselaw citations for filing, the Complaint does not include an exhaustive list of Massachusetts statutes and cases. Massachusetts law recognizes that custody/parenting-time orders may be modified when there is a material change in circumstances and when a modification is in the child’s best interests. If you would like, I can prepare a version of this Complaint that incorporates specific statutory citations and reported cases (and at least ten authorities) for filing; however, that would require legal research and verification to ensure accuracy, and I recommend you (a) allow me to proceed with that research and I will add verified citations, or (b) consult a local attorney or self-help center who can confirm and add the precise Massachusetts statutory and caselaw citations to the version you file with the Court.
