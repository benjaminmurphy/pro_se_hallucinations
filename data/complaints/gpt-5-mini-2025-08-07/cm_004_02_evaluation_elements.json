      "satisfied": true,
      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges factual changes since the 2018 order: Respondent now has his own apartment with a separate bedroom (\u00b63.2(a)); the child is older (3 \u2192 8) and attends school full time with different needs (\u00b63.2(b)); the current short-visit schedule causes disruption to school/homework and logistical strain (\u00b63.2(c)); and the parties agree a change is appropriate (\u00b63.2(d)). These facts tie to the circumstances underlying the original no-overnight restriction and are pleaded as substantial and material (\u00b63.3, Prayer \u00b67.1(a))."
