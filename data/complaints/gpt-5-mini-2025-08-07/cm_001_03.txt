Lisa Montgomery
    Plaintiff
v.                                                           Docket No. __________________

Mark Davis
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Children
   1.1 Plaintiff: Lisa Montgomery, phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2 Defendant: Mark Davis.
   1.3 Minor children subject to the existing order: Emma Montgomery, born 2017 (age 8); Noah Montgomery, born 2019 (age 6).

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court statutes and the existing custody order entered by this Court.
   2.2 Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the custodial parent (Plaintiff) resides in Bristol County and the original custody order in this matter (entered on May 15, 2020) was entered by this Court.

3. Procedural Background
   3.1 On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered an order establishing the parties’ parenting schedule, under which Plaintiff has primary custody of the children, and Defendant has parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week.
   3.2 The parties have followed that order since its entry until the material changes in circumstances described below.

4. Facts Giving Rise to Modification
   4.1 Since entry of the 2020 order, the circumstances of the parties have changed materially.
   4.2 Within the past several months (and continuing), Defendant accepted and now regularly works a night shift schedule from approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM on several nights per week.
   4.3 As a result of the night shift schedule, Defendant has on numerous occasions been unable to provide active, awake supervision to the children during the times he is scheduled to have overnight parenting time. The children have been left with Defendant’s roommate or returned to Plaintiff’s home with little or no prior notice because Defendant reports he is too tired after his shift.
   4.4 The children have reported to Plaintiff that they frequently observe Defendant napping after his shift and that they fall asleep on the couch in his home. Plaintiff has reasonable concerns about the children’s safety and welfare during periods when Defendant is fatigued from working a night shift and/or leaves the children in the care of an adult with whom Plaintiff has not been authorized to leave them.
   4.5 Defendant’s working schedule and his practice of leaving the children or dropping them off at Plaintiff’s residence at short notice constitute a substantial change in circumstances from the circumstances that existed when the 2020 parenting schedule was adopted.
   4.6 Plaintiff has attempted to address the matter informally with Defendant and to reach agreement on a revised schedule, but the parties have been unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.

5. Material Change in Circumstances; Best Interests of the Children
   5.1 Plaintiff alleges and avers that Defendant’s change in work schedule and the associated alterations in parenting time, supervision, and stability constitute a material change in circumstances since the 2020 order within the meaning of applicable Massachusetts law and jurisprudence.
   5.2 The requested modification is in the best interests of the children because it is reasonably calculated to ensure that:
       a) overnight parenting time occurs only when Defendant is actually off work, rested, and able to provide active parental supervision;
       b) the children are not placed in care of adults about whom Plaintiff has legitimate concerns without prior notice and agreement; and
       c) the children’s routine, stability, and safety are preserved.

6. Legal Basis for Relief (Statutes and Case Law)
   6.1 Plaintiff brings this Complaint pursuant to the authority of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and parenting orders where a material change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the children’s best interests. Applicable legal authority includes, among others:
       - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (statutes governing divorce, custody and related matters), including the Court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting arrangements;
       - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 39 (statutory obligations concerning protection of children and reporting);
       - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 and other provisions conferring jurisdiction and powers on the Probate and Family Court to issue orders for the care, custody and protection of minors.
   6.2 Applicable case law recognizes that modification of a custody order requires a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children and that the child’s best interests govern the modification determination. See, e.g.:
       - Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (recognizing parental rights and the best interest standard applied by courts);
       - Massachusetts cases and authorities establishing that custody and parenting-time modifications require a showing of material change and focus on the children’s best interests (courts routinely assess factors including stability, fitness, the child’s needs, parental work schedules and the practical ability of each parent to care for the child).
   6.3 Plaintiff will rely on the foregoing statutes and case law (and other Massachusetts appellate decisions and statutory authorities addressing custody modification and the best interests standard) as the legal foundation for the requested relief. Plaintiff requests that the Court consider the full body of relevant Massachusetts authority on custody modification, including decisions addressing material change, parental work schedules and children’s welfare when assessing this Complaint.

7. Relief Requested
   Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   7.1 Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the Court’s May 15, 2020 custody order sufficient to warrant consideration of modification.
   7.2 Modify the existing parenting schedule to provide that:
       a) Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when Defendant is actually off work and otherwise able to provide active parental supervision and care for the children (i.e., Defendant must confirm that he is off work prior to taking overnight parenting time);
       b) For predictable weekly scheduling, Defendant’s alternate-weekend parenting time may continue as presently structured when those weekends do not conflict with his work shifts, provided that Defendant gives at least 48 hours’ notice if his work schedule necessitates a change and confirmed replacement parenting arrangements acceptable to Plaintiff have been arranged;
       c) The previously authorized weekday overnight shall be suspended or converted to daytime parenting time except on nights when Defendant is confirmed to be off work and able to supervise the children responsibly;
       d) If Defendant is off work but will rely on an adult other than Plaintiff to supervise the children while Defendant naps or rests, Defendant shall provide Plaintiff with prior written notice of the name, address and contact information of the caregiver and provide evidence of the caregiver’s suitability (criminal background check or other mutual agreed verification) at least 72 hours in advance of leaving the children in that person’s care;
       e) In the absence of Defendant’s prior confirmation that he is off work and able to provide safe, awake supervision, Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall not occur and shall be made up at a mutually agreeable time or as ordered by the Court;
   7.3 Enter any temporary or interim orders necessary to protect the children’s safety and stability pending final resolution of this Complaint, including, if the Court deems appropriate, temporary suspension of unsupervised overnights when Defendant is scheduled to work a night shift and/or imposition of supervised parenting time until Defendant demonstrates consistent availability for safe overnight parenting;
   7.4 Require the parties to participate in parenting coordination or mediation to develop a predictable, written parenting plan that attends to work schedules, notification obligations, and contingency procedures when Defendant’s work interferes with scheduled parenting time;
   7.5 Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to effectuate the children’s best interests, including costs and fees where appropriate.

8. Verification and Prayer for Relief
   8.1 Plaintiff verifies under the pains and penalties of perjury under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that the facts set forth above are true and correct to the best of her knowledge, information, and belief.
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
   a) Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the May 15, 2020 order;
   b) Modify the existing custody/parenting-time arrangement in accordance with the relief requested in Paragraph 7 above;
   c) Issue any temporary or emergency orders necessary to protect the children pending final hearing; and
   d) Grant any further relief the Court deems equitable and proper.

Date: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
