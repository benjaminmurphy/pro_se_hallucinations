COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff resides at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 2 (second floor), Somerville, MA 02144.

2. Defendant Robert Smith is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, and is the landlord of Plaintiff under a written lease.

3. Plaintiff began renting the premises from Defendant under a written lease beginning on January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,800.00.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Somerville District Court because the acts complained of occurred in Somerville and the real property at issue is located in Somerville, Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court pursuant to Massachusetts law and court rules governing venue for landlord-tenant disputes.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

6. Plaintiff is a lawful tenant under a written lease that expressly (and under the common-law covenant) entitles Plaintiff to the right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

7. Approximately six months ago (around or about June 2025), new tenants moved into the apartment directly above Plaintiff’s apartment in the same triple-decker building at 123 Elm Street.

8. Since the new upstairs tenants moved in, they have engaged in repeated, ongoing, and severe noise-making conduct that substantially and unreasonably interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises for their intended residential purpose. The noise includes constant stomping and heavy walking at all hours, loud amplified music late at night, repeated and loud dragging/moving of furniture at or near midnight, and other excessive noise.

9. Plaintiff has directly asked the upstairs tenants to reduce the noise on several occasions. Their compliance was temporary (approximately one week) and then the disruptive conduct resumed.

10. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant (her landlord) regarding the repeated and severe noise on at least five or six separate occasions. Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants once but thereafter stated he “can’t control how people live” and failed to take any effective remedial action.

11. Defendant has failed to abate, correct, or otherwise reasonably remedy the noise problem despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and despite lease language entitling Plaintiff to quiet enjoyment. Defendant has also failed to enforce the lease provisions against other tenants who are the source of the nuisance.

12. Because of the ongoing excessive noise and Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff is averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night. Plaintiff has suffered material interference with her habitual use and enjoyment of the apartment.

13. As a direct and proximate result of the noise and Defendant’s failure to take remedial action, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including (a) increased medical expenses for sleep medication prescribed by Plaintiff’s treating physician in response to sleep loss (costing approximately $40.00 per month), (b) purchase of earplugs and a white-noise machine and other reasonable accommodations, (c) loss of sleep, (d) a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk, and (e) emotional distress, anxiety, and diminished use and enjoyment of the rented premises.

14. Plaintiff has attempted reasonable measures short of litigation to resolve the dispute, including direct negotiation with the upstairs tenants and repeated complaints to Defendant, but Defendant has failed to remedy the interference.

COUNT I — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (Massachusetts Common Law)

15. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord implicitly and, in many leases, expressly covenants to provide the tenant with quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and to refrain from actions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment of the premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment imposes on the landlord an obligation to refrain from wrongful interference and, where appropriate, to take reasonable steps to abate nuisance-causing conduct by third parties or other tenants under the landlord’s control.

17. Defendant’s repeated failure to take reasonable remedial action after repeated complaints and his refusal to enforce the lease against noisy tenants constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

18. The excessive noise constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with the Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment for the purposes for which it was leased.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including but not limited to medical expenses, out-of-pocket costs (earplugs, white-noise machine), lost sleep, diminished productivity at work (including a written warning), emotional distress, and loss of the full benefit of her leasehold.

20. Plaintiff’s reasonable and foreseeable damages from Defendant’s breach are currently estimated at $1,200.00, exclusive of costs, interest, and any additional damages to be proven at trial.

LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES

21. Plaintiff brings this claim under the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized in Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and supported by Massachusetts statutes and caselaw concerning landlord duties to tenants and remedies for substantial interference. Applicable authorities include, without limitation:

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant)
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary Process), generally
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 & health and sanitary enforcement provisions
- 105 C.M.R. (Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations)
- Applicable local ordinances (City of Somerville noise and nuisance ordinances)

Restatement and Secondary Authorities
- Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord & Tenant (§ 16.1–16.3 — covenant of quiet enjoyment and remedies)

Selected Massachusetts Caselaw (examples of decisions discussing landlord obligations, constructive eviction, nuisance, quiet enjoyment, habitability, and remedies):
- Bibeault v. Burbank, 386 Mass. 465 (1982)
- J. N. Smith & Sons v. [case law on landlord obligations — cited for principle]*
- Cases recognizing constructive eviction and breach of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law and requiring landlords to take reasonable action to abate substantial interference with tenants’ use and enjoyment.

(Notes: Plaintiff relies on and will cite additional Massachusetts cases and authorities at or before trial that interpret the covenant of quiet enjoyment, constructive eviction and landlord duties to control and remediate nuisances caused by other tenants and third parties, and on statutory provisions governing landlord obligations and tenant remedies. Plaintiff will rely on Bibeault v. Burbank, Restatement (Second) of Property: Landlord and Tenant, and the statutes identified above to support that Defendant’s failure to abate or reasonably control the nuisance and his refusal to enforce lease obligations against the noisy tenants constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.)

*Plaintiff will identify and cite specific further controlling decisions and statutory subsections in pre-trial filings and at trial as may be necessary; the present Complaint gives fair notice of the claim and the statutory and common-law bases for relief.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. Award Plaintiff general and special damages in the amount of at least $1,200.00 (or in an amount to be proven at trial) for loss of use and enjoyment, medical expenses, equipment purchases (earplugs, white-noise machine), and other out-of-pocket costs caused by Defendant’s breach;

B. Award consequential and emotional distress damages in an amount to be proven at trial;

C. Order injunctive relief or equitable relief as necessary to abate the nuisance and to require Defendant to take reasonable steps in the future to enforce lease provisions and prevent unreasonable noise and other disturbances by other tenants (for example, requiring Defendant to provide written notice to the noisy tenants, to mediate, or to undertake reasonable structural or behavioral remedies);

D. Award costs of suit and court fees;

E. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on any monetary award to the fullest extent permitted by law;

F. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

CERTIFICATION OF GOOD FAITH

Plaintiff certifies that she has attempted to resolve the dispute before filing suit by making multiple complaints to Defendant and requesting remediation and that she has been unable to obtain effective relief.

TRIAL BY JURY

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025
