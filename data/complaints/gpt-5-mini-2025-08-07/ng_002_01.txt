COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and alleges against the Defendant, Mark Thompson, as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") is an adult resident of Newton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is an adult resident of Massachusetts who at all times relevant to this complaint owned, possessed, controlled, or exercised care and custody of a large dog that Defendant allowed to run loose in Newton Park.

3. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court under the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and Massachusetts law because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts (Newton Park, 123 Maple Street, Newton, MA).

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action because the amount sought and the nature of the claim fall within the jurisdiction of the Newton District Court.

5. This action is timely under the statute of limitations for personal injury claims. The incident occurred on May 15, 2023. This complaint is filed within three years of that date pursuant to M.G.L. c. 260, § 2A.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 15, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a paved public path at Newton Park, 123 Maple Street, Newton, Massachusetts.

7. Newton Park has posted signage requiring that all dogs be on leashes.

8. Defendant owns a large dog who Defendant routinely allows to run loose in the park despite the posted leash requirement.

9. On May 15, 2023, Defendant had the dog off-leash. At the time of the incident, Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet from the path, talking with others and holding a leash over his shoulder but not attached to the dog.

10. The dog suddenly charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and aggressively. The dog made no contact with Plaintiff.

11. Fearing that the dog would attack or bite her, and reasonably believing that Defendant’s dog posed an imminent threat, Plaintiff swerved off the path to avoid the dog.

12. When Plaintiff swerved off the path she tripped over an exposed tree root and fell down a small embankment. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist.

13. Several other joggers and park users witnessed the event, including the dog’s unrestrained approach, Plaintiff’s attempt to avoid the dog, and Plaintiff’s resulting fall.

14. Defendant finally called the dog back only after Plaintiff had already fallen. The dog did not bite or otherwise touch Plaintiff.

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income, and other damages.

16. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment at a local hospital emergency room on May 15, 2023. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a fractured wrist, required immobilization with a brace and/or splint, required follow-up medical care, and incurred medical bills of approximately $3,500. Plaintiff missed work and lost approximately $1,200 in earnings, and missed a musical recital for which she was preparing.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as other users of Newton Park, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, control, and supervision of his dog so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others using the park. This duty included the obligation to keep the dog leashed in accordance with the park’s posted rules and ordinary care to prevent the dog from charging or otherwise endangering lawful park users.

19. Defendant breached that duty by allowing the dog to run loose and by failing to restrain or control the dog despite the presence of posted leash requirements and the foreseeable risk that an unrestrained large dog would approach, charge, or frighten park users.

20. Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Defendant’s negligent failure to keep the dog under control and on a leash created a foreseeable risk that Plaintiff (and other park users) would need to take evasive action to avoid the dog, and that such evasive action could result in injury — which it did in the form of Plaintiff’s fall and fractured wrist.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses (approximately $3,500), lost wages (approximately $1,200), emotional distress, and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial for medical expenses, lost wages, and other economic losses;

B. For general damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic losses;

C. For interest allowed by law from the date of injury;

D. For costs of suit, including filing fees, process service, and reasonable expenses;

E. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

PLAINTIFF HEREBY DEMANDS A TRIAL BY JURY ON ALL ISSUES SO TRIABLE.
