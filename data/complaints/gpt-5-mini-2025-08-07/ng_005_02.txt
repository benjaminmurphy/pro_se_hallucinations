COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1.     Parties

1.1    Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff" or "Turner") is an individual and resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

1.2    Defendant Michael Adams ("Defendant" or "Adams") is an individual who resides in Springfield, Massachusetts and who at all times relevant to this Complaint owned, controlled, maintained, and/or had dominion over the ladder described below and the portion of the driveway and fence adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

2.     Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in Hampden Superior Court because the motor vehicle property damage and the acts and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2.2    The applicable statute of limitations for tort claims in Massachusetts is set forth at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A; Plaintiff brings this action within the applicable limitations period.

3.     Statement of Facts (General and Specific Allegations)

3.1    At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff resided at a duplex located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, and shared a common driveway with Defendant, who resided in the adjoining unit.

3.2    Defendant owned and maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder. Defendant repeatedly stored the ladder by leaning it against the wooden fence that runs alongside the shared driveway, immediately adjacent to the area where Plaintiff customarily parked and backed into her vehicle.

3.3    On more than one occasion before the incident described below, Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant that the ladder, when left leaning against the fence, could fall onto her vehicle, particularly on windy days. Plaintiff asked Defendant to secure or move the ladder. Defendant stated that he would either tie it down or move it but repeatedly failed to do so.

3.4    On or about March 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was backing into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street, a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to topple from its position against the fence and fall directly onto the front of Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking the hood and windshield.

3.5    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to secure or remove the ladder, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained a dented hood and a cracked windshield. While the vehicle remained operable, Plaintiff was required to obtain bodywork repairs and replacement of the windshield, pay an insurance deductible, and rent a replacement vehicle while her vehicle was in the shop for over one week.

3.6    Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses for vehicle repair-related costs, insurance deductible payments, and rental vehicle costs. Plaintiff’s medical expenses and lost wages are approximately $0.

3.7    Defendant at all times relevant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to others, including property damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, by safely storing, securing, or otherwise preventing an unsecured ladder from creating an unreasonable risk of harm.

4.     Causes of Action

Count I — Negligence

4.1    Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1.1 through 3.7 as if fully set forth herein.

4.2    Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. See Brown v. Kendall, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 292 (1850) (establishing that a person must use ordinary care to avoid harming others); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282 (defining negligence).

4.3    Defendant breached that duty by (a) negligently leaving a tall, unsecured ladder leaned against the shared fence immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area; (b) failing to secure, tie down, move, or otherwise take reasonable measures to prevent the ladder from falling; and (c) failing to respond adequately to Plaintiff’s repeated warnings and requests that the ladder be moved or secured.

4.4    Defendant’s conduct was negligent under the circumstances and created an unreasonable risk of foreseeable harm. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302B (liability for negligent acts by one who entrusts or places an instrumentality where it creates danger to others); Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 31 (5th ed.) (discussing duty and breach).

4.5    Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of the ladder falling and of the resulting damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928) (proximate cause and foreseeability principles); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 430-433 (causation and scope of liability).

4.6    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage to her vehicle, incurred repair costs and insurance deductible payments, and incurred rental vehicle expenses while her vehicle was repaired.

4.7    Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to: vehicle repair costs (including replacement windshield and bodywork), the insurance deductible paid by Plaintiff, rental vehicle costs, interest, and costs of suit. Plaintiff seeks recovery of all compensable damages permitted by law.
