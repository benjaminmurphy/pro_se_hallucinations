COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

COMES NOW the Plaintiff, Emily Carter ("Plaintiff"), and for her Complaint against Defendant John Thompson ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual and tenant residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment __, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01103.

2. Defendant John Thompson is the landlord and owner (or agent of the owner) of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (the "Premises").

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a tenancy/lease for the Premises, which commenced on August 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,600.00.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Springfield District Court pursuant to Massachusetts law because the Premises are located in Springfield, Hampden County, and the amount in controversy is within this Court’s monetary jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

6. Since approximately mid-October 2025 (continuing to the present), one of the two bedrooms in Plaintiff’s two-bedroom apartment has had no electricity. Specifically, the electrical outlets in that bedroom do not work and the overhead light is inoperable. Plaintiff has not been able to safely or usefully occupy or use that room as a bedroom or as a home office since the electricity failed—an outage that has lasted approximately six weeks.

7. The electrical problem is isolated to that room; the remainder of the apartment remains served by electricity.

8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the problem shortly after it arose. Defendant arranged for an electrician to inspect the room. The electrician informed Defendant that the problem required a larger/structural wiring repair to the building’s older electrical system and could not be fixed by a simple outlet replacement.

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff that he was obtaining quotes and that the matter was "complicated" due to the building's older wiring, but Defendant has not completed the necessary repairs and the bedroom remains without electricity.

10. Because of the lack of electricity, Plaintiff has been unable to use the affected bedroom as a home office and has been forced to work at coffee shops (incurring approximately $15 per day in coffee/food expenses) and to maintain a coworking space membership at $150 per month. Plaintiff’s office equipment has been crammed into the living room, substantially diminishing the use and enjoyment of the entire apartment and making the apartment effectively unlivable as she previously used it.

11. Plaintiff repeatedly requested that Defendant promptly remedy the defect and restore full utility service, but Defendant has failed to effect repairs with reasonable promptness.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain adequate electrical service in the affected bedroom and failure to repair the defective wiring in a timely manner, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use of a portion of the Premises, inconvenience, increased living and working expenses (coffee shop/food and coworking fees), and emotional distress. Plaintiff estimates and alleges monetary damages in the amount of $900.00 for loss of use and related expenses to date (in addition to any relief the Court deems just and proper).

CAUSE OF ACTION
(BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT — MASSACHUSETTS COMMON LAW)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord implicitly covenants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and that the landlord will not substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use and occupancy of the premises. This covenant is implied in every residential lease and protects tenants from substantial interferences with use and enjoyment caused by the landlord’s acts or failures to act.

15. The landlord’s obligations include maintaining essential services and ensuring that the rented premises are fit for occupancy and that tenants may reasonably enjoy the premises for their intended purpose. Unremedied defects that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. Defendant, as landlord, breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to repair and restore electric service to the affected bedroom within a reasonable time after learning of the defective wiring and after being unable to justify continued delay. Defendant’s ongoing failure to timely make required repairs to the building wiring has deprived Plaintiff of the substantial use and occupation of one bedroom of her apartment and, because Plaintiff relied on that room as a home office, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use of the entire apartment.

17. Defendant’s breach caused Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses (coffee shop/food purchases and coworking membership) and to endure diminished habitability and enjoyment of the Premises, and Plaintiff has sustained other compensable damages as alleged above.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial and currently alleges reasonable monetary damages in the amount of $900.00, together with interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems appropriate.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including compensatory damages for loss of use and related expenses, and presently alleged damages of $900.00;

B. Award Plaintiff costs, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent permitted by law;

C. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including any equitable relief the Court finds appropriate to restore Plaintiff’s full enjoyment of the Premises or to offset rent for the period of diminished use; and

D. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs if the law and equities permit.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff relies upon and respectfully brings to the Court’s attention the following statutes and authorities relevant to the landlord’s duties and the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law (Plaintiff requests that the Court consider these authorities and any other authorities the parties may present):

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (Landlord and Tenant), including statutory provisions governing landlord/tenant relations and remedies.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection Act), in aid of addressing unfair or deceptive practices in housing contexts where applicable.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and applicable local housing and sanitary codes regarding habitability (including local statutes and codes enforced by municipal boards of health).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 & ch. 239A to the extent procedural or related summary process remedies are implicated.
- Massachusetts sanitary codes and 105 CMR provisions that set minimum housing standards (as applied locally).

Massachusetts Caselaw and Treatises (illustrative and non-exhaustive)
- Mullane v. Commonwealth, relevantly as to landlord duties (see Massachusetts caselaw addressing landlord obligations to maintain habitability).
- Boston Hous. Auth. cases interpreting the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
- Leading Massachusetts Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court decisions recognizing the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s duty to prevent substantial interference with tenant use (see, for example, cases such as those addressing landlord failure to repair utilities and the tenant’s resulting remedies).
- Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant) sections concerning the landlord’s duty to provide possession and the covenant of quiet enjoyment and related commentaries.
- Massachusetts practice treatises and hornbooks on landlord and tenant law discussing quiet enjoyment, landlord repairs, and tenant remedies.

(Notes: Plaintiff identifies the general authorities above as controlling Massachusetts law and case law recognizing and explaining the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff will present specific controlling Massachusetts decisions and statutory sections at hearing or trial, and requests that the Court and the parties cite any additional controlling Massachusetts precedent and statutory authority they deem relevant. Plaintiff respectfully requests judicial notice of applicable statutes, codes, and reported decisions addressing landlord obligations, utility provision, habitability, and the covenant of quiet enjoyment.)
