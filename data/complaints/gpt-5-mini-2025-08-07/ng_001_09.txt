Fresh Market Grocery,
     Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by and through her pro se filing, complains against Defendant Fresh Market Grocery ("Defendant") and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Fresh Market Grocery is a retail grocery business that, upon information and belief, operates the grocery store located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the "Premises").

3. The incident giving rise to this action occurred on September 16, 2023 on the Premises located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 213, § 1 and the general jurisdiction of the Middlesex Superior Court over tort claims occurring within Middlesex County.

5. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 3 because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Middlesex County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On Saturday afternoon, September 16, 2023, Plaintiff entered Defendant's grocery store located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, MA for the purpose of shopping as an invitee.

7. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk and slipped and fell, landing hard on her hip.

8. The spilled milk was not a small isolated area; cart tracks were visible through the spill, indicating a sizable and traversable hazard in the shopping aisle.

9. There were no warning signs, cones, wet floor signs, barricades, or other visible warnings placed by Defendant or its employees to alert customers to the hazard.

10. An employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away at the time of the incident. After Plaintiff fell and the employee approached, the employee admitted he had noticed the spill "a few minutes ago" but was "finishing up" his task before he got the mop.

11. As a direct result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a hip sprain. Plaintiff sought medical treatment at urgent care the next day (September 17, 2023) and was diagnosed with a hip sprain, for which Plaintiff later required and received a course of physical therapy.

12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses related to treatment of the hip injury, and suffered lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to missing several shifts at her employment at a café while recovering from the injury.

13. Plaintiff has experienced pain, suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and a loss of the enjoyment of life, all in amounts to be proven at trial.

14. All the foregoing acts and omissions of Defendant occurred without any negligence on the part of Plaintiff that contributed to the occurrence.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of care to invitees, including Plaintiff, to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn of latent hazards of which Defendant knew or should have known, and to exercise reasonable care in preventing injurious conditions from occurring (see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; Massachusetts Civil Jury Instruction — Negligence; and related Massachusetts case law interpreting the duty owed to invitees).

17. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the spilled milk on the dairy aisle floor. The size of the spill and the presence of cart tracks through it were sufficient to put Defendant on constructive notice of the hazardous condition.

18. Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:
    a. failing to discover or clean up the spilled milk in a timely manner;
    b. failing to place adequate warnings (e.g., wet floor signs or cones) around the spill or to otherwise warn customers of the hazardous condition;
    c. allowing an employee to delay addressing a known hazardous condition while customers were present; and
    d. otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustaining physical injury (hip sprain), incurring medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other damages.

20. Plaintiff has satisfied any and all conditions precedent to the maintenance of this action, including statutory notice requirements and the running of any applicable periods, or such conditions are excused, tolled, or otherwise inapplicable.
