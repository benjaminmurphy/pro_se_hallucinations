COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Robert Thompson ("Defendant"), states as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Robert Thompson is, upon information and belief, the owner and occupant of the residence located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Berkshire Superior Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (Berkshire County). See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1 (venue and courts).

4. The claim asserted in this complaint arises out of injuries sustained on or about August 15, 2023, at or near 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. This action is timely under the Massachusetts statute of limitations for personal injury actions. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (three-year limitation for personal injury).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately [time not required for pleading], Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk along Maple Street in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, carrying grocery bags.

6. A large maple tree standing on Defendant’s property had, for a substantial period prior to the incident, exhibited one major limb/branch that was visibly cracked, drooping, and otherwise in a deteriorated, unstable condition.

7. Plaintiff personally observed the cracked, drooping branch on more than one occasion before August 15, 2023. Neighbors also observed the condition and informed Defendant of the cracked branch. Defendant acknowledged those concerns and told neighbors that he would "deal with it in the spring," but did not take action to inspect, secure, prune, or remove the dangerous branch prior to August 15, 2023.

8. During an ordinary summer thunderstorm on August 15, 2023 (a routine storm with no extraordinary weather warnings), the visibly cracked branch suddenly and without warning snapped and fell onto the sidewalk where Plaintiff was walking, striking Plaintiff on the shoulder and back and knocking Plaintiff to the ground.

9. As a direct and proximate result of the falling branch, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises. Plaintiff sought and received medical treatment for these injuries, incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses, and lost approximately $500 in wages from missing about one week of work at her retail job.

10. The falling branch and Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by, and directly attributable to, Defendant’s negligent failure to exercise reasonable care in the inspection, maintenance, and/or abatement of a dangerous condition (the cracked branch) on Defendant’s property that presented an unreasonable risk of harm to pedestrians lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

11. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth herein.

12. At all times relevant, Defendant owed a duty to persons lawfully on and using the public sidewalk adjacent to his property to exercise reasonable care to prevent conditions on his property—such as unstable, cracked tree limbs—that create an unreasonable risk of harm to foreseeable users of the sidewalk. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (duties regarding dangerous conditions on land); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (duty to protect persons on premises), and recognized Massachusetts law imposing a duty of reasonable care by landowners toward foreseeable persons exposed to hazards created by the landowner’s property.

13. Defendant breached that duty by negligently failing to inspect, secure, prune, remove, or otherwise reasonably abate the dangerous cracked tree branch of which Defendant had actual notice (or which a reasonably careful owner in Defendant’s circumstances would have discovered and corrected).

14. Defendant’s breach proximately caused the branch to fall onto the public sidewalk and strike Plaintiff, causing the injuries and losses described above.

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and continues to sustain economic damages (medical expenses, lost wages) and non-economic damages (pain, suffering, disability, and emotional distress) in amounts to be proven at trial, including medical expenses of approximately $2,500 and lost earnings of approximately $500.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial for Plaintiff’s past and future medical expenses, lost earnings, lost earning capacity (if any), pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other noneconomic losses;

B. For costs and interest allowed by law;

C. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
