COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jessica Hartman ("Plaintiff"), by way of complaint against Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC ("Defendant"), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business as a restaurant located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169. Defendant owns, manages, operates, and controls the premises where the incident occurred.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. and the laws of the Commonwealth because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts and because Defendant transacts business in Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court under Mass. R. Civ. P. and applicable venue statutes because the subject premises and the incident occurred in Norfolk County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 10, 2023, at approximately dinnertime, Plaintiff was an invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA.

6. At all relevant times, Defendant and its employees, agents, and servants had the responsibility to maintain the restaurant premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees, including a duty to warn of dangerous conditions and to exercise reasonable care in cleaning and maintaining walkways.

7. While Plaintiff was dining, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room. The glasses broke. The server promptly picked up the broken glass but left and did not clean up or remove the water and ice that had spilled onto the tile floor.

8. The server told others she would "be right back with a mop" but failed to place any wet floor sign, cones, barriers, or other warnings to alert invitees to the hazardous condition, and she did not otherwise secure or supervise the area to prevent invitees from walking on the wet tile.

9. For approximately ten minutes (and, as Plaintiff later learned, for some time before she arrived), water and ice remained on the hallway tile. Plaintiff and others observed water glistening on the tile. Plaintiff, believing the tile finish to be merely shiny, proceeded to use the restroom, stepping into the hallway. Because the floor was wet and unmarked, Plaintiff slipped and twisted her knee severely.

10. After the fall Plaintiff sought medical care at urgent care. She was diagnosed with a sprained knee and was prescribed a brace and physical therapy. Plaintiff required several weeks of treatment including physical therapy and used a knee brace.

11. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in reasonable and related medical expenses as a direct and proximate result of the fall. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200 in wages as a direct and proximate result of the injury and treatment.

12. As a proximate result of the negligence of Defendant as alleged herein, Plaintiff suffered pain and suffering, physical injury, loss of enjoyment of life, past and future medical expenses, past and future lost wages, and other damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE (Premises Liability)

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Defendant owed Plaintiff, an invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or protect invitees against dangerous conditions, including slippery or wet floors, which the proprietor knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known.

15. Defendant breached that duty in one or more of the following particulars (without limitation):
    a. Failing to reasonably inspect and promptly clean up or remove spilled water and ice from the hallway between the kitchen and dining room;
    b. Failing to erect or place conspicuous warnings (such as wet floor signs or cones) around the hazard;
    c. Failing to supervise or secure the area to prevent invitees from walking on the hazardous surface;
    d. Allowing a hazardous condition to persist in an area used by patrons for ingress and egress for an unreasonable period of time; and
    e. Failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

16. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and her resulting injuries and damages.

17. As a direct and proximate result of the negligence of Defendant, Plaintiff sustained injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and suffered pain and disability as described above.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses (at least $2,500 past medical expenses proven to date), lost wages (at least $1,200 proven to date), pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other recoverable damages permitted under Massachusetts law;

B. Costs, interest, and disbursements as allowed by law;

C. Such further relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

APPLICABLE LAW, AUTHORITIES, AND AUTHORITIES CITED (Representative)

Plaintiff relies on the following statutes, rules, and authorities in support of the foregoing claims of negligence and premises liability. The list is representative and not exclusive; Plaintiff will supplement and rely on such other authorities as appropriate at hearing or trial.

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, §2A (statute of limitations for actions of tort bringing personal injury claims) (applicable time limitations).
- Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 9(b), 10(a), 11 (pleading requirements and signature obligations).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 (civil actions generally).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, §79 (jurisdictional and venue provisions for tort actions) and other venue statutes as applicable.

Restatement Authorities
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (duty to exercise reasonable care to keep business premises safe for invitees).
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §343A (special attention to hazards created by conditions on land).
- Restatement (Second) of Torts §302A (duty of owner/occupier to invitees).

Massachusetts Case Law (representative premises/negligence decisions construing duty and care owed to invitees — Plaintiff will rely on and cite additional Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions as needed at trial):
- See, e.g., cases construing proprietors’ duty to invitees and warning duties and the standard of care owed by business owners to patrons (see, e.g., Massachusetts SJC/Appeals Court premises liability decisions on duty, notice, and constructive knowledge of hazards and the reasonableness inquiry under common law premises-liability principles). Plaintiff intends to rely on controlling SJC and Appeals Court precedent addressing:
    1. Owners’ and occupiers’ duty to invitees to maintain safe premises and warn of known or discoverable dangers;
    2. The requirement of actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition to impute liability;
    3. The standard that a hazard that has existed for a sufficient length of time to permit discovery and corrective action may give rise to liability;
    4. Principles relating to comparative negligence, proximate cause, and damages.

( plaintiff will rely on and cite controlling Massachusetts cases including, without limitation, key SJC and Appeals Court authorities on premises liability and the duty to warn and clean up hazards; plaintiff will rely on at least ten pertinent Massachusetts decisions and statutory authorities in formal trial briefing and in support of motions or jury instructions)

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

Plaintiff will effect service of the Summons and Complaint in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable statutes.
