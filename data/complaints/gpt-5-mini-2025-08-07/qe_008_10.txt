Mark Thompson,                                 Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1.     Parties

1.1    Plaintiff Jessica Brown ("Plaintiff") is an individual and tenant residing at 123 Main St, Apartment __, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

1.2    Defendant Mark Thompson ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 123 Main St, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, and is the person to whom Plaintiff pays rent.

2.     Jurisdiction and Venue

2.1    This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts because the dispute concerns the breach of landlord obligations under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and arises out of a tenancy in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

2.2    Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court because the premises that are the subject of this action are located in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

3.     Nature of the Action

3.1    This is an action by a residential tenant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law resulting from the landlord’s failure to repair and secure the building’s main entry door (a common-area door), which has allowed unauthorized access to the building, theft of tenant property from the common hallway, and evidence of unauthorized persons sleeping in the basement. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered loss of property, anxiety and inconvenience, and incurred out-of-pocket expenses for additional security.

4.     Facts

4.1    Plaintiff entered into a tenancy at 123 Main St, Chelsea, MA on or about June 1, 2022, and pays Defendant monthly rent in the amount of $1,500.00.

4.2    At all relevant times, Defendant was the landlord and had responsibility for the maintenance, repair, and security of common areas of the building, including the main entry door and the basement.

4.3    For at least two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant that the main entry door to the building had a broken lock and did not latch properly. Plaintiff first informed Defendant of the broken lock approximately two months ago. Defendant stated that he would repair the door but failed to do so.

4.4    Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the broken lock on at least two additional occasions. Defendant made no effective repairs and dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns as being an overreaction, asserting that the neighborhood is safe.

4.5    Last month, because of the defective door, an unknown person entered the building and went through tenants’ mail and packages in the hallway. Several tenants, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the common hallway as a direct result of unauthorized access. Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately $120.00, was stolen.

4.6    Plaintiff has also discovered evidence indicating that someone has been sleeping in the building’s basement. The presence of unauthorized persons in the building’s basement and unauthorized entry into the building have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment and have caused fear, insecurity, and distress.

4.7    Because Defendant did not repair the main entry door and did not take reasonable steps to secure the building or otherwise protect tenants from foreseeable criminal intrusion, Plaintiff has been forced to incur expenses to protect her person and property. Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera outside her apartment door and purchased a better deadbolt for her apartment door. Those out-of-pocket costs totaled approximately $200.00.

4.8    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and failure to act, Plaintiff has suffered economic loss (value of stolen package and security expenses), loss of the benefit of quiet enjoyment of the rented premises, emotional distress, and other damages.

5.     Cause of Action
       (Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Law)

5.1    Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

5.2    Under Massachusetts law, every tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, i.e., the right to possession and peaceful use of the premises without substantial interference caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions or conduct of third parties where the landlord’s wrongful conduct or negligence substantially causes or permits the interference. The covenant protects tenants against substantial and unreasonable interference with their use and enjoyment of the premises.

5.3    Defendant, as landlord, had the duty to keep common areas and building locks in a reasonable state of repair and to exercise reasonable care to protect tenants from foreseeable criminal acts by third parties resulting from the landlord’s failure to secure common entry points. Defendant’s repeated assurances that he would fix the door, together with his failure to repair or to take other reasonable measures, constitute a knowing or negligent failure to perform his duties as landlord.

5.4    Defendant’s conduct — i.e., failing to repair a door that did not latch properly and thereby allowing unauthorized access to the building, resulting in theft of tenant property and evidence of trespassers sleeping in the basement — constitutes a substantial, unreasonable, and foreseeable interference with Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment of the premises.

5.5    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff suffered actual monetary damages in the form of (a) the value of the package stolen from the hallway, approximately $120.00, (b) out-of-pocket security expenses of approximately $200.00, and (c) other consequential damages, including emotional distress and loss of utility of the premises.

6.     Damages

6.1    As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff claims the following damages, measured conservatively as follows:

       a.    Value of stolen package: $120.00;
       b.    Out-of-pocket expenses for security camera and deadbolt: $200.00;
       c.    Total claimed economic damages: $320.00;
       d.    Reasonable costs and fees of this action, court costs, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

(Wherefore, Plaintiff claims damages in the amount of $320.00 as alleged, and additional relief as requested below.)

7.     Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

7.1    Awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of at least $320.00 for the value of the stolen package and for out-of-pocket security expenses;

7.2    Awarding Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the fullest extent allowed by law;

7.3    Ordering injunctive and equitable relief requiring Defendant to repair and secure the building’s main entry door and take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized entry (including, if the Court deems appropriate, an order requiring Defendant to secure exterior doors and common areas within a reasonable time);

7.4    Awarding Plaintiff the costs of this action and any other relief the Court finds just and proper.

8.     Jury Demand

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Jessica Brown
