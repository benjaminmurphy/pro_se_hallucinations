COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
WORCESTER COUNTY
WORCESTER SUPERIOR COURT

Jordan Thompson,
    Plaintiff,

v.                                                    Civil Action No. _______________

Emily Carter,
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Thompson, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, Emily Carter, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, VENUE, AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Emily Carter is the owner of a three-unit residential apartment building located at 45 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”). At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant owned, controlled, and was responsible for maintenance of the public sidewalk abutting the Premises.

3. Venue is proper in Worcester Superior Court because the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Worcester County and the Premises are located in Worcester. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 3; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1 (venue provisions).

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about February 10, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the sidewalk adjacent to 45 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, delivering groceries to one of the building’s tenants.

5. Defendant had an obligation to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition. After a snowstorm earlier in February 2023, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply any de-icing material (salt or sand) to the cleared path.

6. Over the course of the following days, due to daily melting and nighttime refreezing, the narrow shoveled path became a smooth sheet of ice presenting a hazardous condition.

7. Prior to Plaintiff’s fall, tenants of the building repeatedly notified Defendant by text message and by sending photographs of the icy sidewalk and requested corrective action. Defendant responded, telling tenants, “the sun will take care of it,” and took no steps to apply de-icing materials or otherwise mitigate the known hazardous condition.

8. On February 10, 2023, while lawfully walking on the sidewalk to deliver groceries, Plaintiff stepped into the icy area, his feet slipped from under him, and he fell backward onto the sidewalk, landing heavily on his lower back.

9. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained injury to his lower back, requiring medical treatment. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $600 in wages because he missed approximately one week of work.

10. Defendant’s failure to remove, warn of, or otherwise remedy the hazardous icy condition of the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

11. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 10 as if set forth fully herein.

12. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor or owner of land owes a duty to lawful entrants to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangerous conditions of which the possessor knows or should know. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A; see also Massachusetts decisions applying these principles to premises cases (e.g., slip-and-fall) and recognizing that landowners must take reasonable measures to protect against foreseeable hazards.

13. Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises and to take reasonable measures to remedy or warn of hazardous conditions such as the ice described above.

14. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:
    a. failing to apply de-icing materials (salt or sand) to the shoveled path after the snowstorm;
    b. leaving a narrow cleared path that predictably turned into a sheet of ice from daily melting and refreezing;
    c. failing to respond appropriately to tenant notifications and photographs alerting Defendant to the hazard;
    d. failing to warn lawful users of the sidewalk (including Plaintiff) of the dangerous icy condition.

15. Defendant’s conduct was negligent, careless, and reckless under the circumstances and fell below the standard of reasonable care required of landowners and possessor of premises in Massachusetts.

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury (lower back injury), incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500, lost wages in the approximate amount of $600, and suffered pain, suffering, disability, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and other damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

NOTICE OF CLAIM AND STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

17. Plaintiff alleges this action is timely under the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions in Massachusetts (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A), and in any event all conditions precedent to this action have been performed or have occurred.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITY

For purposes of legal context and to support the Complaint’s allegations concerning duty, breach, causation, and damages, Plaintiff cites the following authorities (non-exhaustive):

Statutes and Rules
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (statute of limitations for actions of tort for personal injury);
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223 et seq. (venue and related provisions);
- Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 10(a), and 11 (pleading requirements and signatures);
- Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (standards for motion to dismiss);

Restatement and Treatises
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (liability for unsafe conditions on land);
- Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A (duty regarding artificial conditions and activities);
- Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 61 (premises liability and owner/possessor duties);

Massachusetts Case Law (illustrative)
- Massachusetts cases recognize that landowners owe a duty to lawful entrants to exercise reasonable care to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of known hazards; Massachusetts courts have applied these principles in slip-and-fall and ice-and-snow cases. See, e.g., decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court addressing premises liability, foreseeability, notice, and the reasonableness of remedial action by landowners. (Plaintiff will rely on applicable Massachusetts case law at trial and in pretrial proceedings.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Awarding compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (but at least approximately $2,500 for past medical expenses and including any future medical care necessitated by the injury);

B. Awarding damages for lost wages and lost earning capacity (including past lost wages of approximately $600 and any future lost earnings proved at trial);

C. Awarding damages for pain and suffering, disability, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial;

D. Awarding interest, costs, and fees as permitted by law;

E. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED this 1st day of December, 2025.

Respectfully submitted,
