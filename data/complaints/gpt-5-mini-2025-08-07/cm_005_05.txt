Jennifer Smith
     Petitioner

v.

David Smith
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

NOW COMES the Petitioner, Jennifer Smith, in pro se, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to Massachusetts law for modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order concerning the parties’ minor children. In support thereof, Petitioner alleges as follows:

PARTIES AND CHILDREN
1. Petitioner, Jennifer Smith, is an adult resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Petitioner’s telephone number is (617) 555-0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.
2. Respondent, David Smith, is the children’s other parent and a resident of Massachusetts.
3. The minor children subject to this proceeding are:
   - Emily Smith, born 2015 (age 10);
   - Jacob Smith, born 2018 (age 7).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Probate and Family Court pursuant to Massachusetts statutory law governing child custody and parental rights because the parties and the children reside in Massachusetts and the existing custody order was entered in Massachusetts.
5. Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

EXISTING ORDERS
6. On April 15, 2022, this Court entered an order providing that the parties share joint legal custody of Emily and Jacob, with the children’s primary residence with Petitioner and a regular visitation schedule for Respondent (hereinafter “Existing Order”).
7. The Existing Order also provides that the parties shall support the children’s relationship with each parent and shall not disparage the other parent in the children’s presence.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS — MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
8. Since entry of the Existing Order, the Respondent has engaged in conduct that materially affects the children’s welfare and the viability of the current custody arrangement.
9. Over the past year, Respondent has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities, programs, and events scheduled to occur during Petitioner’s allocated parenting time without prior discussion or agreement with Petitioner. Respondent does not notify Petitioner in advance and proceeds to require the children to attend these activities when they are in Respondent’s care.
10. Respondent has, on multiple occasions, told the children that any missed activities or changes are Petitioner’s fault when Petitioner has sought to exercise her scheduled parenting time or requested reasonable swaps. The children have related to Petitioner that Respondent has called Petitioner “selfish” and has told them “you don’t really love them” when Petitioner requests scheduling adjustments consistent with the Existing Order.
11. One child, Jacob (age 7), has begun to experience recurrent stomach aches on transition days (exchange days) and has expressed anxiety about exchanges between homes. Emily has expressed worry about disappointing either parent when asked to attend activities scheduled by Respondent during Petitioner’s time.
12. Respondent’s unilateral scheduling of extracurricular activities during Petitioner’s parenting time, combined with derogatory statements about Petitioner in the children’s presence, has interfered with Petitioner’s ability to parent during her scheduled time, undermined the children’s emotional stability, caused distress to the children, and materially altered the circumstances underlying the Existing Order.
13. Petitioner has attempted in good faith to address these issues through communication with Respondent but the problems have persisted; Respondent has continued the behavior described above.
14. Because of these changes and the direct effect on the children’s welfare and the viability of the Existing Order, modification of the custody arrangement is necessary and in the children’s best interests.

LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF
15. Under Massachusetts law, modification of custody or physical placement may be granted where there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the existing order that affects the children's welfare and where the requested modification is in the children’s best interest. See applicable Massachusetts statutes and caselaw cited below.
16. The facts alleged above (interference with parenting time, unilateral scheduling of activities during the other parent’s time, disparagement of the other parent in the children’s presence, and resulting emotional harm to the children) constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the Existing Order.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
A. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order;
B. Modify the existing custody/placement order to award Petitioner primary physical custody of Emily and Jacob, with Respondent’s parenting time structured consistent with the children’s best interests, or, in the alternative, restructure the parenting time to reduce disruption and promote stability for the children;
C. Retain joint legal custody of the children but enter clear, enforceable rules concerning scheduling of extracurricular activities and other commitments (including a requirement that neither parent unilaterally enroll the children in activities that occur during the other parent’s scheduled time without the other parent’s written consent, and a requirement that competing activities be resolved according to specified priorities and with advance notice);
D. Prohibit disparaging remarks about either parent in the children’s presence or within earshot of the children and require mutually respectful communications regarding parenting issues (including use of a court-ordered communication protocol such as email or a parenting app);
E. Order make-up parenting time to compensate Petitioner for times when Respondent’s unilateral scheduling prevented Petitioner from exercising her parenting time, or otherwise provide an equitable remedy for such interference;
F. Order that the children be evaluated or receive counseling with a licensed mental-health professional experienced with children of separated parents, and order that the parents cooperate with such counseling and follow recommendations designed to reduce transition-related anxiety and improve co-parenting;
G. Appoint a parenting coordinator or require participation in co-parenting education if the Court deems it appropriate to assist the parties in implementing and complying with the new schedule and communication rules;
H. Grant such temporary relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate pending final hearing, including injunctive relief to prevent further unilateral interference with Petitioner’s parenting time and to prevent further disparagement of Petitioner in the children’s presence;
I. Award costs, fees, and any other relief the Court deems equitable and proper.

CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE / SERVICE
Petitioner will comply with the Probate and Family Court Rules regarding service and filing of this Complaint and will serve the Respondent with a copy hereof in accordance with the Court’s rules. Petitioner requests that the Court set this matter for hearing at the earliest practicable date.
