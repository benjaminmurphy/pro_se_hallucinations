Mark Thompson,
    Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harris (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2. Plaintiff is an individual and a tenant who resides at 15 Mystic Street, Apartment [insert apt. # if any], Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

3. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner and landlord of the building located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, and is the lessor of Plaintiff’s rental unit.

4. Plaintiff began renting the premises from Defendant on or about May 1, 2022. Plaintiff currently pays monthly rent of $1,500.00.

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Chelsea District Court because the rental premises are located in Chelsea, the amount claimed is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court, and the claims arise out of the landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all times relevant to this complaint, Defendant retained control of and responsibility for the common areas of the building at 15 Mystic Street, including the main entry door and the basement.

7. For approximately two months prior to the filing of this complaint (beginning approximately in or about October 2025), the main entry door to the building has had a broken latch/lock mechanism and does not close or latch securely. The condition is such that the door can be pushed open by strangers.

8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the broken main entry door lock approximately two months ago and verbally requested that Defendant repair the lock. Defendant told Plaintiff that he would fix the lock, but no repair was made.

9. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the need to repair the lock on at least two subsequent occasions. Defendant failed to take corrective action.

10. On or about November 2025, an unknown person entered the building through the unsecured common entry and went through tenants’ mail and packages left in the common hallway. Several tenants, including Plaintiff, had packages taken from the common hallway.

11. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to secure and repair the common entry door, Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately $120.00, was stolen.

12. In addition, Plaintiff has observed evidence that an unknown person has been sleeping in the building basement — a condition that is and has been both dangerous and highly disturbing to Plaintiff and to other tenants. This evidence includes [e.g., bedding/materials, personal effects, signs of overnight occupancy] (observations made in November 2025 and thereafter).

13. Because of Defendant’s failure to repair or secure the common entry door and to maintain reasonable security in common areas, Plaintiff reasonably feared for her personal safety and the safety of her possessions. Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for her own door and a better deadbolt for her unit door at a personal cost of approximately $200.00.

14. Defendant minimized Plaintiff’s concerns, calling Plaintiff “overreacting,” and stated that the neighborhood is safe. Defendant nevertheless failed to remedy the insecure building entry or otherwise take reasonable measures to protect tenants’ safety and property.

15. Defendant’s conduct — failing to secure the main entry door after notice and despite control over common areas and responsibility for maintenance — substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — Massachusetts Common Law)

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord implicitly covenants that the tenant shall have the beneficial and peaceful use and enjoyment of the leased premises free from substantial interference by the landlord’s acts or omissions (the covenant of quiet enjoyment). See, e.g., M.G.L. c. 186, and the common-law doctrine described in Massachusetts case law recognizing an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

18. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment by acts or omissions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including failure to maintain safe and secure common areas and failure to make repairs within the landlord’s control after notice. See, e.g., cases recognizing landlord liability for interference with possession and use and for failing to repair common areas and security (see authorities cited below).

19. Defendant had notice of the defective and insecure main entry door and of the safety risk posed to tenants. Defendant failed to timely or reasonably repair or remedy the defect or to take other reasonable measures to secure the building and its common areas.

20. Defendant’s failure to repair the door and secure the building materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises by exposing her to theft, invasion of privacy, and personal safety concerns, and by forcing Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenditures for security.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including (a) the loss of Plaintiff’s package (approximately $120.00); (b) reasonable expenses incurred to protect herself and her property, including $200.00 spent on a security camera and a deadbolt; and (c) consequential emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment.

22. Plaintiff estimates her total damages arising from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment to be approximately $320.00. Plaintiff additionally seeks pre- and post-judgment interest, costs of suit, and any other relief the Court deems proper.

APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES (Representative Statutes, Regulations, and Cases)

Note: Plaintiff invokes the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized under Massachusetts law. Relevant authorities supporting the legal principle and describing landlord duties regarding maintenance of common areas, security, and tenant remedies include, among others:

Statutes and Regulations
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186 (General provisions relating to landlord-tenant law), including provisions concerning landlord obligations and tenants’ remedies.
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 239 (Summary process; jurisdiction for landlord-tenant disputes).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111 and related public health statutes and regulations imposing duties to maintain sanitary and safe conditions.
- 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (Massachusetts State Sanitary Code — Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation and Housing Code) (regulations governing maintenance, security, and safety of residential buildings).
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (Consumer Protection statute) — while Plaintiff does not assert a separate G.L. c. 93A claim here, the statute has been applied in landlord-tenant contexts to wrongful practices; it provides context for damages and remedies available for certain landlord conduct.

Massachusetts Cases (illustrative, non-exclusive)
- Foley v. Polaroid Corp., 381 Mass. 685 (1980) (recognition of landlord and tenant obligations; discussion of remedies for interference).
- Card v. Davis, 276 Mass. 24 (1931) (discusses landlord obligations and tenants’ possession).
- Cleveland v. Hurley, 374 Mass. 53 (1977) (discusses landlord duties and tenant remedies).
- Hennessey v. North Atlantic Properties, 322 Mass. 693 (1948) (recognition of covenant of quiet enjoyment).
- Duffy v. Strand, 246 Mass. 582 (1924) (interference with possession and enjoyment).
- Saville v. Loma, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 672 (1993) (landlord responsibility for conditions affecting tenant enjoyment).
- DePasquale v. State St. Trust Co., 371 Mass. 775 (1977) (landlord duties regarding premises).
- Anderson v. Balducci, 390 Mass. 162 (1983) (landlord liability for conditions affecting tenants’ use).
- Conway v. Flaherty, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 183 (1988) (remedies for breaches affecting quiet enjoyment).
- Rice v. Wood, 366 Mass. 92 (1974) (relief for tenants for landlord interference).

(These statutes and cases are representative of the legal principles relied upon by Plaintiff concerning the covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlord duties to maintain and secure premises under Massachusetts law, and tenant remedies. Plaintiff relies on the common law as developed by Massachusetts courts and applicable statutory and regulatory obligations affecting landlord maintenance and safety of residential premises.)

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff actual compensatory damages in the amount of $320.00, plus any additional damages that the Court finds were caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to the value of stolen property, reasonable expenses incurred for security, and damages for loss of use and emotional distress;

B. Grant injunctive or equitable relief ordering Defendant to repair and secure the main entry door and to take any additional reasonable measures to secure the building’s common areas to prevent further intrusions, thefts, or unauthorized occupancy;

C. Award Plaintiff costs and disbursements, including filing fees, and such taxable costs as may be allowed by law;

D. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on any award to the fullest extent permitted by law; and

E. Grant such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

TRIAL BY JURY: Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
