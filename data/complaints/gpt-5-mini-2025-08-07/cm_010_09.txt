PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Jessica Thompson
     Plaintiff

Michael Johnson
     Defendant

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME

1. Parties and Residence
   1.1. Plaintiff: Jessica Thompson, residing at 2XXX (street omitted), (City), Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555-0123. Email: psm1443@gmail.com.
   1.2. Defendant: Michael Johnson, residing at 2XXX (street omitted), (City), Massachusetts.

2. Jurisdiction and Venue
   2.1. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts law to modify custody and parenting time orders affecting minor children.
   2.2. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Probate and Family Court because the original custody order was entered in this Court and the minor child currently resides in Middlesex County.

3. Children
   3.1. The subject child is Sophie Johnson, age 10.

4. Existing Custody Order
   4.1. On May 15, 2016, the Probate and Family Court entered an order concerning custody and parenting time for the minor child Sophie Johnson (the “Existing Order”).
   4.2. Under the Existing Order, primary physical residence was awarded to the father, Michael Johnson, with the mother, Jessica Thompson, having limited weekend visits and one weeknight dinner visit per week.

5. Ground for Modification — Material Change in Circumstances
   5.1. The Plaintiff alleges that since the entry of the Existing Order there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child sufficient to warrant modification of custody and parenting time.
   5.2. Specific changed circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:
        a. The circumstances under which the Existing Order was entered have materially changed. At the time of the Existing Order, Plaintiff was a graduate student, living in a small studio apartment, and had a schedule that prevented significant parenting time. Those facts materially affected the parenting time allocation in 2016.
        b. Plaintiff has since completed graduate school, now has stable employment with regular daytime hours and reliable income, enabling consistent day-to-day parenting.
        c. Plaintiff now resides in a two-bedroom apartment where Sophie has a separate bedroom suitable for overnight visits and longer stays.
        d. The Plaintiff’s relationship with Sophie has changed and strengthened: Sophie and Plaintiff have become very close; Plaintiff’s increased availability has deepened their relationship.
        e. Sophie’s mental health provider (therapist) has advised that Sophie expresses guilt when leaving after short visits and indicates a desire for increased time with her mother. Counsel from the therapist supports increasing the mother’s parenting time to benefit Sophie’s emotional well-being.
        f. Sophie has written a letter to the Court expressing her wish for additional overnight visits and more time with Plaintiff.
        g. Defendant refuses to discuss a modification and becomes angry when Sophie raises the subject, which has created tension and emotional stress for the child.

6. Best Interests of the Child
   6.1. The requested modification is made in the best interests of Sophie Johnson. The proposed modification will provide Sophie with increased meaningful contact with both parents while maintaining stability and continuity of care.
   6.2. The Plaintiff is prepared to present evidence at hearing showing that the proposed modification will promote the child’s emotional, developmental, and physical welfare, and is consistent with the child’s stated preferences and the recommendations of the child’s therapist.

7. Relief Requested
   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order as follows:
   7.1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Order dated May 15, 2016.
   7.2. Modify the Existing Order to increase Plaintiff’s parenting time to a schedule that reflects Sophie’s best interests, specifically including, at minimum:
        a. Regular overnight parenting time for Plaintiff such that Sophie has scheduled overnights with Plaintiff during weekdays and/or alternating weekends, as the Court deems appropriate; and
        b. A revised parenting schedule providing increased total time with Plaintiff, consistent with Sophie’s age and developmental needs; and
        c. Any other orders the Court deems necessary to promote Sophie’s stability and welfare (including, where appropriate, interim orders pending final hearing).
   7.3. Enter any additional orders regarding exchange procedures, communication protocols, and therapeutic or reunification services the Court deems necessary to facilitate a successful increase in parenting time.
   7.4. Award any other relief the Court deems just and equitable.

8. Temporary Relief (if requested)
   8.1. Plaintiff requests that the Court consider interim relief pending final hearing, including issuance of temporary parenting time that permits additional overnights with Plaintiff if the Court determines such interim relief is in the child’s best interests.

9. Attachments and Evidence
   9.1. Plaintiff intends to file or produce the following in support of this Complaint:
        a. The Existing Order dated May 15, 2016 (copy attached or on file with the Court);
        b. A letter from Sophie to the Judge expressing her wishes (to be filed under appropriate protective procedures where required by Court rule);
        c. A letter or report from Sophie’s therapist describing Sophie’s expressed feelings about current parenting time and the therapist’s recommendation regarding parenting time (subject to appropriate confidentiality and evidentiary rules);
        d. Documentation of Plaintiff’s current residence (lease) and that Sophie has her own bedroom;
        e. Documentation of Plaintiff’s completion of graduate school and current employment (as needed);
        f. Any other testimonial or documentary evidence the Court finds necessary.

10. Authority

        - Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (matters relating to divorce, custody and support)

        - Relevant decisions interpreting the UCCJEA and Massachusetts custody statutes;
        - Decisions recognizing the weight to be given to a child's expressed preferences, the recommendation of mental health professionals, and changed parental circumstances when deciding custody and parenting time modifications.
   10.2. Plaintiff will cite and rely upon specific statutory sections and controlling Massachusetts decisions as appropriate during briefing and at hearing. (Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court apply the controlling statutory and case authorities regarding material change in circumstances, modification standards, and best interests of the child.)

11. Service

12. Certification
   12.1. Plaintiff certifies under the pains and penalties of perjury that the facts set forth in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief.

It is strongly recommended that you seek the assistance of counsel or the Court’s self-help resources to confirm procedural requirements, service methods, fee waivers (if applicable), and the proper citation of statutory and case authorities for your specific circumstances. If you rely on the statutory and case authority language in court filings, please verify the exact statutory sections and case citations you intend to cite; at hearing you should be prepared to identify the specific Massachusetts statutes and cases that support modification (for example, UCCJEA provisions, statutory provisions relating to custody and modification, and Massachusetts cases addressing material change of circumstances and best-interests analysis).
