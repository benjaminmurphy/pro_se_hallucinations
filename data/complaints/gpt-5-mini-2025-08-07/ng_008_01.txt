Quincy Dining LLC
Defendant

COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

PARTIES, VENUE, AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter ("Plaintiff") is an individual and resident of Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is: Phone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Quincy Dining LLC ("Defendant") is a Massachusetts limited liability company that operates a restaurant located at 123 Main St, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169 (the "Restaurant"). At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, maintained and controlled the Restaurant.

3. Venue is proper in Quincy District Court because the acts and omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred at the Restaurant located in Quincy, Massachusetts and the Defendant conducts business in Quincy. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On August 15, 2023, at approximately dinner time, Plaintiff was an invited customer and business invitee at Defendant’s Restaurant located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA.

5. While walking through the narrow hallway between the Restaurant’s kitchen and dining room, a server dropped a tray containing several water glasses. The glasses broke on the tile floor. The server immediately picked up the broken glass but left the spilled water and ice on the tile floor.

6. The server told others she would "be right back with a mop" but did not place any warning signs, cones, or other visible warnings to alert patrons or staff of the wet condition. The spilled water and ice remained on the tile floor for some time.

7. Approximately ten minutes after the tray was dropped, Plaintiff got up to use the restroom and proceeded through the same hallway. Plaintiff saw the tile floor looked shiny and, without any noticeable warning, stepped onto the area that was wet from the spilled water and ice. Plaintiff slipped on the wet floor, twisting her knee badly.

8. After the fall Plaintiff discovered there remained a visible wet area/puddle on the tile. Plaintiff later overheard Restaurant staff telling each other that they had been "dodging that puddle" for a period of time before Plaintiff fell, indicating that the dangerous condition had existed and was known to Defendant’s staff.

9. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a knee sprain requiring medical treatment, including urgent care evaluation, a knee brace, and weeks of physical therapy.

10. Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical expenses to date are approximately $2,200. Plaintiff has suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,500. Plaintiff continues to experience pain, disability, and inconvenience as a result of the incident and has incurred other damages including but not limited to past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

11. Plaintiff has satisfied all conditions precedent to the bringing of this action, or such conditions have been waived or excused.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Negligence (Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages)

12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 11 above as if fully set forth herein.

13. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to invitees such as Plaintiff to use reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to inspect the premises for hazards, and to warn invitees of dangerous conditions of which Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge and which invitees would not reasonably discover.

14. Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:
   a. Allowing spilled water and ice on a tiled hallway floor to remain in a location used by patrons without promptly cleaning it up;
   b. Failing to place adequate warnings (including but not limited to wet floor cones/signs or otherwise cordoning off the hazard) to alert patrons and staff of the dangerous condition;
   c. Failing to follow the Restaurant’s own procedures, if any, for promptly addressing wet floors and broken glass hazards;
   d. Failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent foreseeable harm to invitees.

15. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the hazardous wet condition in the hallway. The statements by staff that they had been "dodging that puddle" indicate Defendant’s staff had actual knowledge of the condition and that no effective remedial action or warning had been provided in a timely manner.

16. Defendant’s breaches were the proximate and direct cause of Plaintiff’s slip and fall, the twisting of her knee, and the injuries and losses described above.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injuries and damages, including but not limited to medical expenses (approx. $2,200), lost wages (approx. $1,500), pain and suffering, emotional distress, physical limitations, and other compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

LEGAL BASIS

18. Plaintiff brings this action under Massachusetts tort law for negligence. Under Massachusetts law, an owner or occupier of land owes a duty to business invitees to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition and to give warning of latent or concealed dangers known to the owner/occupier but not to the invitee. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 (liability to invitees for failure to remove or warn of dangerous conditions). (Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this Complaint with Massachusetts appellate authority and statutory citations establishing and confirming these principles.)

19. Plaintiff invokes any and all statutory authority and common law principles applicable to this cause of action, and seeks recovery as allowed under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff gives notice that any applicable statute of limitations will be applied and preserved; generally, actions for personal injury in Massachusetts are governed by a three-year limitations period (see, e.g., M.G.L. c. 260, §2A), and this Complaint is timely filed within applicable limitations.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Quincy Dining LLC as follows:

A. Monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:
   1. Past and future medical expenses in an amount to be proven at trial (to date approx. $2,200);
   2. Past and future lost wages and lost earning capacity (to date approx. $1,500);
   3. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;
   4. Any other special, general, and consequential damages allowed by law;

B. Costs of suit, including statutory costs and disbursements;

C. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025
