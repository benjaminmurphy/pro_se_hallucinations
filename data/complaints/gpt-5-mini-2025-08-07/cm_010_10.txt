Lisa Taylor
     Petitioner

v.

Mark Taylor
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY/ PARENTING SCHEDULE

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner. Lisa Taylor (hereinafter "Petitioner" or "Mother"), residing at [address omitted], may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent. Mark Taylor (hereinafter "Respondent" or "Father"), last known residence in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
1.3 Child. This action concerns the custody and parenting time of the parties’ minor child:
     - Emily Taylor, born in 2015 (age 10).
1.4 Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction under Massachusetts law to modify custody and parenting-time orders affecting a child who is domiciled in Massachusetts, and under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C. The existing custody order was entered in this Court and is subject to modification by it.

2. Existing Order
2.1 On May 20, 2015, this Court entered a custody and parenting-time order (the "2015 Order") awarding primary residence of Emily Taylor to Respondent and awarding Petitioner limited parenting time consisting of weekend visits and one weeknight dinner visitation. The 2015 Order remains in effect.

3. Nature of Relief Sought
3.1 Petitioner seeks modification of the 2015 Order to update the custody/parenting-time schedule to reflect a material change in circumstances since entry of the order, and to provide Emily with substantially increased meaningful time and overnight parenting time with Petitioner. Petitioner requests that the Court enter an appropriate revised parenting schedule that serves the child’s best interests, including, if appropriate, increased overnights and a more equal division of residential time, or such other relief as the Court deems appropriate under the circumstances.

4. Factual Allegations Establishing a Material Change in Circumstances
4.1 At the time the 2015 Order was entered, Petitioner was a graduate student, living in a small studio apartment, and had a schedule that was not sufficiently flexible to support significant parenting time or overnights. Those circumstances were expressly relied upon by the parties and by the Court in establishing the 2015 Order.
4.2 Since entry of the 2015 Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances directly affecting Petitioner’s ability to parent and the child’s welfare:
     a. Petitioner has completed her graduate degree.
     b. Petitioner is now employed in a stable position with regular daytime hours and predictable work schedule, enabling consistent caregiving and transportation.
     c. Petitioner now maintains a two-bedroom apartment where Emily has her own bedroom, suitable for regular overnight stays.
     d. Petitioner and Emily have developed a close, age-appropriate parent–child relationship over the years, and Petitioner is actively involved in Emily’s schooling, extracurricular activities, health care, and therapy.
     e. Emily’s therapist has informed Petitioner that Emily experiences guilt when leaving Petitioner after short visits and has expressed a desire for more regular and longer overnight parenting time with Petitioner.
     f. Emily has prepared a written statement expressing her wish for more overnights with Petitioner and her preference that her parenting schedule be modified; Emily has asked Petitioner to present her wishes to the Court.
     g. Respondent has refused to negotiate or discuss any modification and becomes angry when Emily raises the matter, thereby making informal resolution impossible and undermining cooperative decision-making about Emily’s best interests.
4.3 These changed facts materially alter Petitioner’s capacity to care for Emily and materially affect Emily’s emotional and psychological welfare and the practical realities of parenting adopted in the 2015 Order. The changes are of the kind this Court routinely considers when evaluating petitions to modify custody and parenting-time orders.

5. Legal Standard
5.1 Petitioner alleges that modification is warranted under Massachusetts law because (a) there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2015 Order, and (b) modification is in the best interests of the child. The best-interests standard governs custody and parenting-time determinations and permits modification when parental circumstances and the child’s needs have substantially changed since the prior order.
5.2 Petitioner requests that the Court apply governing statutory and decisional law in determining whether to modify the 2015 Order, including consideration of the child’s physical, emotional, developmental, and educational needs, the capacity of each parent to meet those needs, stability and continuity for the child, and the child’s own wishes consistent with age and maturity.

6. Request for Interim Relief
6.1 Petitioner further requests that, insofar as the Court deems appropriate, interim temporary relief be granted while this matter is pending to permit increased parenting time for Petitioner, in order to minimize disruption to Emily and to allow the Court to observe and evaluate the proposed parenting schedule in practice.

7. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
     a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 20, 2015 custody/parenting-time order;
     b. Modify the 2015 Order to provide for increased parenting time and overnight parenting time with Petitioner, and otherwise revise the residential schedule and custodial arrangements in a manner consistent with Emily’s best interests;
     c. Grant such temporary and interim parenting time or custody measures as the Court deems appropriate pending final determination;
     d. Order mediation, parenting coordination, or other alternative dispute resolution if the Court finds such measures likely to assist the parties in reaching a parenting plan consistent with the child’s best interests;
     e. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

8. Verification
I certify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the information contained in this Complaint is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.
