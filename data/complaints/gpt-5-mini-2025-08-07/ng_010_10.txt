COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

1.     Plaintiff Jessica Hart (“Plaintiff”), by and through the undersigned, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mike Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2.     Plaintiff is an individual and resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and at psm1443@gmail.com.

3.     Upon information and belief, Defendant Mike Thompson is an individual who resides in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and is the owner and occupant of the residential property located at 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, MA (the “Property”).

4.     This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the common law of the Commonwealth and applicable statutes governing civil actions in Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Berkshire County Superior Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

5.     The statute of limitations for personal injury actions in Massachusetts is three years. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A. This action is timely because the injury occurred on July 15, 2023 and this Complaint is filed within the statutory period.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6.     On or about July 15, 2023, at approximately the time set forth herein, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of 45 Maple Avenue in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, carrying grocery bags.

7.     Located at or adjacent to the said Property was (and is) a large, mature maple tree. One of the major limbs/branches of the maple tree extended over the public sidewalk.

8.     Over a substantial period of time prior to July 15, 2023, the branch in question presented obvious signs of decay, cracking, and drooping. The condition of the branch was visible and noticeable to ordinary observation.

9.     Plaintiff and neighbors observed the dangerous condition of the branch and, upon information and belief, notified or otherwise informed Defendant of the cracked, drooping condition and recommended that the branch be examined and/or removed by a qualified arborist. Defendant responded that he would “deal with it in the spring” but did not take corrective action.

10.    On July 15, 2023, during a routine summer thunderstorm (not extraordinary or unprecedented in scope—no tornado warnings and no other extreme weather events), the cracked, drooping branch suddenly and unexpectedly fractured and fell onto Plaintiff as she walked along the sidewalk. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and back and knocked her to the ground.

11.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent failure to inspect, discover, remedy, or warn of the dangerous condition of the tree and branch, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.

12.    Plaintiff required medical treatment for her injuries and incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses. Plaintiff also lost wages in the approximate amount of $600 due to missing about one week of work from her retail job.

13.    Plaintiff has suffered pain, suffering, mental anguish, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and economic loss as a result of the incident.

LEGAL BASIS AND FACTS SUPPORTING NEGLIGENCE CLAIM

14.    Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

15.    Defendant owed a duty to members of the public lawfully using the sidewalk adjacent to his property to exercise reasonable care with respect to conditions of his premises that created an unreasonable risk of harm. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (landowner’s duty to invitees and licensees regarding dangerous conditions on the land); Fabre v. Walton, 436 Mass. 517 (2002) (discussing principles of negligence and apportionment of fault). Under Massachusetts law, property owners and occupiers may be liable for injuries caused by dangerous conditions on or emanating from their property where the owner has notice (actual or constructive) of the dangerous condition and fails to take reasonable steps to remedy or warn. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 339.

16.    Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the dangerous condition of the cracked, drooping branch. The dangerous condition was obvious and had been observed by Plaintiff and neighbors, and neighbors had informed Defendant of the condition and urged corrective measures, yet Defendant took no reasonable steps to inspect, mitigate, or warn.

17.    Defendant breached his duty of care by negligently failing to (a) inspect the maple tree and the cracked branch; (b) obtain professional arboricultural assessment and remediation; (c) remove or secure the dangerous branch; and/or (d) warn pedestrian members of the public, including Plaintiff, of the imminent hazard.

18.    Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and losses. But for Defendant’s failure to take reasonable remedial measures after being put on notice of the dangerous condition, the branch would not have fallen on Plaintiff and Plaintiff would not have sustained the injuries and damages described herein.

19.    Plaintiff’s injuries were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to take reasonable precautions with respect to the known dangerous condition. Landowners and occupiers are required to take reasonable measures to prevent harm from hazardous natural conditions on or adjacent to their property where those conditions create an unreasonable risk to lawful visitors to adjacent public ways. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 363; see also commonly accepted negligence principles established by Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (duty and foreseeability); MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382 (1916) (duty imposed based on foreseeability and dangerous conditions).

20.    Plaintiff has suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

CAUSE OF ACTION
Count I — Negligence

21.    Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 20 above.

22.    Defendant owed Plaintiff and the public a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent injury from dangerous conditions associated with the tree on or adjacent to his property.

23.    Defendant breached that duty by failing to inspect, maintain, warn of, or remove the hazardous branch which he knew or should have known posed a risk to lawful pedestrians.

24.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff was injured and suffered damages as alleged above.

25.    Plaintiff’s damages are the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence and include past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other compensatory damages.

APPORTIONMENT / COMPARATIVE FAULT

26.    Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is solely responsible for the negligence that caused Plaintiff’s injuries. To the extent any fault is claimed against any other person or entity (including non-parties), Plaintiff invokes the principles of comparative fault and apportionment as recognized under Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85; Fabre v. Walton, 436 Mass. 517 (2002).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A.     Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for past and future medical expenses (including approximately $2,500 incurred to date), lost wages (including approximately $600 incurred to date), pain and suffering, emotional distress, disability, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B.     Costs of suit and interest allowed by law, including pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by statute and law;

C.     Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
