Mark Johnson
     Respondent

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties and Jurisdiction
1.1 Petitioner: Jessica Taylor, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Petitioner may be reached at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Respondent: Mark Johnson, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
1.3 Minor child: Daniel Johnson, age 8, subject of the existing custody order.
1.4 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts law and the Probate and Family Court’s authority over modification of custody and parenting time orders. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the parties and child reside in Middlesex County and because the existing order was entered by this Court.

2. Existing Order
2.1 On or about September 15, 2018, the Court entered an order concerning custody and parenting time of the minor child Daniel Johnson (the “Existing Order”).
2.2 Under the Existing Order, Petitioner Jessica Taylor was awarded primary physical custody of Daniel. Respondent Mark Johnson was granted three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visitation each week. The Existing Order expressly prohibited overnight visits (no overnights).

3. Statement of Facts Supporting Modification
3.1 At the time the Existing Order was entered Daniel was three years old. The parties acknowledge that the 2018 order reflected the circumstances at that time, including Respondent’s housing situation (a room in a shared apartment with multiple roommates and no space appropriate for a child to sleep).
3.2 Since entry of the Existing Order there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances. The material changes include, among other things:
   a. Changed parental housing: Respondent Mark Johnson now has his own apartment in which Daniel has a separate bedroom and appropriate sleeping arrangements. Respondent’s housing is materially different from the housing that existed in 2018 when the Court denied overnights.
   b. Child’s development and needs: Daniel is now eight years old and attends school full time. He is older and more capable of overnight stays away from the primary home; he has repeatedly expressed a desire for actual sleepovers with his father.
   c. Burdensome current schedule: The current visitation schedule (short weekday visits and a single Sunday afternoon) requires frequent shuttling on school nights, which disrupts Daniel’s homework, bedtime routine, and overall school routine and causes exhaustion and logistical strain for Daniel and Petitioner.
   d. Parental agreement about change: Both parents agree that the current schedule should be updated to reflect Daniel’s age, school schedule, and Respondent’s changed living conditions and that some form of overnight parenting time is appropriate.
3.3 The foregoing changes are substantial and material and were not reasonably foreseeable by the Court at the time the Existing Order was entered.

4. Legal Standard
4.1 Modification of custody or parenting time requires a showing of a material change in circumstances since entry of the last order affecting custody or parental responsibilities, and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. Petitioner alleges that the changes set forth above constitute the requisite material change in circumstances and that modification is in Daniel’s best interests.
4.2 Petitioner requests that the Court exercise its authority to modify the Existing Order to permit an updated parenting time schedule that includes overnight parenting time for Respondent while safeguarding Daniel’s best interests, school schedule, and health.

5. Requested Modification and Relief
5.1 Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the Existing Order as follows (proposed terms are illustrative; Petitioner seeks flexibility for the Court to adopt a specific schedule that the Court finds is in Daniel’s best interest):
   a. Grant Respondent parenting time that includes overnight parenting time. A proposed framework could be:
       i. Every other weekend: Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. (overnight visits Friday and Saturday nights); and
       ii. One agreed-upon weeknight overnight per week (for example, Wednesday overnight to Thursday morning) or two consecutive weeknight overnights every other week, as the Court deems appropriate to balance school obligations; and
       iii. Standard exchanges and transportation provisions to minimize disruption to Daniel’s school routine (for example, registry exchange or a neutral drop-off location; parties to share transportation responsibilities consistent with what the Court orders).
   b. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper to effectuate a schedule that provides meaningful parenting time to Respondent while protecting the best interests of Daniel.
5.2 Petitioner respectfully requests that, in fashioning the order, the Court consider gradual introduction of extended parenting time if the Court deems it appropriate (for example, initial trial overnights followed by evaluation at a status hearing) with the goal of minimizing disruption to Daniel’s schooling and routine and ensuring his safety and welfare.

6. Best Interests of the Child
6.1 The requested modification is sought for the benefit of Daniel and is in his best interests because:
   a. It responds to Daniel’s expressed desire to spend nights with his father in a safe, stable sleeping environment that now exists at Respondent’s apartment.
   b. It reduces the disruption and fatigue caused by frequent short trips during the school week, thereby supporting Daniel’s ability to complete homework, attend school rested, and maintain consistent bedtime routines.
   c. It promotes continued meaningful contact with both parents and recognizes the maturity and developmental stage of an eight-year-old child.
6.2 Petitioner is prepared to cooperate with any reasonable Court-ordered terms to monitor a transition (for example, limited initial overnight visits, follow-up status hearings, or use of family services) to ensure the child’s welfare.

7. Prayer for Relief
7.1 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:
   a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order of September 15, 2018;
   b. Modify the Existing Order to permit Respondent appropriate overnight parenting time and to adopt a parenting time schedule that the Court finds to be in Daniel’s best interests (for example, every-other-weekend overnights plus a limited weeknight overnight or another schedule the Court finds appropriate);
   c. Order such provisions for exchanges, transportation, health care decision-making, and school communication as the Court deems necessary to ensure the child’s best interests are protected; and
   d. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

8. Notice
8.1 Petitioner requests that the Court schedule this matter for a prompt hearing and enter such interim provisions as the Court deems necessary pending final hearing.

Respectfully submitted,
