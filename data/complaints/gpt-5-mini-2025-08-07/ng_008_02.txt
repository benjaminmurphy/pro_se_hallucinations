COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and for her Complaint against Defendant Café Delight alleges as follows:

1. PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE
1.1 Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.
1.2 Defendant Café Delight is a business operating a restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169. Upon information and belief, Defendant owns, operates, manages, controls, and/or maintains the premises at that address where the incident described below occurred.
1.3 Jurisdiction is proper in this Court because the amount in controversy and the subject matter fall within the jurisdiction of the Norfolk Superior Court and because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.
1.4 Venue is proper in Norfolk County under the Massachusetts venue rules because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this county.

2. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
2.1 On August 15, 2023, at approximately dinner service hours, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA (the “Premises”) as a patron and invitee.
2.2 While walking in a narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, a server employed by or acting for Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses. The tray broke, spilling glass and water and ice on the tile floor.
2.3 The server picked up the broken glass but left the water and ice on the tile floor. The server said she would “be right back with a mop,” but she did not clean the water and ice, did not place a barrier or other condition to block access to the area, and did not place any warning sign or give any verbal warning to customers or staff that the floor was wet and hazardous.
2.4 The hallway remained wet and hazardous for at least ten minutes after the tray broke. Other employees were observed “dodging that puddle,” indicating that staff were aware of the hazard and that it persisted for some time.
2.5 Approximately ten minutes after the tray was dropped, Plaintiff walked toward the restroom. Plaintiff observed the tile and, believing it was simply shiny, unknowingly stepped onto the wet area. Plaintiff slipped and twisted her knee, fell or nearly fell, and suffered a significant knee injury.
2.6 As a result of the incident, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at urgent care and was diagnosed with a sprained knee requiring a brace and subsequent physical therapy. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to the injury and treatment.
2.7 Plaintiff has suffered pain, physical impairment, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, and other damages as a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

3. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS AS TO DEFENDANT’S DUTY AND BREACH
3.1 At all relevant times, Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation, maintenance, and management of the Premises, including a duty to make the Premises safe for invitees, to discover dangerous conditions, and to warn of or remedy hazardous conditions of which it knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343A; see also applicable Massachusetts law on premises liability and duties owed to invitees.
3.2 Defendant breached that duty by failing to take reasonable steps to protect patrons from the hazardous condition created by the spilled water and ice, including failing to:
    a. Promptly clean up the water and ice on the tile floor;
    b. Place a warning sign, barrier, or other obvious marker to warn invitees of the hazardous condition;
    c. Adequately supervise employees or supervise cleanup and floor safety procedures in a busy, narrow hallway;
    d. Implement or follow reasonable policies and procedures for prompt spill remediation and hazard communication to customers and staff.
3.3 Defendant’s employees knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known of the hazardous condition and of the need for immediate remediation or warning. The fact that other staff were “dodging that puddle” shows knowledge and a sustained failure to remedy or to warn.

4. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE (SOLE CLAIM)
4.1 Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 3 above as if fully set forth herein.
4.2 Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of latent dangers known to Defendant or which should have been discovered by reasonable inspection.
4.3 Defendant breached that duty by allowing a hazardous condition to remain on the tile floor for an unreasonable period without warning or remediation.
4.4 Defendant’s breach was a proximate and direct cause of Plaintiff’s slipping, knee injury, and the damages described herein.
4.5 As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, medical expenses (approximately $2,500), lost wages (approximately $1,200), and other damages in amounts to be proven at trial.

5. DAMAGES
5.1 Plaintiff claims actual damages for medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, emotional distress, costs of future medical care (if necessary), and other damages permitted by law in an amount to be proven at trial, including the specific amounts set forth above for past medical expenses and lost earnings.

6. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:
    A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;
    B. For costs of suit, attorneys’ fees if applicable, and pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law;
    C. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper; and
    D. That Plaintiff be awarded a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

7. TIMELINESS
7.1 This action is commenced within the time period required by law. The cause of action accrued on August 15, 2023. Plaintiff filed this Complaint on December 1, 2025, within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions under Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.
