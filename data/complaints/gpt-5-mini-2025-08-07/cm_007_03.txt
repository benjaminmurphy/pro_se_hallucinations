COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

1. Parties
1.1 Plaintiff: Emily Carter, 123 (street omitted), (city omitted), Massachusetts; telephone (617) 555-0123; email psm1443@gmail.com. Plaintiff is a parent of the minor child named below and is the moving party in this Complaint.

1.2 Defendant: James Carter, address unknown to Plaintiff for purposes of this pleading (to be provided to the Court and served in accordance with the Rules). Defendant is the other parent of the minor child.

2. Children
2.1 This Complaint concerns the custody and parenting time of the minor child:
- Sophie Carter, born 2013 (age 12).

3. Jurisdiction and Venue
3.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under Massachusetts law. Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court because the original custody order was entered in the Probate and Family Court and the parties and child have connections to Bristol County.

3.2 Plaintiff seeks modification of a custody order previously entered by this Court on May 10, 2018 (the “2018 Order”).

4. Relief Requested
4.1 Plaintiff seeks the following modification(s) of the 2018 Order:
a) An order modifying primary physical custody of the minor child to the Plaintiff (Emily Carter), and awarding Defendant (James Carter) parenting time consistent with the child’s best interests and the Defendant’s current health and safety limitations;
b) Entry of a revised parenting schedule that reduces Defendant’s unsupervised overnight and high-risk time with the child and provides for parenting time that is safe, structured, and tailored to the Defendant’s physical capabilities (for example, day-time visits at the Defendant’s residence only with appropriate in-home assistance or supervised visits, or overnight parenting time only when a qualified caregiver is present);
c) An order requiring that exchanges occur in a safe, neutral location and establishing a written exchange protocol that protects the child’s safety (including prohibiting the child from performing physically demanding or caregiving tasks for Defendant);
d) An order directing the Defendant to provide to the Plaintiff and the Court, within a reasonable time, medical documentation from Defendant’s treating physician regarding his diagnosis, prognosis, limitations, and recommended accommodations for contact with the child; and
e) Any further and additional relief the Court deems just and proper, including temporary emergency modifications pending hearing.

5. Background Facts
5.1 The 2018 Order established equal physical custody of the parties’ daughter, on an alternating-week (one week on/one week off) schedule, which worked well for several years while both parents lived nearby and were able to care for the child.

5.2 Since the entry of the 2018 Order, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition. The Defendant’s health has deteriorated to the extent that he has experienced multiple falls at home.

5.3 Defendant’s treating physician has advised Defendant that he should not be alone with the child near stairs or in situations requiring quick or forceful physical response. Defendant continues to live in a residence with stairs and has had recent falls in that environment.

5.4 Despite the foregoing, Defendant insists on maintaining the exact alternating-week schedule and, during his custodial time, sometimes relies on the Parties’ twelve-year-old daughter to assist him with transfers (for example, moving from wheelchair to bed) and to bring him items. On multiple occasions the child has been asked or expected to perform caregiver tasks that are not age-appropriate and that raise safety concerns.

6. Material Change in Circumstances
6.1 Under Massachusetts law, modification of an existing custody order is permitted when there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the order and modification is in the best interests of the child. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s progressive neurological condition, his history of falls, physician recommendations limiting his ability to be alone with the child in certain circumstances, and his reliance on the child to assist him constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification.

6.2 The change described in paragraph 6.1 materially affects the child’s safety, stability, and routine, and requires an immediate re-evaluation of physical custody and parenting time arrangements to protect the child’s welfare and to ensure that parenting time is meaningful but safe.

7. Best Interests of the Child
7.1 Modification as requested is in the child’s best interests for the following reasons:
a) Safety: The child has been asked to perform physically risky and caregiving tasks for the Defendant; placing primary physical custody with the Plaintiff will protect the child from undue caregiving responsibilities and potential harm from falls or emergency situations when physical assistance is needed.
b) Stability and Routine: The Plaintiff can provide a predictable routine and environment absent the physical hazards identified in Defendant’s home and circumstances.
c) Parental Relationship: Plaintiff does not seek to eliminate Defendant’s relationship with the child; Plaintiff seeks a modification that preserves relationship-building through safe, structured parenting time aligned with the Defendant’s abilities and medical needs.
d) Medical Oversight: Requiring Defendant to provide medical documentation and to comply with reasonable safety conditions will enable the Court and parties to tailor parenting time to the real limitations posed by his diagnosis.

8. Temporary Relief Requested
8.1 Given the ongoing safety concerns, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter temporary emergency relief pending the hearing on this Complaint, including but not limited to:
a) Temporary primary physical custody to Plaintiff;
b) Temporary supervised or modified parenting time for Defendant pending submission of medical information and a hearing; and
c) Temporary protocols for exchanges and communication to protect the child’s safety.

9. Legal Authorities
9.1 Plaintiff relies on the established legal principles governing custody modification in Massachusetts: modification requires a material change in circumstances since entry of the prior decree and the modification must be in the child's best interests. See generally Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 and applicable Probate and Family Court practice.

9.2 Relevant legal authorities addressing custody modification and the best-interests standard include (by way of example and not limitation):
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208 (jurisdiction over divorce and related custody determinations) and related provisions governing custody orders and modification;
- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215 (procedural provisions governing civil actions in the courts) and applicable rules of the Probate and Family Court;
- Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259 (1978) (parental rights subject to fair process);
- Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (parental rights and best interests standard considerations);
- Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions recognizing that custody modification requires a showing of a material change in circumstances and consideration of the best interests of the child (see, e.g., cases interpreting and applying the material change/best interests framework in Massachusetts family law);
- Decisions of the Massachusetts appellate courts recognizing the Court’s broad discretion to fashion parenting arrangements that protect child safety while preserving parental relationships;
- Probate and Family Court rules and local practice regarding temporary orders, emergency relief, and medical/mental health evaluations in custody matters;
- Authoritative treatises and practice manuals interpreting Massachusetts custody law and counseling courts on factors including parental health and the child’s safety in modification proceedings.

(If the Court requires specific statutory section citations and reported case law, Plaintiff will provide and rely upon the specific authorities the Court prefers. Plaintiff specifically requests the Court consider the foregoing well-established principles and applicable Massachusetts precedent in deciding this matter.)

10. Request for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
a) Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 custody order;
b) Modify the 2018 custody order to grant primary physical custody of Sophie Carter to Emily Carter and enter a parenting schedule for James Carter that is consistent with his documented medical limitations and the child’s safety and best interests (including, as appropriate, supervised or professionally assisted visits, restrictions on unsupervised time near stairs or in situations requiring rapid physical assistance, and prohibition on the child performing caregiver tasks for Defendant);
c) Order Defendant to provide current medical documentation from his treating physician regarding his diagnosis, prognosis, limitations, and recommended accommodations within a time set by the Court;
d) Enter temporary emergency orders pending final hearing as set forth in paragraph 8.1 above;
e) Order reasonable exchange protocols and safety procedures (including neutral exchange locations if appropriate) and require that neither parent require the child to perform caregiving tasks beyond age-appropriate responsibilities;
f) Award any other relief the Court deems just and equitable, including payment of costs and such further relief as the Court deem proper.

11. Certification and Verification
11.1 Pursuant to applicable rules, Plaintiff certifies that to the best of her knowledge the allegations in this Complaint are true and correct based on her personal knowledge and belief.
