      "reasoning": "Complaint alleges an extended lack of hot water (~three weeks) and concrete consequences (gym membership and travel costs, moving infant to another residence for baths, boiling water, altered household practices), and characterizes hot water as an essential service \u2014 facts that sufficiently plead a material/substantial interference with use and enjoyment."
