COMPLAINT — NEGLIGENCE

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Reynolds, and for his Complaint against the Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC, alleges as follows:

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Reynolds is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 and psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC is a business entity that operates a rideshare service providing drivers and vehicles for hire in the City of Boston and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Defendant transacts business in Suffolk County and may be served at its principal place of business or through its registered agent.

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action as a civil action for personal injury and property damage occurring in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court because the occurrence giving rise to this action occurred in the City of Boston, Suffolk County.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On August 15, 2023, at approximately [time], Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle and riding in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

6. At that time and place, a motor vehicle operated by or under the control of an agent, servant, employee, or driver engaged by Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC was stopped and parked in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the bike lane.

7. Plaintiff was travelling lawfully in the bike lane, obeying traffic laws and signals, and wearing a helmet.

8. As Plaintiff approached the parked vehicle, the vehicle’s driver suddenly opened the driver-side door into the bike lane without looking and without reasonably ensuring that it was safe to do so.

9. The door opened directly into Plaintiff’s path. Plaintiff had no opportunity to avoid the door, could not stop or swerve in time, and collided with the edge of the vehicle door.

10. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff was thrown from his bicycle and struck the pavement.

11. At the scene the driver admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone. When Plaintiff later submitted a claim to the driver’s insurance company, the insurer stated that the driver claimed Plaintiff had been “weaving in and out of traffic,” which Plaintiff denies. At the time of the incident Plaintiff was riding lawfully and within the bike lane.

12. As a direct and proximate result of the collision, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including road rash to his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and rendered unusable.

13. Plaintiff incurred and/or paid approximately $1,200 in medical and dental expenses to treat injuries sustained in the collision. Plaintiff also lost approximately $400 in earnings/wages as a direct result of the incident and related injuries, and incurred out-of-pocket costs to replace his bicycle. Plaintiff continues to suffer pain, inconvenience, embarrassment, scarring, and loss of enjoyment of life.

14. All of the foregoing occurred as the direct and proximate result of the negligence of the Defendant and/or the Defendant’s agent, servant, or employee, as set forth below.

COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Defendant owed a duty to the traveling public, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care in the operation, control, and management of its vehicles and of its drivers, and a duty to ensure that vehicle doors were not opened into the path of bicyclists or other road users unless and until it was reasonably safe to do so.

17. Defendant, through its driver, breached those duties by one or more of the following negligent acts and omissions, among others:

    a. failing to look and reasonably ascertain that it was safe to open the vehicle door into the adjacent bike lane before opening it;

    b. opening a vehicle door into the path of a bicyclist without taking reasonable precautions to prevent harm;

    c. failing to ensure that the driver was not distracted by a mobile phone or other device while occupying or operating the vehicle;

    d. permitting and/or directing drivers to park or stop in a manner that endangered bicyclists and other road users; and

    e. otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

18. At all relevant times the driver of the vehicle was acting within the scope of his/her employment and agency with respect to Defendant, or Defendant is otherwise vicariously liable for the driver’s conduct under principles of respondeat superior.

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain, mental anguish, disfigurement, medical and dental expenses, loss of earnings, property damage (including the bicycle), and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial but including approximately $1,200 in medical/dental expenses and approximately $400 in lost wages, plus the cost to replace the bicycle and recoverable damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

APPLICABLE LAW — GENERAL PRINCIPLES

20. Plaintiff brings this action under the common law of negligence as recognized in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to exercise reasonable care for the safety of others and violated that duty by opening the vehicle door into the path of oncoming traffic without reasonable care. Under established principles of Massachusetts tort law, a person who breaches a duty of care that is the proximate cause of another’s injury is liable for resulting damages.

21. Plaintiff intends to rely at trial on applicable Massachusetts statutory and common-law principles governing the operation of motor vehicles, duties to other road users (including bicyclists), and the civil liability of vehicle owners and employers for the acts of their drivers, as well as evidence of driver distraction and admission at the scene that the driver did not see Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Compensatory damages for medical and dental expenses in an amount not less than $1,200 and for lost wages in an amount not less than $400, together with the reasonable cost of repair or replacement of Plaintiff’s bicycle, all to be proven at trial;

B. Compensatory damages for past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, disfigurement, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by a jury;

C. Interest, costs, and disbursements allowed by law;

D. Such further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025

Respectfully submitted,
