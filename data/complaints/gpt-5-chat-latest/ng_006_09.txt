---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Michael Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. Upon information and belief, Defendant **Jason Reynolds** (“Defendant”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was, at all relevant times, operating or in control of a motor vehicle registered in Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has **subject matter jurisdiction** over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, because the matter in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in **Suffolk County** under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Boston, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On **May 15, 2023**, at or about **123 Elm Street, Boston, MA 02108**, Plaintiff was lawfully bicycling to work in a clearly marked bicycle lane.  
6. Plaintiff was riding pursuant to all applicable traffic laws and wearing a protective helmet.  
7. Defendant was operating and/or in control of a motor vehicle parked adjacent to the bike lane in a designated loading zone.  
8. Without warning and without first checking for oncoming traffic or bicyclists, Defendant suddenly opened his driver-side door directly into the bike lane.  
9. Plaintiff had no time to stop or evade the door and collided forcefully with its edge.  
10. Plaintiff was thrown from his bicycle, striking the pavement and sustaining **road rash on his arms and legs, and a chipped front tooth**.  
11. Plaintiff suffered physical pain, emotional distress, property damage, and incurred medical expenses of approximately **$2,500**, as well as **lost wages of approximately $800**.  
12. Plaintiff’s bicycle was also damaged beyond repair, requiring replacement at Plaintiff’s own expense.  
13. At the scene, Defendant admitted that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was “checking his phone.”  
14. Defendant’s insurance company later denied the claim, wrongly asserting that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”  
15. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action.  
16. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful user of the public way, a duty of reasonable care in the operation and control of his motor vehicle and in opening his vehicle door.  
17. Defendant breached that duty by opening his door without first ensuring that it was safe to do so, in violation of **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, which prohibits opening any vehicle door unless it is reasonably safe and can be done without interfering with other traffic.  
18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, property damage, economic losses, and other harms.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

19. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 as though fully set forth herein.  
20. Under **Massachusetts common law**, every motorist owes a duty to operate and park a vehicle with reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)**; **Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1990)**.  
21. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, including to look for oncoming bicyclists before opening his car door. *See* **Massachusetts Highway Department Bicycle Transportation Plan** (citing “dooring” as a foreseeable hazard requiring driver caution).  
22. Defendant breached his duty of care by:  
    a. Opening the door of his parked vehicle without ensuring that it was reasonably safe;  
    b. Failing to keep a proper lookout;  
    c. Using a handheld electronic device while parked next to a bike lane; and  
    d. Failing to operate and control his vehicle in a manner consistent with the safety of others.
23. Defendant’s conduct violated **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, which itself provides evidence of negligence under *Breen v. Burns*, **280 Mass. 222 (1932)**, and *Guinan v. Famous Players-Lasky Corp.*, **267 Mass. 501 (1929)**.  
24. Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligence within the meaning of *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Authority*, **376 Mass. 101 (1978)**.  
25. Defendant’s actions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law as recognized in *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, **389 Mass. 47 (1983)** (duty arises from foreseeability of risk), *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, **411 Mass. 401 (1991)** (breach established where conduct fails reasonable person standard), and *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, **423 Mass. 637 (1996)** (proximate causation requires only foreseeability of harm).  
26. Plaintiff’s comparative negligence, if any, was less than that of Defendant, and thus Plaintiff is entitled to recovery pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (*comparative negligence statute*).  
27. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the legal and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses.

### V. DAMAGES

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical pain, suffering, and mental anguish;  
   b. Permanent scarring and cosmetic injury (chipped tooth);  
   c. Medical and dental expenses in the approximate amount of **$2,500**;  
   d. Lost wages in the approximate amount of **$800**;  
   e. Damage to personal property, including Plaintiff’s bicycle; and  
   f. Loss of enjoyment of life and general inconvenience.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Michael Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Jason Reynolds**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **compensatory damages** in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$50,000**;  
C. Award **interest and costs** pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C**;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
