**SARAH THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**MICHAEL JOHNSON**,  
Defendant  

---

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(pursuant to G. L. c. 208, § 28; G. L. c. 209C, § 20; and G. L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order dated **June 15, 2021**, issued by the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court, concerning the minor child **Emily Johnson (born [insert DOB if known])**, on the grounds of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the child.

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Sarah Thompson, residing within Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and the primary custodial parent of the parties’ minor child, **Emily Johnson (age 7)**. Plaintiff’s contact information is:  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Johnson, the father of the minor child, presently residing or intending to relocate to **New Hampshire** for employment.

---

### **II. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER**

3. On **June 15, 2021**, this Honorable Court entered a **custody and parenting time order** awarding the Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the parties’ minor child, with the Defendant having parenting time **every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend**, based upon both parties living in the **Cambridge, Massachusetts** area.

4. The 2021 order was mutually workable at the time because the parents resided within a short distance of one another, and the child attended a local elementary school in Cambridge.

---

### **III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

5. Since entry of the 2021 custody order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances**. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, has **accepted a job in New Hampshire** and intends to **relocate** there.

6. The Defendant’s move would result in a **significant increase** in commuting time—approximately **ninety (90) minutes each way in traffic**—for the minor child on midweek overnights.

7. The midweek overnight now requires Emily to travel long distances late at night and early mornings to attend school, causing her anxiety, disrupted sleep, and missed or truncated participation in after‑school activities.

8. The current custody schedule no longer serves Emily’s **best interests**, as defined by **G. L. c. 208, § 31**, and has become **impracticable and detrimental** to her welfare due to the Defendant’s relocation.

---

### **IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD**

9. Pursuant to **G. L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a prior custody judgment when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification serves the **best interests of the child**.

10. Under **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**, and **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**, the Court must focus on the child’s stability, developmental needs, schooling, and emotional well‑being when assessing any modification request.

11. The relocation dramatically alters the context in which the original schedule was set and introduces excessive travel demands inconsistent with Emily’s developmental and academic needs.

12. The principles articulated in **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**, **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**, and **Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)**, underscore that maintaining continuity and minimizing stress are primary factors in determining a child’s best interests.

13. Continued enforcement of the current midweek overnight arrangement would conflict with Emily’s schooling, extracurricular involvement, and emotional welfare, contrary to the reasoning in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**, where the Court recognized that any custody or parenting time order must balance parental rights with the child’s best interests in light of changed circumstances.

14. The Defendant’s out‑of‑state relocation constitutes a “material change” contemplated in **Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016)**, requiring reevaluation of a parenting plan originally premised on geographically proximate households.

15. Judicial precedent also recognizes that modifications are appropriate where the prior order has become “unworkable” or “detrimental” to the child—see **Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996)**, and **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)**.

16. Massachusetts law permits modification upon a showing that the change “has a significant effect on the welfare of the child.” **Schuh v. Schuh, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 202 (2006)**; **G. L. c. 208, § 31**.

---

### **V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

17. Plaintiff requests the Court to modify the custody and parenting time order entered on June 15, 2021, to reflect the current realities and to protect Emily’s best interests.

18. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that:

   a. The **midweek Wednesday overnight** be **removed**, and that midweek parenting time, if any, occur **within reasonable daytime or weekend parameters** compatible with Emily’s school schedule; and  
   
   b. The **weekend parenting schedule** be adjusted to maximize quality parenting time for both parents while minimizing disruptive travel—for example, permitting extended or consecutive weekend visitation periods during school breaks or holidays; and  
   
   c. Any other adjustments or conditions the Court deems just and proper to serve the best interests of the child.

---

### **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the prior custody order of June 15, 2021;  
2. Determine that modification of the order is in the **best interests of the minor child** under **G. L. c. 208, § 28**, **G. L. c. 209C, § 20**, and applicable case law;  
3. Modify the custody and parenting schedule as set forth above; and  
4. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems equitable and proper.
