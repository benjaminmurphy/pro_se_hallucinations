**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)**  
___________________________________________________________  

Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Thomas Richards (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:  

---

### I. PARTIES

1.  Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
2.  Defendant **Thomas Richards** is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201, where he owns and maintains residential property.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3.  Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, §4**, because the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred within Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy exceeds \$25,000.  
4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 214, §1**, and personal jurisdiction over the Defendant pursuant to **G.L. c. 223A, §3(a)**, as Defendant resides in this Commonwealth.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5.  At all relevant times, Defendant owned and controlled the property located at **123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts**.  
6.  In front of said property stood a large maple tree with a substantial branch extending over the public sidewalk.  
7.  For an extended period before **July 15, 2023**, the branch displayed clear signs of damage and decay: it was cracked, drooping, and visibly unstable.  
8.  Plaintiff and other residents of the neighborhood observed and discussed the dangerous condition of the branch.  
9.  Several neighbors, including the Plaintiff, informed Defendant of the hazardous condition and suggested that he engage a professional arborist to inspect and remedy it.  
10.  Defendant acknowledged awareness of the condition and stated that he would “deal with it in the spring,” but took no action.  
11.  On **July 15, 2023**, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm, the damaged branch broke and fell onto the sidewalk as Plaintiff lawfully walked past carrying groceries.  
12.  The branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground.  
13.  As a direct result, Plaintiff sustained a **shoulder strain** and **multiple bruises**.  
14.  Plaintiff required emergency room and follow-up medical care, incurring reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately **\$3,500**.  
15.  Plaintiff also lost approximately **\$600** in wages due to inability to work for about one week.  
16.  The weather conditions at the time were normal and foreseeable; there were no extreme or unforeseeable events that could act as a superseding cause.  
17.  Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, or remove the hazardous branch constituted a breach of his duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining his property in a condition safe for foreseeable pedestrian use.

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

18.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–17 as if fully set forth herein.  
19.  Under Massachusetts law, property owners have a duty to maintain their premises, including trees and structures adjacent to public ways, in a reasonably safe condition so as not to pose an unreasonable risk of harm to lawful users of the public sidewalk. See **G.L. c. 231, §85**, establishing comparative negligence principles.  
20.  Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injuries resulting from the dangerous condition of the tree branch extending over the sidewalk. See **Gage v. Westfield, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 681 (1989)** (duty to maintain property free of foreseeable hazards reaching public way).  
21.  Defendant breached that duty by failing to act despite actual notice of the hazard. See **Hannon v. Hayes-Bickford Lunch Sys., Inc., 336 Mass. 268 (1957)** (failure to correct known dangerous condition constitutes negligence).  
22.  The condition of the tree was open, obvious, and known to Defendant long before the incident; his delay in taking action rendered the harm foreseeable. See **Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013)** (landowner must act reasonably to prevent foreseeable harm to lawful entrants).  
23.  The branch’s collapse and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent maintenance of his property. See **Jardine v. Weem, 347 Mass. 674 (1964)** (proximate cause established where injury naturally flows from negligent maintenance).  
24.  There was no superseding or intervening cause of the injury, as the weather was typical for the season and foreseeable. See **New England Power Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 20 Mass. App. Ct. 25 (1985)**.  
25.  Defendant’s conduct constituted a breach of his duty under **Restatement (Second) of Torts §364**, as adopted in **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**, imposing liability on landowners for conditions on land causing injury to persons lawfully using adjacent ways.  
26.  Defendant’s negligence caused Plaintiff actual damages, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress.  
27.  Plaintiff exercised due care at all relevant times and was lawfully using the sidewalk. See **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 231, §85**, establishing that a plaintiff’s negligence, if any, does not bar recovery unless greater than that of Defendant.  
28.  Under **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**, the standard of reasonable care supersedes antiquated distinctions regarding natural or artificial conditions; thus Defendant’s failure to act reasonably regarding the tree branch is actionable negligence.  
29.  See also **Sullivan v. Old Colony St. Ry. Co., 200 Mass. 303 (1908)** (foreseeability is key element of duty of care); **Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983)** (landowners must anticipate foreseeable risks and take reasonable precautions).  
30.  Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused damages to Plaintiff within the meaning of **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 231, §85J**, authorizing recovery for personal injuries caused by negligence.

### V. DAMAGES

31.  As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a.  Medical expenses of approximately **\$3,500**;  
   b.  Lost wages of approximately **\$600**;  
   c.  Physical pain and suffering;  
   d.  Emotional distress and inconvenience; and  
   e.  Such further expenses and losses as may be proven at trial.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

a.  Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;  
b.  Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, reasonably estimated to exceed **\$50,000**;  
c.  Award Plaintiff her costs and reasonable interest under **G.L. c. 231, §6B**;  
d.  Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper; and  
e.  Impanel a jury to hear all triable issues of fact.  

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**.
