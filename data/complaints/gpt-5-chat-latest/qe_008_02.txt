**JESSICA HARRINGTON,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**THOMAS B. MITCHELL,**  
Defendant.

---

### COMPLAINT  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

---

#### I. INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harrington (“Plaintiff”) brings this complaint against her landlord, Thomas B. Mitchell (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, section 14, and interpreted by authoritative Massachusetts appellate decisions.  
2. Defendant’s prolonged failure to repair a broken entryway lock at Plaintiff’s residence at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts, resulted in unauthorized access, mail theft, and fear for Plaintiff’s personal safety. Defendant’s inaction has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s tenancy and quiet possession of her leased premises.

#### II. PARTIES

3. Plaintiff Jessica Harrington is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  
4. Defendant Thomas B. Mitchell is an individual and the owner and landlord of the property located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

---

#### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19, and G.L. c. 186.  
6. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court because the premises are located within the Court’s jurisdiction and because the cause of action arose therein.

#### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff began renting the apartment at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts, from Defendant on or about June 1, 2021, pursuant to a month‑to‑month tenancy, paying $1,500 per month in rent.  
8. The building’s main entry door lock has been broken since at least October 2025. The latch does not engage properly and allows anyone to enter the building without a key.  
9. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of this defect approximately two months before the date of this complaint (around October 1, 2025).  
10. Defendant acknowledged the condition and stated he would repair it but has failed to do so.  
11. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the defective lock twice thereafter; on both occasions, Defendant assured Plaintiff that the repair would be completed soon but took no action.  
12. In November 2025, unauthorized individuals entered the building’s common areas. Several tenants, including Plaintiff, experienced mail theft; Plaintiff lost a package worth approximately $120.  
13. Plaintiff has since discovered evidence that an unknown individual has been sleeping in the basement of the property.  
14. Plaintiff felt unsafe in her home, purchased a security camera and a new deadbolt for her unit at a personal cost of approximately $200.  
15. Defendant has characterized Plaintiff’s concerns as “overreacting” and has refused further discussion or remediation regarding the entryway security.  
16. Defendant’s failure to maintain essential security features of the building caused intrusion, property loss, and mental distress to Plaintiff, all impairing her lawful right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

#### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14**

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for actual and statutory damages.  
19. The warranty of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  
20. The landlord has an affirmative duty to maintain the premises, including common areas, in a condition fit for habitation and security. See *Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 326 Mass. 393 (1950); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
21. A persistent failure to remedy a serious and known defect that permits intruders and endangers tenants constitutes an interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Foster v. Bartolomeo*, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 595 (1992).  
22. Defendant’s inaction in addressing the defective entry lock enabled unlawful entry, theft, and the presence of unauthorized persons, substantially disturbing Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
23. Defendant’s failure was not an isolated incident but continued for more than two months after repeated notice, demonstrating disregard of statutory obligations under G.L. c. 186, §14 and G.L. c. 239, §8A, and regulatory standards under 105 C.M.R. 410.480 (requiring doors and locks in good repair).  
24. Plaintiff’s fear, loss of property, and expense in purchasing additional security measures were direct consequences of Defendant’s interference.  
25. The covenant’s protection extends to security and peaceful possession. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord’s acts need not be willful if they cause substantial interference); *Dorgan v. Loukas*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1985) (unremedied safety conditions violate quiet enjoyment).  
26. Massachusetts appellate courts recognize liability where a landlord’s failure to correct conditions results in fear or loss of use. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004).  
27. Defendant’s conduct also violates public policy requiring landlords to provide secure housing. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
28. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a direct and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, entitling Plaintiff to damages under G.L. c. 186, §14.

#### VI. DAMAGES

29. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:  
   a. Loss of property in the amount of approximately $120;  
   b. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for security upgrades totaling $200; and  
   c. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of peace in her home.  
30. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages or three months’ rent—whichever is greater—as statutory damages, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, even though she appears pro se.  

---

#### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Harrington respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, in an amount no less than three months’ rent ($4,500), or such greater sum as the Court deems equitable;  
C. Alternatively, award actual damages of no less than $320 plus compensation for emotional distress;  
D. Award Plaintiff court costs, allowable expenses, and any statutory attorney’s fees recoverable by pro se litigants under applicable law; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
