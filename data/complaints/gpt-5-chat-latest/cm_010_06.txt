### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** (actions for modification of custody and child support orders) and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as this Court issued the original custody order on March 15, 2018.  

4. Venue is proper in the **Worcester Probate and Family Court**, where the original judgment was entered and where the child has resided for a substantial period of time.  

---

### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

5. On **March 15, 2018**, this Honorable Court issued a custody judgment granting **Michael Turner** primary physical custody of the minor child, **Emily Turner**, with **Jessica Turner** having limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner visit.

6. At the time the order was entered, **Plaintiff** was completing graduate school, resided in a small studio apartment, and maintained a demanding academic and work schedule.

7. Since that date, circumstances have materially changed. **Plaintiff** completed graduate school, has secured stable full‑time employment with standard hours, and now resides in a two‑bedroom apartment where the child has her own dedicated room.

8. Over the past several years, **Plaintiff** and **Emily** have developed a close and nurturing relationship. The child’s therapist—whose opinion is independent and professional—has reported that Emily consistently expresses distress and guilt about leaving her mother’s home after brief visits.

9. The child, now age ten, has written a letter to this Honorable Court stating that she wishes to spend additional time, including overnights, with her mother.

10. **Defendant** has refused to discuss any modification to the existing schedule and, according to the child, becomes angry when the topic is raised, creating emotional tension and discomfort.

11. The material changes in the mother’s circumstances—enhanced stability, completion of education, establishment of a suitable residence, and the child’s strong emotional bond with her—constitute a **substantial and material change in circumstances** warranting modification under Massachusetts law.

12. The requested modification is consistent with the **best interests of the child**, as defined in **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a)**, and interpreted by the courts in cases including *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000), and *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

### **LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION**

13. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified "upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child."

14. In determining whether a modification is warranted, Massachusetts courts consider both the change in parental circumstances and the child’s welfare. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006); *Miller v. Miller*, 478 Mass. 642 (2018).

15. A parent’s increased stability, improved housing, and greater ability to provide care may constitute a material change. *Care and Protection of Erin*, 443 Mass. 567 (2005); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

16. The emotional well-being and expressed wishes of the child are highly relevant to the best‑interest analysis. *Custody of a Minor (No. 1)*, 377 Mass. 876 (1979); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).

17. The Court must ensure that the child’s developmental and emotional needs are served by frequent and meaningful contact with both parents. *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

18. When a noncustodial parent demonstrates improved parenting capacity and stability, expansion of parenting time is warranted. *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

19. In the instant case, there has been a clear, continuing, and material change in circumstances:  
    a. Plaintiff has completed her education and obtained stable employment.  
    b. Plaintiff now has appropriate and permanent housing.  
    c. The child’s developmental and emotional needs have evolved with age and maturation.  
    d. The child’s own expressed preference and therapeutic support underscore the benefit of increased time with Plaintiff.  

20. Therefore, modification is required to serve the best interests of Emily Turner in accordance with the governing precedent and statutory framework.

### **REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, **Plaintiff, Jessica Turner**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child since the issuance of the judgment dated March 15, 2018;  

2. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting‑time order to increase the Plaintiff’s parenting time and establish a shared or joint physical custody arrangement consistent with the child’s best interests;  

3. **Adopt** or order a revised parenting plan providing the Plaintiff with additional overnights and expanded visitation consistent with Emily’s needs, including—but not limited to—alternate weekends from Friday through Monday morning, one midweek overnight, and equitable vacation and holiday schedules;  

4. **Order** such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
