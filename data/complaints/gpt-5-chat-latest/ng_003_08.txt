# COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Jessica Mills (“Plaintiff”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Lowell Home Goods, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Lowell Home Goods”), and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Mills is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Lowell Home Goods, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation with a principal place of business located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, which grants jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about October 1, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (“the Store”).  
7. Plaintiff was shopping in the kitchenware section of the Store, an area open to the public and under the control of Defendant.  
8. Defendant had stacked multiple heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens, approximately five or six units high, on open shelves without securing them by safety straps, barriers, or restraints.  
9. Another customer, while pushing a shopping cart in the aisle, made incidental contact with the lower shelving, whereupon one of the boxed appliances fell from an upper shelf.  
10. The falling box struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and the side of her head.  
11. Plaintiff immediately experienced pain and dizziness, and the store manager was summoned to the scene.  
12. The store manager completed an incident report and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.  
13. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, and she presented to the emergency department at a local hospital.  
14. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a mild concussion and right shoulder strain.  
15. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200 and missed several days of work as a delivery driver, resulting in lost wages of approximately $600.  
16. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, inconvenience, and a loss of enjoyment of life, including temporary inability to participate in recreational activities such as her weekly soccer league.  
17. The condition of the shelving and the manner in which Defendant displayed merchandise created an unreasonable risk of injury to customers such as Plaintiff.  
18. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the dangerous condition because stacking heavy boxes unsecured on high shelves was an obvious hazard.  
19. Defendant failed to inspect, maintain, or adequately secure its merchandise displays to prevent foreseeable harm to invitees.  
20. Defendant’s acts and omissions directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully set forth herein.  
22. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty to lawful visitors to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers of which it knows or should know. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).  
23. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful business invitee, a duty to maintain its premises in a condition that was reasonably safe for customers shopping in the aisles. *See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 371 (2010).  
24. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things:  
   a. Failing to secure heavy boxed merchandise properly on high shelving;  
   b. Failing to install barriers or restraints to prevent falling items;  
   c. Failing to inspect or monitor merchandise stacking; and  
   d. Failing to warn customers of the risk of falling merchandise.  
25. A reasonably prudent retailer in the same or similar circumstances would have foreseen that unsecured heavy items placed high on open shelving could fall and injure customers. *See* **Berard v. Hildreth**, 215 Mass. 492 (1913) (foreseeability of harm is central to negligence).  
26. Defendant’s actions and omissions constituted negligence under Massachusetts common law and applicable safety standards. *See* **Carter v. Yardley & Co., Ltd.**, 319 Mass. 92 (1946) (defendant liable where conduct foreseeably causes injury).  
27. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. *See* **Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG**, 399 Mass. 790, 794 (1987).  
28. Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety at all relevant times. *See* **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence standard).  
29. Defendant is responsible for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees and agents acting within the scope of their employment. *See* **Worcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc.**, 408 Mass. 393 (1990).  
30. Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, emotional distress, medical expenses, and lost earnings as a direct result of Defendant’s negligence. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540, 546 (1982).  
31. Defendant’s conduct was unreasonable and in violation of the duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff and to the public. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
32. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff is entitled to recovery for all damages sustained pursuant to Massachusetts law, including **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and the principles stated in **Donovan v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.**, 455 Mass. 215 (2009).

   c. Pain and suffering;  
   d. Emotional distress; and  
   e. Loss of enjoyment of life and recreational activities.  
34. Plaintiff’s total damages exceed $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

## VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
