### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, **Rachel Smith**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, M.G.L. c. 215, § 6, and the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure, to modify the existing custody and parenting-time order entered by this Court on **April 15, 2021**, concerning the minor children **Emily Smith (born [insert DOB, age 8])** and **Noah Smith (born [insert DOB, age 6])**.

---

**II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Rachel Smith, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** James Smith, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has proper jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, and venue in Middlesex County is proper as both parties and the children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.  
4. The original Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time was entered in this Court on **April 15, 2021**.  

---

**IV. RELEVANT BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER**

5. The existing order grants the Plaintiff, Rachel Smith, primary physical custody of the children. The Defendant, James Smith, currently has parenting time with the children on alternating weekends and one midweek overnight per week.  
6. At the time of the original order, both parties worked regular daytime hours, and the agreed‑upon schedule served the best interests of the children.

---

**V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since entry of the April 15, 2021 order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** within the meaning of **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**.  
8. Specifically, the Defendant, James Smith, recently began employment on a **night shift schedule**, working **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** several nights each week, including many of the nights when he is scheduled to have the children in his care overnight.  
9. Because of his new work schedule, the Defendant has repeatedly returned the children to the Plaintiff’s home on short notice, stating he is too fatigued to provide appropriate supervision, or he has left the children with a roommate the Plaintiff barely knows.  
10. The minor children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant frequently sleeps for extended periods during his parenting time, while the children occupy themselves unsupervised, and sometimes fall asleep on the couch while he naps after working overnight shifts.  
11. These developments materially affect the **children’s safety, welfare, and stability**, and the existing parenting schedule is no longer in their best interests.  

---

**VI. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES**

12. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a modification of custody or visitation may be made "upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the modification is necessary in the best interests of the children."  
13. The Court’s primary consideration in any custody determination is the **best interests of the child**, as established in **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**.  
14. In **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**, the Appeals Court held that a significant change affecting the child’s daily wellbeing may warrant modification even if each parent remains fit.  
15. **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)** and **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)** emphasize the importance of stability, continuity, and the child’s overall wellbeing over parental convenience.  
16. **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)** and **Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406 (1976)** make clear that the trial court must reassess custody when new facts show that circumstances have materially changed in a way that affects the children’s welfare.  
17. **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)** reaffirms that the child’s best interests are paramount, and a parent’s changing work conditions can constitute a material change.  
18. **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31** defines “shared legal custody” and “physical custody” and authorizes the Court to modify custodial arrangements consistent with the children’s best interests.  
19. **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6** grants the Probate and Family Court equitable authority to modify its prior judgments as justice and equity require.  
20. **Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010)** and **Sullivan v. Sullivan, 466 Mass. 886 (2014)** together confirm that when a parenting plan fails to meet a child’s current needs due to a parent’s work constraints, modification serves the child’s best interest.  
21. The facts presented here clearly establish such a **material and substantial change**, warranting prompt modification.

---

**VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

22. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order as follows:

   a. That all overnight parenting time for the Defendant, James Smith, shall occur **only on nights when he is not scheduled to work overnight**;  
   b. That in weeks where the Defendant works overnight shifts, his parenting time shall occur during his off days or weekend days only;  
   c. That the Plaintiff be granted temporary authority to adjust the parenting schedule as necessary to provide for the children’s childcare and school attendance when the Defendant’s work schedule changes with short notice; and  
   d. That the Court grant such other relief as it deems just and proper.

---

**VIII. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN**

23. The Plaintiff seeks this modification to ensure a consistent, predictable, and safe environment for the children’s nighttime routines, schooling, and emotional stability.  
24. The requested modification serves their best interests under the governing principles of **M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31**, as articulated in **Custody of Kali**, **Mason v. Coleman**, and related case law.  

---

**IX. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the Judgment of April 15, 2021;  
2. Modify the custody and parenting schedule so that Defendant’s overnight parenting time occurs only when he is not working overnight;  
3. Make such further orders as are necessary to protect the stability and best interests of the children; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
