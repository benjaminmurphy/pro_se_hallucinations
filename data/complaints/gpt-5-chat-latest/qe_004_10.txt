### COMPLAINT  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jordan Miller** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.  
2. Defendant **Harold Finch** (“Defendant”) is an individual who owns and manages the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 (“the Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19 and G.L. c. 185C, §3, as this is an action for damages not exceeding $50,000 arising from a violation of G.L. c. 186, §14.  
4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Worcester County and the leased property is located in Worcester. *See* *Silva v. Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge*, 424 Mass. 667, 670 (1997).

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the Premises at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, at a monthly rent of **$1,300**.  
6. Plaintiff at all relevant times has complied with all material terms of the rental agreement, including timely payment of rent.  
7. Beginning approximately **September 2025**, Plaintiff observed persistent signs of rodent infestation, including mouse droppings, in the kitchen and other areas of the Premises.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of this condition, consistent with the reporting requirements under *G.L. c. 186, §14* and *G.L. c. 111, §127L*.  
9. Defendant responded by placing a few traps but took no further comprehensive extermination measures necessary to eliminate the infestation.  
10. Despite temporary efforts, the infestation persisted, and Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings regularly throughout Fall 2025.  
11. Defendant has refused to implement adequate and sustained pest control measures, stating such steps would be “too expensive” and asserting that rodents were “normal for older buildings.”  
12. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$200** in food losses from contamination concerns and approximately **$80** in costs for resealable containers to protect food and property.  
13. The infestation, Defendant’s failure to remedy it, and Defendant’s dismissive responses have caused Plaintiff distress, anxiety, and a substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
14. The rodent infestation constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, *105 C.M.R. §410.550*, and renders the Premises unfit for human habitation.  
15. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and to address known unsanitary conditions constitutes an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. *See* *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under *G.L. c. 186, §14*, landlords are prohibited from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  
18. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises free from rodent infestation and his refusal to undertake adequate extermination measures constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and lawful use of the apartment.  
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from conditions that materially impair their tenancy, including those violating the State Sanitary Code. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).  
20. Conditions that persist after notice and deprive a tenant of freedom from disturbance or frustration of use amount to a breach under Massachusetts law. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 201–02 (1979).  
21. Defendant, having notice and adequate time to act, failed to remedy the infestation and thereby constructively interrupted Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–17 (1977) (landlord responsibility for foreseeable interference caused by its own acts or omissions).  
22. Defendant’s conduct violated *G.L. c. 186, §14* and relevant case law including:  
    - *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (constructive interference from persistent water leaks);  
    - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977);  
    - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997);  
    - *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  
    - *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979);  
    - *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (tenant entitled to damages for loss of quiet enjoyment);  
    - *McAllister v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300 (1999);  
    - *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985);  
    - *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987);  
    - *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (linking warranty of habitability and quiet enjoyment).  
23. Defendant’s breach was willful in that he knowingly refrained from undertaking reasonable steps despite notice of continuing violations. *See* *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 871 (1991).  
24. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered damages including loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, discomfort, property loss, and incidental expenses totaling approximately **$280**, and reserves the right to amend this amount at trial.
