**SARAH THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL JOHNSON**,  
Defendant.  

---

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, *Sarah Thompson* (“Mother”), pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209, § 37; and the equitable powers of this Honorable Court, and respectfully petitions this Court to modify the existing custody order entered on **May 15, 2018**, in the above-captioned matter, regarding the parties’ minor child, **Emily Johnson (age 10)**.  

---

## **I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 215, § 6.  
2. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because both parties reside within Middlesex County and the original order was entered by this Court.  

---

## **II. PARTIES**

3. The Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson. Her contact information is as follows:  
   - Address: [Plaintiff’s Street Address]  
   - Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   - Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

4. The Defendant, **Michael Johnson**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Emily Johnson.  

---

## **III. PRIOR ORDER**

5. On **May 15, 2018**, this Court entered a Judgment providing that the child’s **primary residence** be with the father, **Michael Johnson**, and granting the mother **limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner**.  

6. That judgment was entered when the child was four years old and was based on the circumstances existing at that time.  

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since entry of the 2018 custody order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** affecting both the child and the parents.  

8. At the time of the initial order, the Mother was a graduate student living in a studio apartment and had an inflexible academic schedule.  

9. The Mother has since:  
   a. **Completed her graduate education**;  
   b. **Obtained steady full‑time employment** with regular hours;  
   c. **Secured stable housing** in a two‑bedroom apartment where Emily has her own bedroom; and  
   d. **Maintained a consistent, positive relationship** with her daughter over the past several years.  

10. The child, **Emily Johnson**, is now ten years old, with significantly different developmental and emotional needs from when the original order was issued.  

11. Emily’s **therapist’s observations** indicate that Emily experiences **emotional distress** when leaving her mother after short visits and desires additional time with her.  

12. Emily has expressed in writing to the Court her wish for **more overnights with her mother**, demonstrating her maturity and capacity to express a reasoned preference.  

13. The father has **refused to discuss** any reasonable modifications to accommodate the child’s emotional well‑being and has responded with **anger** when Emily has raised the topic, placing unnecessary stress on the child.  

14. These circumstances constitute a **material and substantial change** warranting a modification of custody and parenting time to serve the child’s best interests.  

---

## **V. LEGAL STANDARD**

15. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child** and where modification is necessary in the **best interests of the child**.  

16. The “best interests of the child” is the **paramount consideration** in all custody determinations. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  

17. Courts have consistently held that custody modifications are warranted when the original circumstances have meaningfully changed and continuing the existing order would not serve the child’s welfare. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Kale*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 708 (1988).  

18. The Court’s analysis focuses on whether modification will promote the child’s emotional, physical, and developmental well‑being. See *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).  

19. In considering the child’s expressed preference, particularly where a child demonstrates maturity, the Court may weigh the child’s wishes as one of several relevant factors. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987).  

20. Improved stability or parental fitness, acquired after the entry of the prior order, may constitute a material change justifying modification. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  

21. Where one parent’s circumstances materially improve and such improvement would enhance the child’s well‑being, modification may be ordered. See *Draper v. Draper*, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 1125 (2004) (Rule 1:28 decision).  

22. Further, persistent conflict or hostility that adversely impacts the child may constitute a material change. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

23. The Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G.L. c. 209B, confirms this Court’s continuing jurisdiction to modify existing custody judgments for children who reside in Massachusetts.  

24. The Mother’s demonstration of improved housing, educational attainment, and work stability presents precisely the type of changed circumstances recognized in *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981), as sufficient to revisit custody and parenting‑time arrangements.  

25. Therefore, a modification of the existing parenting plan is warranted to reflect the current realities of the family and, most importantly, the child’s needs.  

---

## **VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

26. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody order as follows:  

   a. **Physical custody and parenting schedule:** Increase the Mother’s parenting time to a shared custody arrangement, including regular overnight periods each week and alternating weekends, consistent with the child’s expressed preferences and best interests.  

   b. **Legal custody:** Maintain existing joint legal custody or modify as the Court deems necessary to ensure effective co‑parenting.  

   c. **Therapeutic and parenting communication provisions:** Require both parties to support the child’s ongoing relationship with each parent and to continue therapeutic counseling for Emily to monitor her adjustment.  

   d. **Any additional relief** deemed just and appropriate to serve the child’s best interests.  

---

## **VII. CONCLUSION**

27. A genuine, material, and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the 2018 custody judgment.  

28. Modifying the custody and parenting‑time order to expand Sarah Thompson’s role and parenting time with Emily Johnson is **necessary to serve the child’s best interests** under Massachusetts law.  

---

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred;  
2. Modify the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered on May 15, 2018;  
3. Approve a revised custody and parenting schedule providing significantly increased time, including overnights, with the Mother; and  
4. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
