## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **January 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the second-floor apartment at **12 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124**, consisting of two bedrooms.  
6. Plaintiff has paid a monthly rent of **$1,500**, which has been fully and timely paid throughout the term of occupancy.  
7. During the **winter of 2024–2025**, the heating system servicing the premises repeatedly malfunctioned, causing indoor temperatures to drop to approximately **60 degrees Fahrenheit** for several hours at a time, particularly in the evenings.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of these heating deficiencies on multiple occasions.  
9. Defendant arranged for repair personnel to visit the premises twice. Although the heat functioned adequately for brief periods thereafter, the problem recurred.  
10. On the second occasion, the repair technician informed Plaintiff that the **boiler was “old but functional”** and that no substantial repairs would be undertaken.  
11. The continuous temperature drops persisted throughout the season, particularly during cold evenings, rendering the premises partially uninhabitable.  
12. Defendant took no further remedial action despite notice and opportunity to correct the deficiencies.  
13. As a result of the inadequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and operate **two portable space heaters**, increasing her electric bill by approximately **$150 per month** for three months.  
14. Plaintiff suffered **bronchitis** in January 2025, which her physician attributed to prolonged exposure to cold indoor air.  
15. Plaintiff missed **three days of work** and incurred medical expenses for antibiotics and related treatment.  
16. Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate and consistent heating substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to **quiet enjoyment** of the premises.  
17. Plaintiff provided Defendant ample opportunity to remedy the situation, but Defendant failed to restore proper and reliable heating.  
18. Plaintiff now seeks damages of at least **$600**, representing out-of-pocket losses and impairment of her quiet enjoyment.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

19. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises, including by failing to maintain essential services such as heat.  
21. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in all residential leases in Massachusetts. *See* **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
22. Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate and consistent heat constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982) (landlord liable for repeated flooding and failure to repair); **Darmetko v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (repeated inaction constitutes violation of covenant).  
23. Massachusetts law recognizes that lack of adequate heat or essential services constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* **McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 429 Mass. 300 (1999); **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
24. Defendant’s conduct also violates the **State Sanitary Code**, specifically **105 C.M.R. § 410.201**, which requires that heating facilities be capable of maintaining a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64°F at all other times.  
25. A violation of the Sanitary Code constitutes a **constructive violation** of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973); **Hannon v. Original Gunite Aquatech Pools, Inc.**, 385 Mass. 813, 820 (1982).  
26. Defendant’s inaction, despite repeated notice, amounted to a knowing and reckless disregard of her legal duties to maintain habitable conditions, giving rise to liability under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
27. Plaintiff suffered measurable damages including increased utility costs, medical expenses, and discomfort from cold living conditions.  
28. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, as well as **reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.**  
29. Plaintiff seeks an award of actual damages of at least **$600**, or alternatively **three months' rent ($4,500)** as statutory damages under **§ 14**, together with costs.
