### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Miller**, and respectfully seeks a modification of the existing custody order issued by this Honorable Court on **May 15, 2018**, concerning the minor child **Emily Miller**, age ten (10). Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the inherent equitable powers of the Probate and Family Court, the Plaintiff asserts that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the child, such that modification of the custody arrangement is warranted and necessary.

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Norfolk Probate and Family Court** pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, which confer continuing jurisdiction upon this Court to modify custody and visitation orders involving minor children.  

5. The original Judgment of Custody was issued by this Court on **May 15, 2018**, awarding **primary physical custody to the Defendant** and **parenting time to the Plaintiff consisting of alternate weekends and one weeknight dinner**.  

6. The child has resided within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts continuously since the entry of that order, satisfying the jurisdictional requirements of the **Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (G.L. c. 209B)** and **G.L. c. 208, § 28A**.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS IN SUPPORT OF MODIFICATION**

7. At the time of the original order, the Plaintiff was enrolled in graduate school, living in a small studio apartment, and employed with a limited and inflexible schedule, which constrained the parenting plan that could be reasonably implemented.  

8. Since 2018, substantial material changes have occurred in the Plaintiff’s circumstances that directly bear on her ability to care for and nurture her daughter:  

   a. The Plaintiff has **completed her graduate education** and obtained **stable, full‑time employment** with regular weekday hours;  
   b. The Plaintiff has **secured a two‑bedroom apartment**, providing Emily with her **own bedroom and suitable living conditions**;  
   c. The relationship between the Plaintiff and child has **deepened significantly**, as confirmed by the child’s licensed therapist;  
   d. The child has **expressed a consistent and developmentally appropriate desire** to spend additional time with the Plaintiff, including overnights during the school week.  

9. The child’s therapist has indicated that Emily experiences guilt and emotional distress due to the brevity of current visits, suggesting that enhanced parenting time would support her emotional and psychological well‑being.  

10. The Defendant, Kevin Miller, has declined to discuss any adjustment to the parenting schedule and reportedly reacts with anger when the child raises the subject, creating tension and stress for Emily.  

11. The current parenting plan no longer serves Emily’s best interests because it restricts meaningful contact with the Plaintiff, despite strong and stable parental capacity, emotional bonding, and improved living circumstances.

### **LEGAL STANDARD**

12. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a court may revise and alter its judgments relating to the custody of minor children when “the circumstances of the parents or the benefit of the children require.”  

13. A modification may be granted where there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior judgment, and where the modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the child** (*Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)).  

14. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a change in a parent’s stability, home environment, or relationship with the child may constitute a material change sufficient to revisit custody determinations (*Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)).  

15. The “best interests” standard requires consideration of all factors affecting the child’s welfare, including the child’s relationship with each parent, emotional needs, developmental level, and expressed preferences (*Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)).  

16. When determining whether modification is warranted, the Court must evaluate whether the current arrangement detrimentally affects the child’s emotional health and stability (*Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998)).  

17. In similar cases, courts have recognized that improved stability and parental availability constitute “changed circumstances” under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and justify modification (*M.C. v. P.C.*, 479 Mass. 246 (2018); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986)).  

18. The Plaintiff contends that her enhanced personal stability, suitable living accommodations, and the child’s emotional needs collectively represent a material and substantial change warranting judicial modification of the existing custody order.

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

19. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court find that:  

   a. A **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the 2018 order; and  
   b. It is in the **best interests of Emily Miller** that the parenting plan be modified to allow for **shared physical custody** or, at a minimum, **substantially increased parenting time** for the Plaintiff.  

20. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the current custody arrangement to provide for:  

   - Weeknight overnights during the school week, as appropriate;  
   - Equitable division of weekends;  
   - Alternating or shared holidays and school vacations;  
   - Any other conditions the Court deems consistent with Emily’s welfare and stability.  

21. The Plaintiff further requests that the parties be ordered to participate in **co‑parenting counseling or mediation**, if necessary, to facilitate cooperative communication and reduce conflict in Emily’s presence.

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Miller**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Accept jurisdiction over this matter;  
2. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the judgment entered on May 15, 2018;  
3. Modify the existing custody and parenting plan consistent with the best interests of Emily Miller;  
4. Grant such additional and further relief as justice and equity may require.
