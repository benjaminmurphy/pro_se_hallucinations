### COMPLAINT  
**(Negligence – Personal Injury)**

---

**PARTIES**

1.  Plaintiff, **James Miller**, is an individual residing in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. He is the father and natural guardian of the minor child, [initials of minor withheld], an eight-year-old student enrolled in the after-school program operated by the defendant.

2.  Defendant, **Brockton Community Center** (“Defendant”), is a Massachusetts nonprofit or corporate entity maintaining its principal place of business at **1234 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301**, and at all relevant times owned, operated, supervised, and maintained the community center and its after-school programs.

---

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, and **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit and the events giving rise to this action occurred within the judicial district of this Court.

4.  Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, § 9**, as the cause of action arose in Brockton, Massachusetts.

---

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5.  On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s minor son was a participant in the after-school program operated by Defendant at **1234 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts**.

6.  Defendant represented and advertised that children enrolled in its after-school program would be **supervised at all times** while participating in gym activities.

7.  At approximately 4:00 p.m. on the date in question, there were about twenty children in the gymnasium under the supervision of a single staff member, while the second assigned staff member left to complete paperwork elsewhere in the facility.

8.  The remaining staff member was inattentive and occupied with her mobile phone, failing to observe the children closely as required.

9.  During this period of inadequate supervision, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began engaging in a rough, tackle-style game on the hardwood gym floor.

10.  Several children informed the staff member of the rough play. She responded dismissively, stating, **“boys will be boys,”** and took no corrective action.

11.  Moments later, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son was tackled violently by one of the older boys, causing his head to strike the gym floor. He lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.

12.  As a result, Plaintiff’s son sustained a **concussion**, required emergency medical treatment, and was treated at a hospital in Brockton, Massachusetts.

13.  Plaintiff incurred **medical expenses of approximately $5,000**, and suffered **lost wages of approximately $1,200** while caring for his injured son.

14.  Defendant owed Plaintiff’s son a **duty of reasonable care** to provide adequate supervision, ensure a safe environment, and prevent foreseeable injuries to children in its custody.

15.  Defendant breached that duty by failing to adequately supervise the play area, permitting dangerous rough play, and failing to intervene when notified of the risk.

16.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s son sustained the injuries and losses described above.

**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

17.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.

18.  Under Massachusetts law, a person or entity that undertakes the care and supervision of a child owes a duty to act as a reasonable person under the circumstances to protect that child from foreseeable harm. See **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331 (1983); **Glidden v. Maglio,** 430 Mass. 694 (2000).

19.  A duty of supervision arises when children are entrusted to the care, custody, and control of another. See **Wallace v. Wilson**, 292 Mass. 251 (1935); **McDonald v. Lavery**, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1105 (1989).

20.  Defendant breached its duty of care by allowing a hazardous and unsupervised game to continue, by failing to provide adequate staffing, and by ignoring explicit warnings from participating children. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (foreseeability of harm central to negligence); **Framingham v. Pizzano**, 308 Mass. 76 (1941).

21.  Foreseeability of injury from unsupervised rough play by minors is clear; Defendant’s failure to supervise directly caused the injuries suffered by Plaintiff’s son. See **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37 (2009); **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc.**, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002).

22.  Plaintiff and his son suffered actual damages, including medical expenses, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of consortium. See **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc.**, 54 Mass. App. Ct. at 639; **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540, 557 (1982).

23.  Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A** (1965), as adopted by Massachusetts courts, governing duties arising from special relationships such as those between custodians and their charges.

24.  Plaintiff brings this action individually and on behalf of his minor child, pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 85A–85Q**, and **G.L. c. 231, § 6D**, seeking compensation for injuries proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.

**DAMAGES**

25.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff and his son sustained:
   - Past medical expenses of approximately **$5,000**;  
   - Lost wages of approximately **$1,200**;  
   - Pain and suffering of the minor child;  
   - Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   - Additional out-of-pocket expenses and other damages to be proven at trial.
