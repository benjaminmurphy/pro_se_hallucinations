It does not discuss motorists, public ways, or the scope of a motorist\u2019s duty to bicyclists or other road users. Because the case never addresses duties of drivers on public ways, it does not support the stated proposition about motorists owing reasonable care to all users, including bicyclists.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiffs suffered actual loss, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused their loss. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 281 (1965); J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 204 (2d ed. 1989). Causation is an essential element of that proof."

The case concerns a drunk driver striking a pedestrian and whether an adjacent business owed a duty to alter a state highway, not the baseline negligence duty of motorists themselves. Therefore, it does not provide authority for the stated proposition about motorists\u2019 duties to all users of public ways.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Before liability for negligence can be imposed, there must first be a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and a breach of that duty proximately resulting in the injury. ... It is well established that an owner or possessor of land owes a common law duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. ... Although a landowner or possessor typically is not held to any duty with respect to public highways adjacent to or crossing his land, he must exercise reasonable care in the use of his land so as not to injure a traveler on the highway."

It does not involve negligence, motor vehicles, bicycles, duties of care, or any facts about opening car doors or looking for oncoming bicyclists. Therefore it provides no authority for the claimed duty-of-care proposition and appears to be a miscitation or entirely inapposite authority.",

Guarente, for instructions as to whom and in what proportions they should pay the principal of the trust fund and the income accruing thereon. ... The important question is to determine the effect to be given to the instrument executed by the settlor and trustee on June 20, 1923.

The dissent expressly accepts that there was evidence of negligence (e.g., inadequate locking system) but concludes that plaintiff failed to prove causation; it therefore does not establish or affirm the proposition that the defendant\u2019s conduct is negligent, and in any event is not the controlling holding of the case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The next inquiry is whether, if the assailant was a lawful visitor, the jury could have found that he gained entrance to the plaintiff\u2019s room due to the defendants\u2019 negligence. I agree that the jury could have found that the system for locking the room door was inadequate due to the defendants\u2019 negligence, but I do not agree that the jury could have found that entry into the room was gained by disengaging a lock."

      "support_reasoning": "The case does not hold that the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes negligence as a matter of law; it holds only that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care and therefore that the negligence claim may proceed to a jury. The court expressly leaves to the jury whether Kask breached that duty and whether her conduct was negligent. Thus, the opinion supports the existence of a duty under Massachusetts common law in these circumstances, not a definitive finding of negligence.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that a homeowner who permits guns to be stored on her property and allows unsupervised access to that property by a person known by her to have a history of violence and mental instability, has a duty of reasonable care to ensure that the guns are properly secured. This duty is owed to, inter alia, a law enforcement officer shot by the person granted unsupervised access... We therefore reverse summary judgment on the negligence claim and leave to a jury the determination whether Kask exercised reasonable care."

It reiterates the Massachusetts rule that statutory violation is only \u2018some evidence\u2019 of negligence and does not itself establish a breach of duty. Thus, the opinion is direct authority against the claimed proposition that such statutory violations constitute negligence per se.",

The case is narrowly focused on an evidentiary issue: the trial judge\u2019s discretion in excluding expert testimony about the cause of a flash of flame. Therefore, it cannot be used as authority for the proposition that violation of G.L. c. 90, \u00a7 14 constitutes evidence of negligence per se.",

Cardozo explicitly treats the causation/proximate cause question as \u201cforeign to the case\u201d once he concludes there was no duty and thus no tort. The opinion is thus authority against the proposition that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the direct and proximate result of defendant\u2019s negligence in this factual scenario.",

Relatively to her it was not negligence at all\u2026 The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability.
