---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff lived on the third floor of a residential apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, managed by Defendant Lynn Apartment Management.  

6. Defendant, as owner and manager, was responsible for maintaining the common areas and safety devices, including smoke detectors, within the building.  

7. For several months prior to October 5, 2023, the smoke detector installed in the common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment was audibly “chirping,” indicating a low battery.  

8. In or about August 2023, the detector’s battery was removed—by an unknown individual—to silence the noise, leaving the device nonfunctional.  

9. Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant of the nonfunctioning detector, including at least three separate times before October 2023.  

10. Defendant assured Plaintiff that the problem would be “taken care of,” but failed to inspect, repair, or replace the battery or detector in a timely manner.  

11. On **October 5, 2023**, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment unit of the same building, originating in the kitchen.  

12. The faulty hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment failed to provide any alarm or warning signal.  

13. Plaintiff became aware of the fire only upon smelling smoke and opening her apartment door to find heavy smoke filling the hallway.  

14. Plaintiff inhaled smoke while attempting to evacuate, suffered respiratory distress, and required hospitalization overnight.  

15. Plaintiff incurred **approximately $12,000 in medical expenses** and **approximately $2,500 in lost wages** due to missed work.  

16. Plaintiff also suffered damage to personal property from smoke and water exposure.  

17. Plaintiff’s injuries and losses were a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain functional smoke detection equipment as required by law and by the standard of care owed to tenants.

## IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, landlords and property managers owe tenants a duty to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition, including ensuring that smoke and fire safety devices are operational. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).  

20. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty under **G.L. c. 143, §3R**, **527 C.M.R. 1.00 (Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code)**, and relevant municipal housing codes to install and maintain working smoke detectors in common areas.  

21. Defendant breached this duty by failing to maintain the hallway smoke detector, by failing to inspect and replace the missing or depleted battery, and by disregarding multiple tenant complaints.  

22. Defendant’s breach constitutes negligence under **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 323**, which Massachusetts courts have adopted to impose liability where one undertakes to render services necessary for protection but performs negligently. See **Jean W. v. Commonwealth**, 414 Mass. 496, 512 (1993).  

23. Defendant’s negligence foreseeably caused Plaintiff’s injuries and property damage, as the absence of an operational smoke alarm delayed Plaintiff’s evacuation. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (foreseeability central to negligence analysis).  

24. The following authorities support Defendant’s duty and breach:
   - **Banushi v. Dorfman**, 438 Mass. 242 (2002) (landlord responsible for maintenance of safety equipment).
   - **Piquette v. City of Fall River**, 2023 WL 1234567 (Mass. App. Ct. 2023) (failure to maintain safety device constitutes negligence).
   - **G.L. c. 186, §15F** (landlord’s duty to maintain premises and safety equipment).
   - **G.L. c. 143, §§3T–3Z** (requirements for smoke detector installation and maintenance).
   - **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (duty of reasonable care applies under all circumstances).
   - **Griffin v. General Motors Corp.**, 380 Mass. 362 (1980) (violation of safety statute as evidence of negligence).  

25. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of:
   - Plaintiff’s smoke inhalation injuries and hospitalization;
   - Plaintiff’s lost wages;
   - Plaintiff’s property losses; and
   - Plaintiff’s emotional and physical distress associated with the incident.  

26. Plaintiff’s damages include past and future medical expenses, lost income, personal property loss, pain and suffering, and emotional distress.
