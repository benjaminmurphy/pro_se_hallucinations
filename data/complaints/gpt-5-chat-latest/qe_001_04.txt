Defendant.  

Civil Action No. ___________

### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

#### I. PARTIES

1.  Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 2, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  
2.  Defendant, **Thomas Wright**, upon information and belief, is a landlord and owner of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”).

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §3**, as this action concerns a tenancy in Boston and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the Housing Court.  
4.  Venue is proper in the **Boston Housing Court Department** under **G.L. c. 218, §19C**, because the property that is the subject of this action is located within the court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5.  Plaintiff entered into a written or oral tenancy with Defendant commencing on or about **January 1, 2022**, for the rental of the Premises at a monthly rent of **$1,600**.  
6.  Beginning in the winter of **2024–2025**, Plaintiff experienced recurring heat loss in the Premises. Indoor temperatures regularly dropped to approximately **60°F** for several hours at a time, especially during the evenings.  
7.  Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the heating problems on multiple occasions.  
8.  Defendant sent repairpersons twice; although minor repairs were attempted, the boiler continued to malfunction and failed to maintain adequate heat on a consistent basis.  
9.  Defendant knew or should have known that the heating system was old and inadequate but failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Premises were properly heated.  
10.  In order to maintain livable conditions, Plaintiff purchased two portable space heaters and incurred approximately **$150 per month** in additional electricity costs.  
11.  During January 2025, Plaintiff developed **bronchitis**, which her physician attributed in part to the persistently cold indoor temperatures, causing Plaintiff to miss three days of work and pay for medication.  
12.  Defendant minimized Plaintiff’s complaints and asserted that the heat was “working,” despite obvious evidence of substandard heating.  
13.  The recurring heating failures substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.  
14.  As a direct result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages estimated at **$900**, including excess utility payments, medical costs, loss of work income, and diminished habitability.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 14.  
16.  Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
17.  Defendant had a duty to maintain the Premises in a condition fit for human habitation, as established by **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, **G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127H**, and the **State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.**, which require that heating facilities be capable of maintaining at least 68°F from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and 64°F at night during the heating season.  
18.  Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat constituted an unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s failure to correct conditions creating substantial interference constitutes violation of G.L. c. 186, §14).  
19.  An intermittent loss of heat rises to the level of substantial interference under Massachusetts law. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (quiet enjoyment breached when landlord’s conduct indirectly prevented tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment).  
20.  The covenant of quiet enjoyment includes the landlord’s obligation to ensure that vital services such as heat are maintained. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
21.  Defendant’s failure to remedy the heating defect after notice constitutes willful or at least negligent interference. **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
22.  A landlord’s knowledge of poor conditions and failure to act can warrant treble damages under **G.L. c. 186, §14**. **Brown v. LeClair**, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985).  
23.  The tenant’s use of alternative heat sources and continuing residence do not waive the right to claim breach. **Khim v. Johnson**, 2010 Mass. App. Div. 238.  
24.  The covenant protects against conditions making the premises unfit for ordinary enjoyment. **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
25.  Defendant’s conduct, in failing to provide adequate and consistent heat despite repeated notifications, was intentional, willful, and unreasonable, constituting a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
26.  As a direct and proximate result of this breach, Plaintiff suffered actual damages including increased utility costs, medical expenses, lost wages, and discomfort.  
27.  Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and treble damages, costs, and attorney’s fees as provided by **G.L. c. 186, §14**.
