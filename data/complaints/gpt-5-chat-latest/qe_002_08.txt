### **COMPLAINT**

**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff **Samantha Johnson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 27 Maple Street, Basement Unit, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119. Plaintiff has rented and occupied the premises since March 1, 2022.  

2. Defendant **Linda Carver** (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the said premises located at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (“the Premises”).

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this action involves a residential tenancy within the City of Boston, Suffolk County.  

4. Venue is proper in the **Boston Housing Court**, as the property and the events giving rise to this action occurred within its territorial jurisdiction.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant beginning on or about March 1, 2022, for the basement apartment at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, with monthly rent of **$1,200**.  

6. Plaintiff consistently paid rent throughout her tenancy. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying rent due to unexpected medical expenses, but she subsequently paid the total rent owed along with the applicable late fee.  

7. In or around November 2025, Plaintiff noticed **water seeping through the basement wall** of the Premises whenever it rained heavily.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message, and Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but took **no remedial action** for several weeks.  

9. When the condition persisted, Plaintiff contacted the **City of Boston Inspectional Services Department**, which conducted an inspection. The inspection confirmed the water infiltration issue and cited additional housing code violations.  

10. The water intrusion caused property damage to Plaintiff’s belongings, including a rug and a bookshelf, resulting in approximately **$400 in losses**.  

11. Plaintiff has also incurred additional utility costs due to the continuous operation of a dehumidifier necessary to mitigate moisture and mold concerns.  

12. Following Plaintiff’s complaint to the City and the subsequent inspection, Defendant began referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and informed her that the lease would not be renewed when it expires in **March 2026**.  

13. Defendant has stated that the non-renewal is due to the previous late rent payment, but the timing of her actions strongly suggests **retaliation** for Plaintiff’s exercise of her right to report code violations and request repairs.  

14. The water infiltration remains unresolved, and the condition **substantially interferes with and diminishes the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** of the Premises.  

15. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered property damage, financial loss, emotional distress, and persistent interference with the beneficial use and enjoyment of her home.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**

#### **Count I — Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises. Violation of this covenant entitles the tenant to **actual and consequential damages**, or **three months’ rent**, whichever is greater, plus attorneys’ fees and costs.  

18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every Massachusetts leasehold interest.  
   - *See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  

19. Defendant’s failure to repair the water infiltration problem after notice from Plaintiff and from the city constitutes a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
   - *See Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord liability for failure to correct ongoing conditions interfering with tenant’s comfort and health).  

20. Continuous water intrusion and uninhabitable dampness render the premises unsafe and unfit for human habitation, violating **G.L. c. 111, § 127A**, **§ 127B**, and the **State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. § 410.000 et seq.**  
   - *See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  

21. A breach of the State Sanitary Code can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
   - *See McAllister v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300 (1999).  

22. Defendant’s apparent retaliatory conduct in refusing to renew Plaintiff’s lease after she reported housing code violations further constitutes indirect interference with quiet enjoyment in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, and violates the **anti-retaliation provisions of G.L. c. 186, § 18.**  
   - *See Spence v. O’Brien*, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  

23. Defendant’s conduct was willful, knowing, and taken in disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory and contractual rights.  

24. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover damages for the loss of her property, for diminished value of tenancy, and for distress and inconvenience resulting from Defendant’s unlawful interference.  
   - *See Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 378 Mass. 758 (1979); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

### **V. DAMAGES**

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breaches, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including, but not limited to:  

   a. **Property damage** to a rug and bookshelf, totaling approximately **$400**;  
   b. **Increased utility costs** of approximately $100 due to continuous dehumidifier operation;  
   c. **Loss of use and enjoyment** of the premises; and  
   d. **Emotional distress and inconvenience** from living in persistently damp, substandard conditions.  

26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to the greater of:  
   - Three (3) months’ rent ($1,200 × 3 = **$3,600**), or  
   - Actual and consequential damages.  

27. Plaintiff further requests reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to statute.
