### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Emily Johnson (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Emily Johnson is, upon information and belief, the owner and landlord of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603, a three-unit residential apartment building.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Worcester District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in Worcester County under G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the cause of action arose in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Defendant’s property giving rise to the injury is located there.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about February 10, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully present at 123 Maple Street in Worcester, Massachusetts, for the purpose of delivering groceries to one of Defendant’s tenants.  
6. The premises included a publicly accessible sidewalk for which Defendant, as the property owner, is responsible for maintenance, including snow and ice removal.  
7. After a winter snowstorm in early February 2023, Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the center of the sidewalk.  
8. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or any other de-icing material to the sidewalk after clearing the narrow path.  
9. In the days following the storm, the temperatures fluctuated, causing melting during the day and refreezing at night.  
10. As a result, the shoveled path developed into a sheet of hard, slippery ice across the sidewalk.  
11. Prior to February 10, 2023, tenants of the building reported the hazardous ice condition to Defendant by text message and provided photographs of the ice.  
12. Defendant replied, stating, “the sun will take care of it,” and declined to take further action to make the sidewalk safe.  
13. On February 10, 2023, Plaintiff entered the sidewalk in a careful and ordinary manner while delivering groceries.  
14. Plaintiff stepped onto the ice-covered portion of the sidewalk, lost her footing, and fell violently backward, striking her lower back on the hard ground.  
15. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain and sought medical attention.  
16. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a sprained lower back, requiring medical treatment and rest.  
17. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $1,200.00 and lost approximately $800.00 in wages due to missed work during her recovery.  
18. The sidewalk ice condition was open, obvious, and known to Defendant and was not reasonably addressed despite her statutory and common-law duties to maintain the premises in a safe condition.  
19. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and financial losses.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.  
21. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful visitor, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of the premises, including the sidewalk, pursuant to Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 84, § 17 and related provisions.  
22. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner who undertakes snow and ice removal must do so with reasonable care and cannot create or fail to remedy a hazardous condition that foreseeably endangers lawful visitors. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
23. Defendant breached this duty by failing to properly treat and maintain the sidewalk after shoveling, resulting in an accumulation of dangerous ice.  
24. Massachusetts law imposes a duty of reasonable care under all the circumstances on an owner or possessor of land. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973). Defendant’s disregard of tenants’ warnings and refusal to apply sand or salt constitutes a violation of that duty.  
25. Defendant was on notice of the dangerous condition as evidenced by tenant reports and photographs, satisfying both actual and constructive notice requirements under *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973), and *Thorson v. Mandell*, 402 Mass. 744 (1988).  
26. The failure to remediate the icy condition after actual notice constitutes negligence under *Aylward v. McCloskey*, 412 Mass. 77 (1992), and *Griffin v. General Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362 (1980).  
27. Defendant’s conduct was unreasonable and careless given the foreseeability of harm, contrary to the principles stated in *Jenco v. Town of Reading*, 380 Mass. 540 (1980), and *Souza v. Pratico*, 456 Mass. 1005 (2010).  
28. Pursuant to G.L. c. 84, §§ 15 and 17, landowners in control of abutting sidewalks have a statutory obligation not to permit unsafe accumulations of snow and ice that cause injury.  
29. Defendant’s failure to treat the sidewalk appropriately created and maintained an unreasonably dangerous condition, in violation of Massachusetts common law principles of negligence as articulated in *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980), and *Alter v. Newton*, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 142 (1993).  
30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, physical pain, medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress.  
31. Plaintiff has suffered damages in an amount to be determined at trial but reasonably estimated to exceed $2,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs.

## V. DAMAGES AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Enter judgment against Defendant Emily Johnson for negligence;  
2. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount deemed fair and just by the Court or jury, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
3. Award statutory interest and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
4. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
