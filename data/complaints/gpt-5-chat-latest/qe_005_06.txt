Civil Action No. ___________

# **COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Carter** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.  
2. The Defendant, **Robert Thompson** (“Defendant”), is an individual doing business as a residential landlord with an address upon information and belief at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144, and is the owner and manager of the subject premises.  

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 231, §§ 2 & 1**, as the amount in controversy is under $50,000 and the cause of action arose in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court because the premises at issue are located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  

---

## **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **January 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the second-floor apartment at **123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144**, for a monthly rent of **$1,800.**  
6. The written lease agreement expressly includes the **covenant of quiet enjoyment**, guaranteeing tenant protection from unreasonable interference by the landlord or those deriving their rights from him.  
7. Beginning approximately **June 2025**, new tenants moved into the third-floor apartment of the same property, also rented from Defendant.  
8. Since that time, those tenants have made continual loud noises — including stomping, late-night music, and moving furniture at late hours — significantly disrupting Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and use her home peacefully.  
9. Plaintiff made **at least five or six complaints** to Defendant about the persistent noise between June and November 2025.  
10. Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants only once and thereafter told Plaintiff he “can’t control how people live,” taking no further remedial action.  
11. The disturbances have continued daily and nightly, depriving Plaintiff of reasonable peace, comfort, and convenience in her apartment.  
12. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to remedy the situation, Plaintiff has averaged only **four to five hours of sleep per night**, has suffered health-related consequences including fatigue, sleep deprivation, and has incurred **$40 per month** in sleep medication costs prescribed by her physician.  
13. Plaintiff has purchased **earplugs** and a **white noise machine**, and has rearranged her sleeping area in an unsuccessful effort to mitigate the disturbance.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of her home, and economic loss due to medical costs and lost work performance.  
15. Plaintiff estimates her resulting damages at **approximately $1,200.**

## **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
### **Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease under Massachusetts law.  *See* **Winchester v. O’Brien**, 266 Mass. 33 (1929); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
19. Defendant, by failing to take reasonable steps to stop ongoing and unreasonable disturbances by another tenant on the property under his control, **indirectly interfered** with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  *See* **Doe v. Superintendent of Schools of Worcester**, 421 Mass. 117 (1995); **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
20. In **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when, through inaction or indifference, he permits disturbing conduct by tenants or others under his control that substantially interferes with another tenant’s use of the premises.  
21. Defendant’s failure to act after repeated complaints constitutes unreasonable and substantial interference in violation of the covenant.  *See* **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
22. The noise disturbances were continuous, foreseeable, and within Defendant’s ability to address, making his inaction legally attributable to him.  *See* **Winchester v. O’Brien**, supra; **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
23. Defendant’s conduct and omissions have deprived Plaintiff of “peaceful and quiet enjoyment” guaranteed by the lease and Massachusetts law.  *See* **Coughlan v. Grande & Son, Inc.**, 332 Mass. 464 (1955); **Haber v. Cohen**, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 627 (1984).  
24. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Defendant’s actions and omissions entitle Plaintiff to actual and consequential damages, and the Court may award **up to three months’ rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees** (though no fees are sought here as Plaintiff is self-represented).  
25. Defendant’s conduct has caused substantial emotional distress, sleeplessness, and financial harm to Plaintiff.

## **V. DAMAGES**

26. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered losses including:  
   a. Sleep deprivation and loss of health and well-being;  
   b. Emotional distress and anxiety;  
   c. Costs of medication and sleep aids averaging $40 per month;  
   d. Loss of work productivity and written warning at her place of employment;  
   e. Diminished value of tenancy and interference with peaceful use of her home.  
27. Plaintiff estimates her actual damages at **$1,200**, and she seeks relief as permitted under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** in an amount no less than the greater of three months’ rent or her actual damages as the Court deems just.  

---

## **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Robert Thompson**, and:

1. Award Plaintiff damages pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, including statutory damages equal to three months’ rent ($5,400) or actual damages, whichever is greater;  
2. Order Defendant to cease and desist from further interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises;  
3. Award any additional relief the Court deems just and proper, including costs of suit; and  
4. Grant such further equitable or monetary relief as justice requires.

## **VII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
