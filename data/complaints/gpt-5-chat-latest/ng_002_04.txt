### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on Hammond Pond Parkway in Newton, Massachusetts—a public park and recreational area.  
7. The City of Newton posts visible signs in the park stating that all dogs must be kept on leashes at all times.  
8. On that date, Defendant was present in the same park with his large dog, which he allowed to run loose without a leash.  
9. Defendant held the dog’s leash over his shoulder but did not attach it to the dog, in violation of City of Newton Leash Law, *Newton Revised Ordinances, Ch. 3, § 3-52*.  
10. As Plaintiff jogged past, Defendant’s unleashed dog suddenly charged at her, barking aggressively.  
11. Defendant was approximately thirty feet away, talking with friends, and made no immediate effort to restrain the dog.  
12. Fearing she was about to be bitten, Plaintiff instinctively swerved to her right off the running path to avoid the charging dog.  
13. In doing so, Plaintiff’s foot caught on an exposed tree root, causing her to fall down a small embankment.  
14. Plaintiff struck the ground forcefully and suffered a fractured wrist as a result of the fall.  
15. The dog did not physically touch Plaintiff, but its behavior caused Plaintiff to take evasive action that directly resulted in her injury.  
16. Several witnesses observed the incident and confirmed that Defendant’s dog was unleashed and that Defendant was inattentive at the time.  
17. Plaintiff sought immediate treatment at a local emergency room, incurring approximately **$4,500** in medical expenses.  
18. Plaintiff was medically required to wear a brace for several weeks, was unable to work for a period of time, and lost approximately **$1,200** in wages.  
19. Plaintiff also lost the opportunity to perform in a piano recital for which she had been preparing, causing significant emotional distress, frustration, and loss of enjoyment of life.  
20. Defendant’s failure to maintain control of his animal constituted negligence and a breach of his duty of reasonable care.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

21. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
22. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006).  
23. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to control his dog and keep it on a leash, consistent with both common law duties of reasonable care and municipal ordinances. See *Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 283 Mass. 158, 161 (1933); *Whalen v. Shivek*, 326 Mass. 142, 149 (1950).  
24. Defendant breached this duty by allowing his dog to roam at large, setting in motion events that made Plaintiff’s injury foreseeable.  
25. Massachusetts courts recognize that an owner’s failure to restrain an animal constitutes actionable negligence where injury results. See *Foley v. F. W. Woolworth Co.*, 293 Mass. 232 (1936); *Maillet v. Mininno*, 266 Mass. 86 (1929).  
26. The City of Newton’s leash law, *Newton Revised Ordinances, Ch. 3, § 3-52*, creates a statutory standard of care, and violation thereof is evidence of negligence. See *Breen v. Burns*, 280 Mass. 222, 226 (1932); *G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–158*.  
27. Defendant’s conduct was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Proximate cause exists where the harm is a reasonably foreseeable result of the defendant’s act. See *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).  
28. Plaintiff’s response—swerving to avoid the charging dog—was a natural reaction to Defendant’s negligence and does not constitute comparative fault. See *Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.*, 388 Mass. 342, 355 (1983).  
29. Even though the dog did not physically contact Plaintiff, Defendant’s negligence in failing to restrain his dog foreseeably caused Plaintiff to suffer injury. See *McCusker v. Spier*, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (2008) (Rule 1:28 decision) (owner liable where victim’s evasive response to dog’s behavior caused injury).  
30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained serious personal injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional harm.  
31. Plaintiff’s economic losses include, but are not limited to, approximately $4,500 in medical costs and $1,200 in lost wages.  
32. Plaintiff also suffered noneconomic damages including physical pain, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and interference with her normal activities.  
33. Defendant’s negligence violated established Massachusetts principles of reasonable care, including those articulated in *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973), *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84, 88 (1988), and *Jenkins v. Rainear*, 371 Mass. 293 (1976).  
34. Plaintiff reserves her right to amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence as discovery develops.
