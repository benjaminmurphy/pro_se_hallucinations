### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully present at Defendant’s restaurant, Sunny Bistro, located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  

6. While Plaintiff was dining, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.  

7. The server gathered the pieces of broken glass but left a visible puddle of water and ice on the ceramic tile floor, stating she would “be right back with a mop.”  

8. The server failed to place a “wet floor” sign or any other warning device alerting patrons to the hazardous condition.  

9. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose from his table to use the restroom, which required him to pass through the same hallway.  

10. The puddle of water and ice remained on the floor, unmarked and unaddressed by staff.  

11. Plaintiff, exercising reasonable care, nevertheless stepped on the wet surface, slipped, and twisted his right knee, suffering significant pain and injury.  

12. After the fall, Plaintiff overheard other staff members remark that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time, indicating that the Defendant’s employees had actual or constructive knowledge of the unsafe condition.  

13. Plaintiff sought prompt medical treatment at a local urgent care facility and was diagnosed with a severe knee sprain requiring the use of a brace and weeks of physical therapy.  

14. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,800 and sustained wage loss of approximately $500 due to his inability to work.  

15. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent knee pain, discomfort, and limitations in mobility.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Defendant, as the owner and operator of Sunny Bistro, owed a duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors, to remedy hazards of which it knew or should have known, and to warn invitees of any danger which it could not immediately correct.  
   - See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowner owes reasonable care to all lawful visitors).
   - **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 371‑72 (2010) (property owners liable for failure to remedy or warn of known hazards).  

18. Defendant breached its duty by:  
   a. Failing to promptly clean up the spilled water and ice;  
   b. Failing to inspect and monitor the area for ongoing hazards;  
   c. Failing to warn customers of the dangerous condition; and  
   d. Allowing the hazard to persist for over ten minutes despite actual notice.  

19. Defendant’s employees acted within the scope of their employment, making Defendant vicariously liable under the doctrine of **respondeat superior**.  
   - See **Worcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc.**, 408 Mass. 393, 404 (1990).  

20. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the duty of ordinary care owed to business invitees under **Massachusetts common law of premises liability**.  
   - **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165, 167‑68 (1973).  
   - **Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.**, 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955).  
   - **Ventura v. Cumberland Farms, Inc.**, 438 Mass. 527, 529‑30 (2003).  

21. The dangerous condition existed for such a time that Defendant, exercising reasonable care, should have discovered and removed it.  
   - **DeSarno v. Worcester**, 360 Mass. 127, 130 (1971).  
   - **Thurlow v. Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc.**, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 177‑78 (2000).  

22. Defendant failed to maintain its premises in a condition reasonably safe for invitees, in violation of its duty as articulated in **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and related common law principles.  

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other economic and noneconomic damages.  

24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover the full measure of damages permitted under **Massachusetts tort law**, including **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6F**, which permit interest and costs in actions for personal injuries.
