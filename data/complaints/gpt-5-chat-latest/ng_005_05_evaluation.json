The court instead addresses duty and scope-of-liability questions in a medical-provider/third\u2011party context and ultimately finds no duty and no causation as a matter of law. Thus, it cannot fairly be cited as authority that a particular homeowner\u2019s conduct was not that of a reasonably prudent homeowner under similar circumstances or that such conduct constitutes negligence under \u00a7 85 and Massachusetts common law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo prevail on his negligence claims, Leavitt must prove that the hospital owed him a duty of reasonable care, that the hospital committed a breach of that duty, that damage resulted, and that there was a causal relation between the breach of duty and the damage. \u2026 The hospital argues that the motion judge correctly dismissed the complaint because Leavitt cannot establish the first element, duty, as a matter of law.
