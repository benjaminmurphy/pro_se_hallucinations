**Plaintiff, Jason Smith (“Plaintiff”),** brings this negligence action against **Defendant, Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”)**, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jason Smith (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and the father and natural guardian of his eight‑year‑old son (“minor child”), who suffered the injuries described below.  

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation with a principal business address at 45 Thatcher Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4** (granting jurisdiction to the Superior Court in civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000).  

4. Venue is proper in Bristol County pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the acts and omissions giving rise to this complaint occurred within this county.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Defendant operates an after‑school program at its community center facility located at 45 Thatcher Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  

6. Defendant represents to parents and guardians that children enrolled in its after-school program will be supervised “at all times,” including while using the gymnasium.  

7. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s minor child was participating in the program’s gym period along with approximately twenty other children.  

8. Pursuant to Defendant’s policies, two staff members were supposed to supervise the children in the gym.  

9. On that date, one staff member left the gym to do administrative paperwork in the office, leaving a single staff member to supervise approximately twenty children.  

10. The sole remaining staff member spent much of the time seated near the bleachers, using or looking at her cell phone, and failed to monitor the activities of the children.  

11. Two older boys, approximately age twelve, began roughhousing and playing a tackle‑style game on the hardwood floor.  

12. Several children complained to the staff member about the unsafe behavior, but she dismissed the concerns, responding “boys will be boys.”  

13. Shortly thereafter, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s eight‑year‑old son, causing him to fall backward and strike his head forcefully against the hardwood floor.  

14. Plaintiff’s son lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and was subsequently transported to a local emergency department, where he was diagnosed with a **concussion**.  

15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$4,500** in medical expenses for emergency treatment, follow‑up visits, and related care.  

16. As a result of this head injury, Plaintiff’s minor child missed several days of school, endured pain and suffering, and experienced ongoing headaches and confusion following the incident.  

17. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate supervision, failure to maintain a safe environment, and failure to act upon warnings from other children directly and proximately caused the injury to Plaintiff’s child.

---

### III. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, a duty of reasonable care exists where one undertakes the supervision of children, particularly when representing that professional childcare or after‑school supervision will be provided. See **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc., 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002)**.  

20. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff’s minor child to exercise reasonable care in supervising him and maintaining a safe environment while under its care and custody.  

21. This duty arises under **common-law principles of negligence** and the **standard of reasonable care** codified and recognized in **Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983)**, which holds that institutions undertaking supervision of minors must take reasonable precautions to protect them from foreseeable harm.  

22. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to ensure proper staff-to-child ratios;  
   b. Allowing one staff member to leave despite known supervision obligations;  
   c. Permitting unsafe horseplay to continue after being alerted;  
   d. Failing to enforce safety rules and monitor the gym; and  
   e. Failing to intervene in time to prevent foreseeable injury.

23. Under **Fiorentino v. Probate Court Dept., 417 Mass. 491 (1994)**, one who undertakes the protection of others and fails to do so adequately is subject to tort liability if injury results that was reasonably foreseeable.  

24. The assault or rough play that caused Plaintiff’s child’s injury was a foreseeable risk of neglecting adequate supervision, as recognized in **Barnett v. Lynn, 433 Mass. 662 (2001)** and **Andres v. Town of Waterboro, 425 Mass. 688 (1997)**.  

25. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the **duty of reasonable supervision** recognized in **Foster v. The Loft, Inc., 26 Mass. App. Ct. 289 (1988)** (holding that establishments owe a duty to protect invitees from foreseeable harm resulting from third-party acts).  

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s minor child suffered personal injuries, including a concussion, pain, and emotional distress, and Plaintiff incurred medical expenses.  

27. Massachusetts law holds that a parent may recover medical expenses and loss of the child’s services under **G.L. c. 231, § 85X**, and health care providers may recover through this section when negligence of others causes injury to a minor.  

28. Defendant’s failure to follow its own safety policies and its misrepresentations regarding continuous supervision constitute additional evidence of breach. See **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37 (2009)** (holding that a defendant’s own protocols may establish the standard of reasonable care).  

29. Plaintiff and his son have suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Past and future medical expenses estimated at **$4,500** and likely to increase with future care;  
   b. Physical pain and suffering of the minor child;  
   c. Emotional distress and mental anguish; and  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life and disruption of normal activities.  

30. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest from the date of the filing of this Complaint.

### IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jason Smith respectfully demands judgment against Defendant Brockton Community Center as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount reasonable and just, believed to exceed **Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00)**;  
B. For reimbursement of medical expenses totaling approximately **$4,500**, subject to proof at trial;  
C. For prejudgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
D. For costs and reasonable expenses of suit; and  
E. For such other and further relief as this Court deems proper and just.

---

### V. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
