2. Defendant, **Thomas Green**, is an individual and the owner and landlord of the property located at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 (“the Premises”).

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to lease a residential unit at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $2,500.  
6. Defendant, as landlord, covenanted that Plaintiff would have quiet enjoyment of the Premises as required by Massachusetts General Laws c. 186 §14.  
7. Beginning around **October 1, 2025**, Defendant commenced extensive renovation work on the adjacent unit within the same building.  
8. The construction has included **continuous drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by workers** from approximately 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. on weekdays.  
9. The construction activity has persisted for **over two months**, with the landlord indicating it may continue for an additional month or more.  
10. During this time, Plaintiff, who **works from home**, has been **unable to conduct business calls or concentrate** due to the persistent noise and disturbance.  
11. Dust from the construction has entered Plaintiff’s unit through the ventilation system on multiple occasions.  
12. Although Defendant offered a **small rent reduction of $100 for one month**, the disruption has continued unabated and remains substantial.  
13. Plaintiff has repeatedly expressed concerns to Defendant about the noise and dust, but the interference has not materially abated.  
14. The level and duration of construction activity have **substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.**  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered **inconvenience, loss of use, diminished quiet enjoyment, stress, and loss of work productivity.**  
16. Plaintiff estimates the total damages resulting from this interference to be **no less than $3,000**.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186 §14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 186 §14**, a landlord is prohibited from interfering, directly or indirectly, with the quiet enjoyment of a tenant’s premises.  
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from disturbances arising from the acts or omissions of the landlord or those acting under his direction.  
20. The excessive noise, dust, and disruption caused by Defendant’s renovation activities have **substantially interfered** with Plaintiff’s ability to peacefully occupy the Premises.  
21. The interference complained of was foreseeable and avoidable by Defendant through reasonable measures, such as limiting noise levels, mitigating dust infiltration, or temporarily relocating Plaintiff during disruptive periods.  
22. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a **breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment** under Massachusetts law.
