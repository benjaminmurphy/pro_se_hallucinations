(Negligence)

Plaintiff **Jordan Miller** (“Plaintiff”), hereby brings this Complaint against **Alex Chen** (“Defendant”), and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Miller is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Alex Chen is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and at all relevant times operated or controlled a motor vehicle within Suffolk County.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, which grants the Superior Court original jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County under **G.L. c. 223, § 2** because the tort occurred in Boston, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **July 15, 2023**, at approximately 8:15 a.m., Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bicycle lane on Park Drive near 200 Park Drive, Boston, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff was obeying all applicable traffic laws, riding within the designated lane, and wearing a helmet.  
7. Defendant, operating as a rideshare driver, parked a vehicle adjacent to the bicycle lane in a loading zone.  
8. Without checking for oncoming cyclists or ensuring that it was safe to open his door, Defendant suddenly swung open the driver’s side door directly into the bicycle lane.  
9. Plaintiff, with no opportunity to evade or stop safely, collided with the open door and was thrown from the bicycle, striking the pavement.  
10. As a direct result, Plaintiff sustained **road rash on both arms and legs**, a **chipped front tooth**, and **damage to the bicycle frame**.  
11. At the scene, Defendant admitted he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone.  
12. Defendant’s later assertion to his insurer that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic” is false. Plaintiff remained entirely within the designated bike lane.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical and dental expenses and **$600** in lost wages due to missed work.  
14. Plaintiff also incurred property damage to his bicycle and associated gear.  
15. All injuries and losses were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s carelessness, recklessness, and violation of Massachusetts traffic and safety laws.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, every motorist owes a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation of a motor vehicle to avoid foreseeable harm to others on the roadway, including bicyclists. See **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401 (1991); **G.L. c. 90, § 14**.  
18. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care when parking and exiting his vehicle, including the duty to ensure that no bicyclist or other road user would be endangered by opening his door. See **Schofield v. Merrill**, 386 Mass. 244 (1982); **G.L. c. 90, § 14** (“No person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so”).  
19. Defendant breached this duty of care by:  
   a. Opening his vehicle door into an active traffic lane without ensuring it was safe;  
   b. Failing to maintain a proper lookout;  
   c. Failing to yield to a bicyclist lawfully traveling in a marked bicycle lane; and  
   d. Distracted driving while using his phone.  
20. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  
21. Plaintiff exercised due care for his own safety at all relevant times.  
22. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, emotional distress, property damage, medical expenses, lost earnings, and pain and suffering.  

Relevant Massachusetts authorities establishing Defendant’s liability include:  
- **G.L. c. 90, § 14** (duty to park and open doors safely).  
- **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence).  
- **G.L. c. 231, § 60B** (medical injury not applicable here but confirming the tort standard).  
- **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401 (1991) (reasonable person standard).  
- **Schofield v. Merrill**, 386 Mass. 244 (1982) (duty of care to avoid foreseeable harm).  
- **Lancaster v. Norfolk & Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co.**, 440 Mass. 14 (2003) (proximate cause).  
- **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty arises from foreseeable risk of harm).  
- **Davis v. Allard**, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 508 (1994) (negligence and comparative fault analysis).  
- **Coughlin v. Pitney**, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 942 (1996) (motorist’s door opening negligence).  
- **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (duty defined by foreseeability).
