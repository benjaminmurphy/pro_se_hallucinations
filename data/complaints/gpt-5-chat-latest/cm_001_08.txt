Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL DAVIS,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

#### INTRODUCTION

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”)**, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **April 15, 2021** in the above-captioned matter. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the current parenting schedule based on a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that affects the welfare of the minor children, **Emily Davis (age 8)** and **Jacob Davis (age 6)**.

---

#### PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff Jessica Thompson**, mother of the minor children, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is **(617) 555‑0123**, and her email address is **psm1443@gmail.com**.

2. **Defendant Michael Davis**, father of the minor children, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

---

#### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, as this matter concerns modification of a custody order originally issued by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court.  

4. Venue lies properly in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court**, as both parties and the children reside within Middlesex County.

---

#### BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER

5. On **April 15, 2021**, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court issued a Judgment or Temporary Order establishing custody and parenting time between the parties.  

6. Under that Order, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, was granted **primary custody** of the parties’ minor children.  

7. The Defendant, **Michael Davis**, was granted **parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week.**  

8. At the time of that Order, both parents were employed in **regular daytime work schedules**, and the arrangement was consistent with the children’s best interests.

---

#### MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since the entry of the 2021 Order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that affects the children’s welfare and the feasibility of the current parenting plan.  

10. Specifically, in or around **mid‑2025**, the Defendant accepted new employment requiring him to work overnight shifts from **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM**, multiple nights per week—including many of the nights that coincide with his scheduled overnight parenting time.  

11. The Defendant has repeatedly been **unable to personally care for or supervise** the children on these overnight occasions due to fatigue following his shifts or because of conflicting work hours.  

12. On multiple occasions, the Defendant has **returned the children to the Plaintiff’s home with little or no notice** because he was unable to provide proper care after overnight work.  

13. On other occasions, he has **left the children in the care of his roommate**, a person the Plaintiff does not know and whose qualifications to supervise minor children are unknown.  

14. The children have reported that they often sleep on the couch at Defendant’s home while he naps following work, indicating insufficient adult supervision and disruption to their normal routine.  

15. These circumstances represent a **substantial change** affecting the children’s safety, stability, and best interests. The current schedule is no longer workable, given the Defendant’s new employment schedule and resulting inability to exercise overnights consistently or safely.  

16. Continuation of the present custody and parenting time order under these changed circumstances would be contrary to the **best interests of the children** as required by **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31**.

---

#### LEGAL STANDARDS AND AUTHORITIES

17. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a court may modify a custody or parenting time judgment if there has occurred a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties and if modification is necessary in the **best interests of the children**.  

18. See **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (modification proper where change affects child’s best interests).  

19. See also **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (court must consider changed circumstances and best interests when revisiting parenting schedule).  

20. In **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), the Appeals Court held that modification of custody may be appropriate when one parent’s new employment schedule interferes with the children’s stability and routine.  

21. **Custody of Viera**, 442 Mass. 690 (2004), recognized the central duty of the court to ensure a child’s safety and consistency when evaluating material changes in a parent’s circumstances.  

22. **Birchall, petitioner**, 454 Mass. 837 (2009), emphasizes the trial court’s broad equitable power to revise custody orders in light of evolving family circumstances.  

23. **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981), held that nocturnal work schedules may justify modification when such employment materially interferes with parental obligations.  

24. **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), establishes that parental fitness and ability to meet children’s needs remain controlling factors in best‑interest determinations.  

25. **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015), reiterates that stability of care and consistency of parental availability are crucial in custody modifications.  

26. See also **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (modification justified where original custody arrangement no longer serves child’s welfare).  

27. As these authorities reflect, modification under the present facts—a parental work change substantially interfering with overnight care—squarely satisfies the statutory threshold for relief.
