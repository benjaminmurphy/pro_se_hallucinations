---

## **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This action is brought pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, **c. 209, §§ 37–38**, and **c. 215, § 6**, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify prior judgments relating to custody and visitation upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that modification is in the best interests of the child.  

5. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court**, as both parties reside within Bristol County and the original custody order was entered by this Court on **May 15, 2018**.  

---

## **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

6. On May 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment of custody providing that the parties share **50/50 physical custody** of their minor child, Emily Thompson, on an **alternating weekly basis**.  

7. At the time of the original order, both parents lived nearby, enjoyed good health, and were equally able to meet all of the child’s physical and emotional needs.  

8. For several years, the shared arrangement worked successfully; Emily developed consistent routines in both homes and performed well academically and socially.  

9. However, since the entry of the original order, there has been a **significant and material change in circumstances**: the Defendant, **James Thompson**, has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that materially affects his physical abilities and capacity to care for Emily safely.  

10. The Defendant’s condition has resulted in multiple falls at home and an increased need for physical assistance in daily life.  

11. The Defendant’s treating physician has expressly advised that he should **not be alone with the child** in situations requiring quick physical response or where ambulation near stairs or other hazards is involved.  

12. Despite this medical guidance, the Defendant insists upon continuing the alternating weekly schedule without modification. During those weeks, Emily has been required to assist her father with physically demanding tasks, including helping transfer him from a wheelchair to bed and bringing him necessary items throughout the house.  

13. These circumstances place **inappropriate caregiving burdens** upon Emily, who is only twelve years old, exposing her to emotional stress, potential physical risk, and responsibilities far beyond what is age‑appropriate.  

14. The Plaintiff believes that the existing custody order no longer serves the **best interests of the child**, as defined by **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, and that a modification providing for **primary physical custody** with the Plaintiff, with parenting time for the Defendant consistent with his medical limitations, is now necessary.  

---

## **LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

15. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209, §§ 37–38**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the previous judgment and where the modification is in the child’s best interests.  

16. A parent’s substantial change in health or capacity to care for the child constitutes a recognized basis for modification. See **Cooper v. Cooper, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 864 (2021)** (health deterioration and capacity to supervise child warranted reconsideration of prior custody order).  

17. The “best interests of the child” standard remains paramount. See **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985)**; **Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406 (1976)**.  

18. Courts have held that when an existing custody order no longer adequately protects the welfare of the minor child, modification is required. **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006)**.  

19. The presence of a parent’s chronic illness that materially affects caregiving capacity may justify modification where the schedule endangers or burdens a child. **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.  

20. The Court has broad equitable powers under **G.L. c. 215, § 6** to act in furtherance of the welfare of the child. See **Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998)**.  

21. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that stability, safety, and the child’s emotional well‑being are key factors in assessing best interests. **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**; **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**.  

22. The Plaintiff’s requested modification comports with the statutory and judicial principle that custody should ensure safety and consistent parental care. **Care and Protection of Zita, 455 Mass. 272, 279–80 (2009)**; **Custody of Eleanor, 414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993)**.  

23. Under **Massachusetts Domestic Relations Procedure**, a request for modification must allege and prove: (1) change in circumstances, and (2) best interests. Those elements are satisfied here due to Defendant’s physical limitations and the consequential risk to the child.

## **PROPOSED MODIFICATION**

24. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the current Judgment be modified as follows:  

   a. The Plaintiff, **Laura Thompson**, shall have **primary physical custody** of Emily Thompson.  
   
   b. The Defendant, **James Thompson**, shall have **liberal parenting time** as medically appropriate and as agreed upon by the parties, including supervised visitation if necessary for safety.  
   
   c. Both parents shall continue to share **legal custody** and jointly make major decisions regarding Emily’s education, health care, and religious upbringing, consistent with existing law.  
   
   d. The parties shall cooperate in good faith and attend family counseling or parenting coordination, if recommended by the Court, to ensure smooth transition and minimize disruption for Emily.

## **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Laura Thompson**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order;  
2. Find that modification of the order will serve the **best interests of Emily Thompson**;  
3. Enter a new order granting the Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of Emily Thompson, with appropriate parenting time for the Defendant;  
4. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
