The court explains that the accident would not have happened but for the inoperative interlocks and governor and affirms that the defendants are liable to the injured elevator passengers and operator, thus recognizing a direct causal link between the negligence and plaintiffs\u2019 damages. While the case is not phrased in terms of the formulaic words 'direct and proximate cause,' the causation analysis functionally supports that proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There was expert opinion evidence that the accident happened because one of the contact boxes became unfastened and fell into the pit, lodging in the mechanism and severing the cables. Had the interlock system been operating, the cab would have been immobilized when the contact box fell and the accident could not have happened. Nor could it have occurred had the governor been in working order. ... There was ample evidence, which we need not repeat, of [Bay State\u2019s] negligence in inspecting and maintaining the elevator. The plaintiffs ... were unquestionably within the class of persons likely to be injured by its negligence."

While the opinion discusses foreseeability of hazards from a self\u2011service produce setup, it does not establish any specific, well\u2011settled Massachusetts principle about harm from improperly stacked merchandise as such.

It does not involve merchandise shelving, falling boxes, customer contact with store fixtures, or foreseeability of such incidents in a retail context.
