v.  
**MARCUS GREENFIELD,**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. __________**

---

### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

#### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff**, Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Plaintiff has been a lawful tenant of the subject premises since June 1, 2022, pursuant to a rental agreement with the defendant.

2. **Defendant**, Marcus Greenfield (“Defendant”), is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Plaintiff currently resides.

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3 and G.L. c. 218, § 19C, as this action arises under the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth and concerns a residential tenancy located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court because the leased premises at issue—the residential unit located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts—are situated within Middlesex County and within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department.

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for a residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

6. The agreed monthly rent under the lease is $2,200, to be paid by Plaintiff to Defendant.

7. Beginning in or about October 2025, Defendant caused or allowed major renovation and construction activities to occur in the apartment unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s dwelling.

8. The construction work has included extensive drilling, hammering, and other loud noise, typically occurring from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.

9. The level and nature of the noise have interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment, particularly given that Plaintiff works from home and must conduct virtual meetings and business calls.

10. Construction has continued for approximately two months and is expected to persist for one to two additional months.

11. Dust and debris have migrated into Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system during this period of construction, exacerbating the interference with her quiet enjoyment.

12. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of these conditions and their adverse effects.

13. Defendant offered Plaintiff a one-time rent reduction of approximately $100, which Plaintiff accepted under protest as inadequate.

14. Despite such notice, Defendant allowed the disruptive conditions—including excessive noise and dust—to continue unabated for an extended duration.

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her dwelling, distress, inconvenience, and diminished rental value of the premises.

16. Plaintiff estimates that she has sustained damages in the amount of approximately $2,000.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully stated herein.

18. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant that the tenant shall have the quiet enjoyment of the premises for the term of the lease. *See* **G.L. c. 186, § 14**; *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of their leased premises caused by the landlord or by acts authorized or tolerated by the landlord. *See* *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman*, 417 Mass. 771 (1994).

20. Defendant, by permitting and authorizing prolonged construction activities involving persistent and excessive noise and dust, substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, in direct violation of the covenant.

21. Defendant’s constructive acts—authorizing extensive renovations and failing to mitigate their effects—constitute a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

22. The presence of disruptive noise and dust caused by Defendant’s construction project rendered the premises partially unsuitable for the ordinary and lawful purposes intended, violating *G.L. c. 186, § 14* and the implied covenant under *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

23. The length and intensity of the construction—continuing daily for multiple months without adequate mitigation—distinguish it as a substantial, not trivial, interference within the meaning of *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

24. Defendant had notice of the conditions and failed to take reasonable steps to remedy them, in violation of *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

25. Defendant’s offer of a nominal rent reduction does not absolve or mitigate his legal responsibility for the ongoing breach. *See* *Sargent v. Tenaska, Inc.*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (1989) (landlord’s after-the-fact offer does not cure a continuing violation).

26. Excessive noise and dust from construction, when permitted by a landlord, constitute a material interference with enjoyment within the meaning of *Lezberg v. Rogers*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1158 (1989).

27. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover her actual damages, including a reasonable sum for loss of use and diminution in rental value, under *G.L. c. 186, § 14* and *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

28. In addition to actual damages, *G.L. c. 186, § 14* authorizes the recovery of either actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

#### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Marcus Greenfield, and grant the following relief:

A. Finding that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under *G.L. c. 186, § 14*;  
B. Awarding Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $2,000, or alternatively, three months’ rent ($6,600), whichever is greater, pursuant to statute;  
C. Awarding Plaintiff her costs of this action;  
D. Awarding reasonable attorneys’ fees as provided by *G.L. c. 186, § 14* (if applicable to pro se litigants or future representation); and  
E. Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

#### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
