3. The events giving rise to this Complaint occurred at approximately 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, within the jurisdictional boundaries of Suffolk County.  
4. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 212, § 3**, the Superior Court Department of the Trial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has jurisdiction over this matter because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully riding a bicycle to work in a marked bicycle lane along Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.  
7. The bicycle lane was clearly designated as such by appropriate pavement markings and signage, and Plaintiff was complying with all traffic rules and safety regulations, including wearing a helmet.  
8. At or near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Defendant, who was operating a motor vehicle being used for rideshare services, parked in a loading zone adjacent to the bicycle lane.  
9. Without first ascertaining that it was safe to do so, Defendant suddenly opened the driver’s side door into the bicycle lane directly in the path of Plaintiff’s moving bicycle.  
10. Defendant failed to check his mirrors or blind spot before opening his door, in violation of his legal duty and in contravention of commonly accepted driving practices and Massachusetts law.  
11. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision and struck the edge of Defendant’s opened door with substantial force, causing Plaintiff to be thrown from his bicycle onto the pavement.  
12. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff suffered multiple injuries, including but not limited to road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and a bent bicycle frame.  
13. At the scene, Defendant admitted he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone.  
14. Plaintiff subsequently filed a claim with Defendant’s automobile insurer, but Defendant falsely alleged to his insurer that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” contrary to the facts and eyewitness accounts.  
15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in necessary medical expenses, including dental work, and suffered approximately **$800** in lost wages as a direct result of the injuries sustained.  
16. Plaintiff also incurred property damage to his bicycle, which required replacement.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–16 above as though fully set forth herein.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, all motorists owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others using the roadways, including bicyclists. See **Massaletti v. Fitzroy**, 228 Mass. 487, 489 (1917); **Glidden v. Maglio,** 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  
19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation and use of his motor vehicle, including the duty to ensure it was safe before opening his vehicle door into a lane of travel. See **M.G.L. c. 90, § 14** (prohibiting drivers from opening doors unless it is safe to do so).  
20. Defendant breached his duty of care by opening his car door into the bicycle lane without verifying that the adjacent lane was clear of oncoming bicyclists, in violation of **M.G.L. c. 90, § 14** and the standards articulated in **Carter v. Towne**, 98 Mass. App. Ct. 458 (2020).  
21. Defendant’s conduct constituted negligence as defined in **Uloth v. City Tank Corp.**, 376 Mass. 874, 879 (1978) (reasonable person standard of care).  
22. Defendant’s failure to keep a proper lookout and to refrain from distracted behavior—such as engaging with his cellphone—further falls below the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent driver. See **Lynn v. Lynn**, 302 Mass. 565, 566 (1939); **Gorey v. Guarente**, 303 Mass. 569, 571 (1939).  
23. Plaintiff’s resulting injuries were a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence. See **Craig v. Everett M. Brooks Co.**, 351 Mass. 497, 501 (1967) (proximate cause standard).  
24. The type and manner of harm suffered by Plaintiff were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s actions. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (foreseeability governs duty and causation).  
25. Plaintiff exercised ordinary care at all relevant times, obeying traffic signals, wearing safety equipment, and proceeding within a designated bicycle lane.  
26. Defendant’s negligence was the sole and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s bodily injuries, emotional distress, lost wages, and property damage. See **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (elements of negligence).  
27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages including medical expenses, loss of earnings, pain and suffering, and property damage.  
28. Plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages under **M.G.L. c. 231, § 85**, as well as all other applicable Massachusetts common and statutory law remedies.

### IV. DAMAGES

29. Plaintiff has incurred the following damages as a direct result of the Defendant’s negligence:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately **$2,500**;  
   b. Lost wages totaling approximately **$800**;  
   c. The cost of replacing a damaged bicycle frame;  
   d. Physical pain and emotional suffering;  
   e. Dental repair costs for a chipped tooth.  
30. Plaintiff therefore seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, together with pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and any other relief deemed proper by this Court.
