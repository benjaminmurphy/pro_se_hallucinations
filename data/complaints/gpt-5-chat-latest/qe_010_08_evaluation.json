Al\u2011Ziab does not involve mold, leaks, or vermin; it concerns lead paint and addresses whether a statutory violation, without proof of landlord fault, automatically violates \u00a714. The court holds that at least negligent conduct with notice is required and that a statutory violation alone is insufficient.
