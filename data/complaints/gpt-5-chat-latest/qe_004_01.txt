**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
_________________________________________  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff **Maria Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603, where she rents an apartment from the Defendant. Plaintiff may be reached at (617) 555‑0123 or by email at psm1433@gmail.com.  

2. Defendant **John Carter** (“Defendant”) is an individual with a principal address upon information and belief in Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises at issue in this action.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as the amount in controversy is less than $25,000 and the property is located within Worcester County.  

4. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and G.L. c. 239, as the leased premises are situated at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), for a monthly rent of $1,200.  

6. As part of the rental arrangement, Defendant, as landlord, was obligated to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. §§ 410.000 et seq., and to ensure Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment as guaranteed by G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

7. Beginning approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint—around September 2025—Plaintiff noticed evidence of a rodent infestation in the Premises, including mouse droppings regularly found in the kitchen area.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation.  

9. Defendant responded by placing a few mouse traps in the kitchen. A small number of mice were caught, but the infestation persisted.  

10. Plaintiff continued to observe mouse droppings and requested that Defendant take further remedial measures.  

11. Defendant, however, insisted the problem was “normal for older buildings” and stated that Plaintiff should “keep [her] kitchen cleaner,” implying that the condition resulted from Plaintiff’s housekeeping rather than a structural infestation.  

12. Defendant hired an exterminator on one occasion, who treated the Premises but indicated that the building required comprehensive and repeated treatment to eliminate the infestation.  

13. Despite this advice, Defendant declined to authorize additional extermination services, claiming that such steps were “too expensive” and unnecessary.  

14. The infestation continues to affect Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. Plaintiff finds mouse droppings on a weekly basis and fears contamination of food and cooking surfaces.  

15. As a result of the continuing rodent problem, Plaintiff has discarded approximately $200 worth of food and expended approximately $80 on sealed storage containers, totaling $280 in direct monetary loss.  

16. Plaintiff has also suffered inconvenience, stress, and anxiety due to the unsanitary condition of her home.  

17. Defendant’s failure to adequately abate the infestation and to maintain the Premises in compliance with sanitary standards has rendered the Premises unfit for ordinary use as a dwelling.  

**COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord “shall not, directly or indirectly, interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”  

20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees that a tenant’s possession and use of rented premises will not be substantially interfered with by the acts or omissions of the landlord. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

21. A continuing rodent infestation that the landlord fails to remedy after notice constitutes a substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Doe v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 404 Mass. 924 (1989) (pervasive conditions affecting habitability may breach covenant of quiet enjoyment); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  

22. Massachusetts law further requires landlords to maintain dwellings “free from infestation of insects, rodents, and other pests,” 105 C.M.R. § 410.550, and assigns the duty of extermination to the owner of any dwelling containing two or more units per 105 C.M.R. § 410.560(A).  

23. Failure to comply with the State Sanitary Code constitutes evidence of interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  

24. Where the interference is not merely transient or trivial, a violation arises even without proof of malice. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

25. Defendant’s failure to adequately address the rodent infestation despite repeated notice from Plaintiff constitutes a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized in Massachusetts common law. *See* *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).  

26. Plaintiff’s experience—being unable to safely store or prepare food, being subjected to constant unsanitary conditions, and suffering anxiety and lost property—constitutes a substantial interference with her tenancy.  

27. As a proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses estimated at $280, as well as emotional distress and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Maria Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on Count I for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff compensation for her direct monetary losses of approximately $280;  
D. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
