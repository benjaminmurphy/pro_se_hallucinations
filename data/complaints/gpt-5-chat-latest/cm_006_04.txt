### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

**Filed:** December 1, 2025

### INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), appearing **pro se**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting order entered on June 15, 2021, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, concerning the minor children, **Liam Sanders (age 8)** and **Ava Sanders (age 6)**. A substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the current judgment, warranting modification in the best interests of the children.

### PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson

2. **Defendant:** Michael Sanders  
   (Address unknown to Plaintiff; last known address: 45 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02145.)

---

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify judgments relating to custody and visitation when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred.  
4. Venue is proper in Middlesex County, where the original judgment was entered and where the children reside.

---

### PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5. On **June 15, 2021**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody and Visitation (“the Judgment”) granting Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children, with Defendant exercising parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek evening visit.  
6. Neither party was at that time in a live-in relationship, and therefore the Judgment made no provision concerning the children’s exposure to new partners or third parties during parenting time.

---

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the Judgment, the Defendant has begun cohabitating with an individual who has a criminal record including **assault and battery**, and who has previously been the subject of a **restraining order** obtained by a former partner.  
8. The minor children have reported to Plaintiff that this individual **frequently yells, slams doors**, and on at least one occasion **grabbed Liam’s arm hard enough to leave visible marks**.  
9. The children expressed fear and discomfort about returning to Defendant’s home when this person is present.  
10. On or about November 10, 2025, a **neighbor called the police** to Defendant’s residence during a loud argument while the children were there.  
11. These new and unanticipated conditions create a substantial risk to the children’s **emotional and physical well-being** and constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the 2021 Judgment.  
12. Continuation of the current unsupervised visitation arrangement would not be in the children’s best interests and would contravene the protective purposes of Massachusetts custody law.  
13. The Plaintiff does not seek to curtail Defendant’s relationship with the children but to ensure that visitation occurs in a safe and stable environment and that appropriate safeguards are imposed.

### ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES

14. The governing standard for custody modification in Massachusetts requires a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances, and (2) that modification will serve the **best interests of the child**.  *See* **G.L. c. 208, § 28**; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–86 (2006).  
15. Courts have held that exposure to domestic violence or unstable living conditions constitutes a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant modification.  *See* *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Care and Protection of Lillith*, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 132 (2004).  
16. The Court’s paramount consideration is the **safety, stability, and welfare of the children**.  *See* *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 401–02 (1981); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
17. The presence of a cohabitant with a violent criminal background may justify restrictions on visitation or requirements for supervision.  *See* *Ardizoni v. Raymond*, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  
18. Under **G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a)**, and **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, the Court may impose conditions necessary to safeguard the children’s best interests, including limitations on third-party contact during parenting time.  
19. The mandate of **G.L. c. 208, § 31A** (regarding abuse prevention) reinforces that custody and parenting determinations must protect children from exposure to domestic violence or abusive situations.  
20. As explained in *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) and *Smith v. Jones*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 129 (2006), the Court has broad equitable authority to modify parenting time when required by new circumstances affecting the welfare of the children.  
21. *See also* *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Care and Protection of Benjamin*, 403 Mass. 24 (1988); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (all affirming the court’s continuing jurisdiction to alter custody orders when new conditions materially affect the child).

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the June 15, 2021 Judgment;

   1. That the Defendant’s current live-in partner **shall not be present** during any parenting time unless expressly approved by the Court; or  
   2. In the alternative, that the Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised** by an appropriate professional supervisor or family service agency until further order of the Court;
