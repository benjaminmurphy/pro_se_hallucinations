---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **February 10, 2023**, Plaintiff lawfully entered upon the premises at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, for the purpose of delivering groceries to one of the tenants residing therein.  
7. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of the premises, owed a duty to maintain in a reasonably safe condition the sidewalk and common areas under her control, including areas reasonably expected to be used by tenants, guests, and lawful visitors.  
8. Following a snowstorm in early February 2023, Defendant partially shoveled the sidewalk, creating a narrow path down the center but failed to apply ice melt, sand, or salt.  
9. Over the ensuing days, melting and refreezing caused the shoveled section of the sidewalk to turn into a sheet of ice, rendering it dangerously slippery.  
10. Tenants of the building texted Defendant, informing her of the hazardous icy condition and even sending photographs of the ice accumulation.  
11. Upon information and belief, Defendant responded by saying “the sun will take care of it,” and took no further steps to mitigate the hazard.  
12. On February 10, 2023, while walking on the sidewalk to deliver groceries, Plaintiff slipped on the ice and fell forcefully onto her back.  
13. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a **lower back injury**, incurred approximately **$2,500 in medical expenses**, and lost approximately **$800 in wages** during her recovery.  
14. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and discomfort resulting from the occurrence and has sustained emotional distress and inconvenience as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully restated herein.  
16. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk and premises under her control in a condition reasonably safe for lawful visitors, pursuant to **Massachusetts common law** and **G.L. c. 231, § 85**.  
17. Defendant breached that duty by failing to properly remove ice and snow, failing to apply salt, sand, or similar de-icing materials, and by ignoring warnings from tenants concerning the hazardous condition.  
18. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under the standards set forth in **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**, which abolished the distinction between natural and unnatural accumulations of snow and ice and imposes a duty of reasonable care on property owners regarding snow and ice removal.  
19. Defendant’s failures were also unreasonable under the circumstances and contrary to the duty recognized in **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**, which imposes upon landowners a general duty of reasonable care to all lawful entrants.  
20. Defendant’s neglect was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.  
21. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s lack of reasonable care, consistent with **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)** (foreseeability of harm is a key component of negligence).  
22. The standards of reasonable maintenance of premises have been well established by **Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013)** and **Adams v. Dunton, 284 Mass. 63 (1933)**, which require landowners to inspect and remedy dangerous conditions they know or should know about.  
23. Defendant’s lack of action also violated her duty as described in **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165 (1973)**, which recognizes liability where a landowner’s inaction creates or compounds a hazardous condition.  
24. Under **Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244 (1982)** and **Banaghan v. Dewey, 340 Mass. 73 (1959)**, landowners remain liable for failure to eliminate reasonably foreseeable hazards within areas used by lawful visitors.  
25. By failing to act after knowledge of the dangerous icy condition, Defendant’s conduct was grossly negligent and displayed a reckless disregard for the safety of others, including Plaintiff.

### IV. DAMAGES

26. As a direct result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained painful personal injuries to her lower back, incurred **medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500**, and suffered **lost wages of approximately $800**.  
27. Plaintiff has endured pain, suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life.  
28. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all compensatory damages available under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other consequential damages.  
29. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on any judgment awarded.

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Emily Rodriguez, and grant the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably expected to exceed **$3,300**;  
B. Prejudgment interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. Costs of this action pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**;  
D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
