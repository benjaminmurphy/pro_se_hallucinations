While the full Mounsey decision does reform premises liability duties broadly, this particular cited text does not clearly establish the specific sidewalk/approach duty stated in the proposition.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential. This tends to perpetuate, although on a smaller scale, the kind of tradition-bound and mistaken analysis that I had supposed the court was aiming to correct.\""

The court expressly treats whether a danger is open and obvious as a legal duty question that can be resolved by the judge when only one conclusion can be drawn from the facts, rather than as a generally fact-dependent, jury issue.

While framed in terms of negligent failure to secure an instrumentality rather than an explicit \u2018duty to warn,\u2019 it squarely addresses landowner liability for hazardous conditions on the property and the failure to remedy or control those hazards.
