### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

#### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Rebecca Collins, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Tom Collins, also residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, **Max Collins**, age 8.

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28** and **c. 209C, § 20**, which authorize modification of a custody or parenting plan upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child.

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the minor child resides within this county and the prior custody order was entered by this Court.

---

#### III. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On **November 15, 2019**, this Court issued a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time awarding the Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, **primary physical custody** of the minor child, Max Collins, with the Defendant, Tom Collins, having three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon, **without overnights**.

7. At the time of the original order, the Defendant’s living situation consisted of renting a single room in a shared apartment with several roommates, and he did not have adequate space or accommodations for overnight parenting time.

---

#### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the November 15, 2019 order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** within the meaning of **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, justifying modification of the existing parenting plan.

9. Specifically:  
   a. The child, Max Collins, is now **eight years old** and enrolled in full‑time school, with greater developmental capacity for extended and overnight time with each parent.  
   b. The Defendant has secured a **stable, independent apartment** where the child has his **own bedroom and appropriate living accommodations**.  
   c. The current schedule, consisting of **three short weekday visits and a Sunday afternoon**, requires frequent transitions during school nights, disrupting the child’s homework, rest, and consistency.  
   d. The existing structure is **no longer consistent with Max’s best interests**, given his age, schooling, and the parents’ ability to cooperate.  
   e. Both parents now agree that the parenting plan should better reflect the child’s needs and reduce unnecessary transitions.  

10. These facts constitute a substantial and material change supporting modification under the standards elaborated in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**; and **Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981)**.

---

#### V. LEGAL STANDARD

11. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting time order when “a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”

12. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that modification requires both (1) a material change in circumstances, and (2) that the modification serve the child’s best interests. See  
   - **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)**;  
   - **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**;  
   - **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**;  
   - **Hunter v. Mason, 486 Mass. 607 (2021)**;  
   - **Hale v. Hale, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981)**.

13. The “best interests of the child” standard, as reaffirmed in **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)** and **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)**, requires consideration of the child’s age, needs, emotional ties, living arrangements, and stability.

---

#### VI. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

14. The Defendant’s improved housing and the child’s developmental changes satisfy the “material change in circumstances” requirement recognized in **Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016)**.

15. The current parenting plan, which fragments the child’s school nights and imposes unnecessary transitions, no longer supports the child’s educational and emotional well‑being, contrary to the principles stated in **Custody of Kali**, supra, and **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.

16. As both parents acknowledge the child’s desire and readiness for overnight contact with his father, the modification sought promotes the child’s stability and best interests, consistent with **Hunter v. Mason**, supra.

---

#### VII. REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Rebecca Collins**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior custody order dated November 15, 2019;

B. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting plan to provide for a schedule consistent with Max Collins’s developmental, educational, and emotional needs, including regular **overnight parenting time** with the Defendant, Tom Collins, such as one or two school‑night overnights and alternate weekends, or as otherwise deemed appropriate by the Court;

C. **Affirm** joint legal custody and maintain the parties’ cooperative decision‑making regarding the child’s welfare;

D. **Adjust** holiday, vacation, and transportation provisions as necessary to minimize disruption and enhance stability; and

E. **Grant such other and further relief** as this Court deems just and proper.

---

#### VIII. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE

I, Rebecca Collins, being duly sworn, depose and say that the facts stated above are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
