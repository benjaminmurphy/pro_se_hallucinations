      "support_reasoning": "Berman concerns breach of the implied warranty of habitability and the timing of rent abatement when there are losses of heat and hot water. It does not interpret or even cite M.G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, nor does it characterize the absence of hot water as a statutory \u2018interference\u2019 under that provision. The case therefore supports the broader notion that lack of heat/hot water is a material breach of the warranty of habitability, but not the specific statutory proposition about \u00a7 14 interference.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"He found and ruled that the losses of heat and hot water were material breaches of the warranty of habitability. The judge ruled further that the tenant is allowed to abate the rent from the date the landlord had notice of the breach of the warranty of habitability.\""
