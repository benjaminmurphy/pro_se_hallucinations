Dorfman holds that G.L. c. 143, \u00a7 51 does not apply to an owner-occupied two-family home with one rented unit and therefore does not impose strict liability on such a homeowner. The court explicitly declines to find statutory duty or liability under \u00a7 51 for this type of property and affirms summary judgment for the defendants. Thus, the opinion undermines, rather than supports, a claimed duty and breach by the defendant under that statute.",
