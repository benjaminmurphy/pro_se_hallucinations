### COMPLAINT

**Plaintiff, Jessica Langford (“Plaintiff”),** for her complaint against **Defendant, Mark Silverman (“Defendant”)**, alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Langford** resides at 55 E. Wareham Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  
2. Defendant **Mark Silverman** is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 55 E. Wareham Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (“the Premises”).  

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under **Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186 §14**, governing a landlord’s duty not to interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Boston Housing Court** pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C §3**, as the subject property is located within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **July 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises described above.  
6. Plaintiff has continuously paid rent of **$2,200.00 per month**.  
7. Beginning in or about **December 2024** and continuing through the **winter of 2025**, the heating system at the Premises repeatedly malfunctioned.  
8. The heat would drop to approximately **60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours**, often in the evenings, leaving the apartment uncomfortably and unsafely cold.  
9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating issues multiple times.  
10. Defendant arranged for repairs twice: the first service call temporarily improved performance; following the second, the service technician described the boiler as “old but functional” but provided no further remedy.  
11. The heat continued to fluctuate and fall below required levels, in violation of **105 C.M.R. §410.201**, requiring a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 A.M. and 11:00 P.M. and 64°F at night from September 15 through June 15.  
12. As a result of Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and operate two electric space heaters, causing **approximately $150.00 per month** in additional electricity costs.  
13. Plaintiff also developed **bronchitis in January 2025**, which her physician indicated was likely aggravated by exposure to cold interior temperatures.  
14. Plaintiff missed **three days of work** and incurred costs for medical treatment and medication.  
15. Plaintiff has informed Defendant of these continuing issues and requested proper repair and adjustment of rent; Defendant has refused, asserting the heat “is working.”  
16. Defendant’s actions and omissions have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to enjoy her home in peace, comfort, and safety.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186 §14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 186 §14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises is liable for damages.  
19. Defendant’s failure to provide reasonably adequate and consistent heat constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of the statute.  
20. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have held landlords liable for such interference, including failure to maintain essential services. See, e.g.:  
   - **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for tenant’s loss of quiet enjoyment caused by conditions under landlord’s control).  
   - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s inaction regarding habitability defects constitutes interference with quiet enjoyment).  
   - **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (landlord’s duty extends to providing safe and habitable premises).  
   - **Ahearn v. Stacey**, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 678 (1991) (interference includes failure to maintain essential services).  
   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (quiet enjoyment breach does not require malicious intent).  
   - **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (heat failures support claim under §14).  
   - **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman**, 417 Mass. 771 (1994) (tenant may recover for interference with use and enjoyment of dwelling).  
   - **Meadow Hill Estates, Inc. v. Branscombe**, 593 N.E.2d 1379 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992) (landlord’s inadequate heat supports damages).  
   - **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing duty to maintain habitability included in tenancy).  
   - **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (persistent defects causing discomfort establish breach).  
21. Defendant’s actions and failures constitute both a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and a violation of **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. §410.000 et seq.**  
22. Plaintiff has suffered damages including but not limited to discomfort, health effects, out-of-pocket expenses for electricity and medical costs, and diminution in rental value.  
23. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186 §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and consequential damages**, or at minimum **three months’ rent**, whichever is greater, along with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (though Plaintiff is self-represented).

## V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186 §14;  
B. Award Plaintiff **damages of not less than $1,200.00** or such greater amount as determined by the Court, including enhanced statutory damages of three months’ rent ($6,600.00) as permitted under law;
