### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease with Defendant to rent the second‑floor apartment at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA, for a monthly rent of **$1,500**.  

6. The lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to the **“quiet enjoyment”** of her apartment.  

7. In or about **June 2025**, tenants moved into the third‑floor apartment above Plaintiff. Since that time, there has been **persistent, excessive noise**, including loud footsteps, furniture being dragged across the floor late at night, and music played during late and early morning hours.  

8. Plaintiff repeatedly contacted Defendant—approximately **five or six times**—complaining about the severe and continuing noise disturbances and requesting remedial action.  

9. Defendant responded **only once**, stating that he “can’t control how people live,” and took no meaningful steps to correct or abate the situation.  

10. As a result of the ongoing disturbances, Plaintiff has been deprived of her reasonable use and enjoyment of her apartment; she suffers from chronic sleep deprivation, has received a **written warning at work** for falling asleep at her desk, and has incurred **medical expenses**—including sleep medication costing approximately **$40 per month**—to mitigate her symptoms.  

11. Plaintiff has also expended money on **earplugs**, a **white‑noise machine**, and other efforts to reduce the disturbances, without success.  

12. Plaintiff continues to pay full rent but has been denied the benefit of quiet enjoyment as guaranteed under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.” The statute provides that any landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages, or **three months’ rent**, whichever is greater.  

15. A landlord’s **failure to take reasonable steps** to prevent or abate disturbances substantially interfering with a tenant’s use of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714 (1977)** (landlord liable for noise disturbances emanating from another tenant’s premises where landlord had control to prevent them).  

16. Defendant had **notice** of the ongoing disturbances and the ability to take corrective action—such as warning or evicting the tenants responsible, repairing soundproofing, or otherwise securing quiet enjoyment—but failed to act.  

17. Defendant’s inaction constitutes an **“indirect interference”** under *Blackett* and its progeny, rendering him liable under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

18. Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease and is **non‑waivable** by the tenant. See *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91 (1982)**; *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847 (1997)**.  

19. The interference at issue was substantial, continuing, and foreseeable. The Defendant’s failure to remedy these disturbances amounts to **constructive interference** with Plaintiff’s tenancy.  

20. Defendant’s conduct and omissions are further contrary to Massachusetts precedent, including:  
   - *Lowery v. Robinson*, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)** (failure to address persistent conditions causing loss of enjoyment constitutes breach);  
   - *Brown v. LeClair*, **20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985)** (landlord responsible for failure to control other tenants creating disturbances);  
   - *Keegan v. MacDonald*, **27 Mass. App. Ct. 45 (1989)** (interference need not be direct to constitute breach);  
   - *Jablonski v. Casey*, **64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005)** (covenant breached when landlord fails to maintain peaceable conditions);  
   - *Damiano v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co.*, **316 Mass. 626 (1944)** (quiet enjoyment guarantees lawful possession free from interference);  
   - *Reis v. Miller*, **19 Mass. L. Rptr. 233 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2005)** (noise complaints ignored by landlord establish violation);  
   - *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, **379 Mass. 196 (1979)** (damages may include emotional distress and inconvenience caused by interference).  

21. Due to Defendant’s violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff has suffered **loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, lost wages, and out‑of‑pocket medical expenses**.  

22. Plaintiff is entitled to **statutory damages** equal to **three months’ rent ($4,500)** or her actual damages—estimated at **$2,000 plus ongoing losses**—whichever is greater, as well as costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (even if self‑represented, courts may award reasonable fees under *Meikle v. Nurse*, **474 Mass. 207 (2016)**).

### V. DAMAGES

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:  
   a. Loss of sleep and emotional distress;  
   b. Medical expenses and medication costs (~$40 per month);  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenditures for noise mitigation;  
   d. Diminished work performance and employment discipline; and  
   e. Statutory and consequential damages under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment**;  
B. Award damages in an amount not less than **three months’ rent ($4,500)** or actual damages proven at trial, whichever is greater;  
C. Award reimbursement for out‑of‑pocket expenses and consequential losses;  
D. Award costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
