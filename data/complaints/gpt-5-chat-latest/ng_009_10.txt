### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
*(Negligence – Personal Injury)*  

---

#### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 3B, Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts 01905.  
2. Defendant **Lynn Apartments LLC** (“Defendant”) is a Massachusetts limited liability company with a principal place of business in Lynn, Massachusetts. Defendant owns, manages, and controls the residential apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, MA 01905 (“the Premises”).

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, because the acts and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred within Essex County, and Defendant conducts business in this jurisdiction.  
4. The amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court Department of the Trial Court.

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all relevant times, Defendant, as owner and landlord, had a legal duty to maintain the common areas of the Premises, including smoke detection systems, in a reasonably safe condition for tenants and lawful occupants.  
6. Massachusetts law requires landlords to install, inspect, and maintain operable smoke detectors in common hallways of multi-unit residential buildings. **See G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E, 26F; 527 CMR 1.00 § 13.7.1.10.7.2**.  
7. For several months prior to August 15, 2023, the smoke detector located in the third-floor hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment chirped continuously, indicating a low battery.  
8. Sometime thereafter, an unknown person removed the battery from the detector, which was then left sitting on a nearby windowsill.  
9. Plaintiff personally notified Defendant or its property management representatives on at least three separate occasions that the detector had no functioning battery and required maintenance.  
10. Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff that it would “take care of it” but failed to repair or replace the battery or detector.  
11. On or about **August 15, 2023**, a fire began in a first-floor apartment’s kitchen area.  
12. Because the hallway smoke detector on the third floor was inoperative, Plaintiff and other tenants received no early warning of the fire.  
13. Plaintiff only became aware of the blaze when she smelled smoke. By then, the third-floor hallway was already filled with heavy smoke.  
14. Plaintiff attempted to evacuate and suffered acute **smoke inhalation**, requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization overnight.  
15. Plaintiff incurred **medical expenses of approximately $5,800** and **lost wages of approximately $1,200** due to her injury.  
16. Plaintiff’s personal property sustained further damage from smoke and water during fire suppression efforts.  
17. Defendant’s failure to maintain an operable smoke detector was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–17 above.  
19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a **duty of reasonable care** to maintain the Premises, including common area smoke detection systems, in a safe and compliant condition. **See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)** (landlords owe lawful occupants a duty of reasonable care).  
20. Defendant breached this duty by:  
   a. Failing to maintain a functional smoke detector;  
   b. Ignoring Plaintiff’s repeated notice of the defect; and  
   c. Violating statutory safety requirements under **G.L. c. 148** and applicable fire codes.  
21. Defendant’s negligence directly and foreseeably caused Plaintiff to suffer injury when she was deprived of early warning of the fire and inhaled smoke.  
22. Plaintiff’s harm was the natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s omissions. **See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47 (1983)** (foreseeability governs duty to prevent harm); **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)** (duty arises where harm is foreseeable); **Toubiana v. Priestly, 402 Mass. 84 (1988)** (landlord liable for failure to maintain safe premises).  
23. Defendant’s negligence further violated **G.L. c. 186, § 14** (requiring landlords to maintain premises in compliance with health and safety regulations) and **G.L. c. 111, § 127A** (mandating compliance with sanitary and safety codes).  
24. Under **Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980)**, landlords must maintain common areas in reasonable repair. Defendant’s failure to do so constitutes actionable negligence.  
25. Defendant’s breach also contravened **G.L. c. 148, § 34B**, which imposes duties regarding fire safety equipment maintenance.  
26. Plaintiff relied upon Defendant’s continuing assurances that the smoke detector would be repaired and had no practicable means of self-maintenance.  
27. As a result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, and property damage compensable under **Mass. tort law**.  
28. Under **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc., 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002)**, a plaintiff may recover all reasonably foreseeable damages from breach of duty.  
29. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of its nondelegable duty to maintain fire safety systems in habitable premises, as recognized in **Lafond v. Frame, 327 Mass. 364 (1951)** and **Lombardi v. Quality Fin. Servs., Inc., 915 F. Supp. 155 (D. Mass. 1996)**.  
30. Plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages for all medical expenses, lost wages, and damage to personal property, as well as any other relief deemed just.

#### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant **Lynn Apartments LLC** as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably expected to exceed **$7,000**, representing the total of medical expenses, lost wages, property loss, and pain and suffering;  
B. For costs and reasonable interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. For all other relief that this Court deems just and proper.
