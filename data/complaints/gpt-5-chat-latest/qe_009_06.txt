**JASMINE REED,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**THOMAS BLACKWOOD,**  
Defendant.  

Docket No. _________  

---

### COMPLAINT

**Plaintiff, Jasmine Reed (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant, Thomas Blackwood (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:**

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jasmine Reed, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.

2. Defendant, Thomas Blackwood, is an individual and the landlord and owner of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (“the Premises”), which he rents to Plaintiff.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing residential tenancies.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Springfield District Court under G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 239, § 1A because the Premises are located in Springfield, and the acts complained of occurred within this judicial district.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written lease agreement beginning on or about June 1, 2022, for a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

6. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.

7. Beginning approximately six weeks prior to December 1, 2025, one bedroom in the apartment lost electrical power entirely. Neither the outlets nor the overhead light functioned.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant sent an electrician, who confirmed that the problem required substantial wiring repairs.

9. Defendant has failed to make the necessary repairs for a period exceeding six weeks, advising Plaintiff only that he was “getting quotes” and that the work was “complicated” due to the building’s old wiring.

10. As a result of Defendant’s failure to repair, one of the two bedrooms in the apartment has remained unusable, depriving Plaintiff of full use and enjoyment of her rented home.

11. Plaintiff had been using the affected bedroom as her home office for remote work and was forced to relocate her work setup to coffee shops and a coworking space.

12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $15 per day in expenses for food and coffee to work outside her home and $150 per month for coworking space membership.

13. Plaintiff’s living conditions have been materially impaired, and she has been deprived of the quiet enjoyment of her tenancy as guaranteed by Massachusetts law.

14. Plaintiff continues to pay full rent despite being unable to use one of two bedrooms due to the electrical defect.

15. The unremedied lack of electricity in part of the apartment constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises,” and a substantial interference constitutes a breach.

18. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the apartment’s electrical system has substantially deprived Plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of her leased Premises, constituting a constructive interference by omission.

19. Massachusetts courts recognize that “serious defects in essential services such as heat, electricity, or hot water” can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982).

20. A landlord’s inaction may amount to interference when the defect substantially impairs the character of the tenancy. *See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994); *Cohen v. Werner*, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 287 (2012).

21. Electrical service is an essential condition of human habitation under Massachusetts law. *See Hemingway v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 201 (1979).

22. Defendant’s prolonged failure to restore electricity to a significant portion of the dwelling constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy, violating G.L. c. 186, § 14.

23. Plaintiff is entitled to damages including rent abatement, reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs, and statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, pursuant to *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) and *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).

24. Defendant acted with knowledge of the defect and failed to act within a reasonable time following notice, which constitutes willful neglect under *Dorgan v. Loukas*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1985).

25. Defendant’s acts and omissions also violate the standards expressed in G.L. c. 239, § 8A; G.L. c. 111, § 127L; and 105 C.M.R. 410.351, which require landlords to maintain electrical facilities in safe and operable condition. See *Balsavich v. Local 170 Teamsters Welfare Fund*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 728 (2016) (recognizing statutory interrelation of housing and tenancy maintenance obligations).

26. Defendant’s conduct therefore constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as recognized in *Leardi v. Brown*, 394 Mass. 151, 157 (1985) and *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 867 (1991).

---

### V. DAMAGES

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:

   a. Loss of use of the second bedroom/home office for approximately six weeks;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses for coffee shop patronage and coworking space access, estimated at $15 per day and $150 per month;  
   c. Diminution in rental value of the apartment; and  
   d. Emotional distress and disruption to Plaintiff’s living and working environment.

28. Plaintiff estimates these damages at least $900 in out-of-pocket costs and asserts entitlement to statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual damages, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs;  
B. For reimbursement of out-of-pocket consequential losses in the approximate amount of $900;  
C. For rent abatement corresponding to the diminution in value of the Premises during the period of deprivation;  
D. For interest and court costs as provided by law; and  
E. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VIII. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE

I, Jasmine Reed, verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing factual allegations are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Date: **December 1, 2025**  
Respectfully submitted,
