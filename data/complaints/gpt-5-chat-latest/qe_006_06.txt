### COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Jessica Martin (“Plaintiff”) brings this complaint against Defendant Thomas Reynolds (“Defendant”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martin is an individual residing at 250 Main Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  
2. Defendant Thomas Reynolds is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and the owner and landlord of the premises located at 250 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** (district court civil jurisdiction).  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 2** because the property that is the subject of this action is located in Brockton, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written residential tenancy with Defendant for the apartment located at 250 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the apartment since that date, paying monthly rent of $1,200.  
7. Approximately three weeks prior to the filing of this complaint—on or about November 10, 2025—the apartment’s hot water ceased functioning.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue the same day.  
9. Defendant acknowledged the loss of hot water and indicated that a replacement part had been ordered.  
10. Over the ensuing weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly communicated with Defendant, who stated that the part was backordered and repairs would take additional time.  
11. As of the date of filing, Plaintiff has been without hot water for approximately three weeks.  
12. The lack of hot water has interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to shower, wash dishes, and bathe her infant child.  
13. Plaintiff has incurred additional expenses, including approximately $30 per month in gym membership fees and added gasoline costs for travel to bathe and shower elsewhere.  
14. Despite notice of the problem and a reasonable opportunity to remedy it, Defendant has failed to restore hot water service in violation of his statutory and common-law obligations.  
15. Plaintiff has suffered a substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the premises as a direct result of Defendant’s actions and omissions.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(**G.L. c. 186, § 14**)

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 15.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of a tenant’s leased premises.  
18. A substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment, such as the failure to maintain essential services like hot water, constitutes a breach of this covenant even absent malice or intent.  
19. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized the deprivation of essential utilities as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 717–18 (1977) (substantial interference constitutes breach); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982) (landlord’s failure to maintain property leading to loss of essential services supports liability); **Winchester v. O'Brien**, 266 Mass. 33 (1929) (landlord liable for consequences of failure to provide heat); **Hemingway v. O’Hara**, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2005) (persistent maintenance failures breach covenant).  
20. Defendant’s failure to ensure continuous hot water service constitutes a material and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**.  
21. Defendant’s conduct also constitutes a violation of the implied warranty of habitability under **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973),** as the absence of hot water renders the premises unfit for human habitation**.  
22. A landlord’s “good faith” or “effort” to obtain a repair part does not excuse delay that results in ongoing deprivation of an essential service. See **Cunningham v. Davis**, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 12 (2018).  
23. The continuing lack of hot water amounts to a “continuing violation” under **Spence v. O'Brien**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983),** resulting in ongoing injury to Plaintiff’s tenancy rights**.  
24. Defendant’s failure to act within a reasonable time after notice constitutes a constructive eviction as well as a breach of the covenant, see **Westland Hous. Corp. v. Scott**, 312 Mass. 375 (1942); **Dwelley v. Chesterfield**, 386 Mass. 228, 236 (1982).  
25. Plaintiff has been deprived of the use and comfort of her home and forced to expend money and effort to obtain basic necessities.  
26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

---

### V. DAMAGES

27. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages of approximately $600 due to loss of use, inconvenience, and additional expenses.  
28. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to treble damages, amounting to three months’ rent ($3,600), or actual damages, whichever is greater.  
29. Plaintiff also seeks reimbursement for costs of this action and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Martin respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on the claim of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages equal to three times her monthly rent, or in the alternative, her actual damages of $600, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and any other relief to which she may be entitled at law or in equity; and  
D. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
