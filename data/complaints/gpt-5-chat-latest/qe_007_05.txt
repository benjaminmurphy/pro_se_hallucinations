2. Defendant, **Michael Thompson**, upon information and belief, is the owner and landlord of the Premises, conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19**, as this is a civil matter where the amount in controversy is under $25,000.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff has rented the Premises from Defendant since **June 1, 2021**, under a written lease agreement, paying monthly rent of **$2,400**.  
6. Defendant is presently undertaking substantial renovation work on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment at 45 Harvard Street.  
7. The construction began approximately two months ago, around **October 1, 2025**, and occurs daily from approximately **8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.**, Monday through Friday.  
8. Said renovation activities have involved **drilling, hammering, and other construction noises** that are continuous and severe enough to disrupt Plaintiff’s daily life.  
9. Plaintiff works from home and frequently must conduct phone and video conferences as part of her employment, but the pervasive construction noise has made this extremely difficult.  
10. Dust, debris, and construction particulates regularly enter Plaintiff’s apartment through the air vents, affecting air quality and cleanliness.  
11. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of these issues.  
12. Defendant acknowledged the inconvenience and offered Plaintiff a **$100 rent reduction for one month**, which did not reasonably compensate for the disruption.  
13. Defendant has stated that the construction will continue for **an additional one to two months**, prolonging the deprivation of Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of her home.  
14. Plaintiff has continued to pay full rent, with only the minor concession noted above, but has been **unreasonably disturbed** by ongoing noise, dust, and loss of peaceful residence.  
15. As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered **loss of use and enjoyment**, **disruption to her work**, and **emotional distress**, and seeks **$2,000 in damages.**

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not, directly or indirectly, interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of their rented premises.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from acts or omissions of a landlord that **“materially interfer[e] with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment of the premises.”** *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
19. The covenant may be breached even when a landlord does not intend the interference, if the landlord’s actions or those under his control cause a substantial disturbance. *Id.*  
20. Defendant’s renovation activities, including construction noise and dust infiltration, constitute a material interference with the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  
21. The Defendant, as landlord, had **control over the renovation schedule, the contractors’ behavior, and the methods used**, and therefore bears legal responsibility for the interference.  
22. The ongoing and excessive noise and dust have substantially deprived Plaintiff of the peaceful possession of her home in violation of her rights under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
23. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord’s conduct “disturbs, interferes with, or deprives the tenant of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises.” *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  
24. Defendant’s conduct has resulted in continuous substantial interference akin to that found actionable in *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); and *Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC*, 478 Mass. 697 (2018).  
25. The duty of quiet enjoyment extends to protection from noise and environmental disruption caused by the landlord or those acting under his direction. *See* *Winchester v. McCue*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 1106 (2001).  
26. Defendant’s minimal monetary concession fails to cure or mitigate the continuing breach and does not satisfy the statutory protection under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
27. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including **loss of enjoyment, inconvenience, stress, and diminished habitability**, recognized as compensable in *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); *Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc.*, 437 Mass. 708 (2002); and *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, supra.  
28. Defendant’s actions and omissions have thus breached Plaintiff’s statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment.

### V. DAMAGES

29. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has sustained actual damages estimated at **$2,000**, reflecting loss of use and enjoyment, annoyance, discomfort, and disruption of Plaintiff’s home environment.  
30. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and consequential damages, or not less than three months’ rent** if greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (even if pro se).

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Lin** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Michael Thompson** for **$2,000** in compensatory damages, or treble damages as permitted under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and any statutory attorney’s fees;  
C. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
