However, the interference here stems from failure to maintain sanitary, watertight conditions inside the premises, not from failure to maintain building entrance security.

Therefore, Gem is liable under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14."

Doe squarely holds that a landlord\u2019s failure to take available measures to remove unwelcome persons engaged in unlawful activity, where their presence seriously interferes with tenants\u2019 use of the property, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. That directly supports using landlord inaction in the face of such disturbances as a basis for liability for loss of peace, comfort, and security in the tenancy.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe do believe, however, that if the defendant has failed to take any measures, especially those measures which can be undertaken relatively easily, to remove unwelcome persons from the property that it owns and controls, and the presence of those persons seriously interferes with the tenancy, then the defendant may be liable for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment\u2026. If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

It cites prior cases and states that a landlord\u2019s omission to repair defects of which he has notice, where the natural and probable consequence is interference with the tenant\u2019s rights, violates \u00a7 14. That aligns with the proposition that not repairing known safety or security risks can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We noted that a landlord\u2019s failure \u201cto repair defects of which he has notice in leased premises is an omission which frequently has been deemed to violate \u00a7 14.\u201d See Cruz, supra at 789, citing Simon v. Solomon, supra at 103 (failure to control floods in tenant\u2019s apartment); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (failure to repair leaky roof); Dorgan v. Loukas, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985) (failure to bring apartment into habitable condition and keep it so). Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord\u2026"

Instead, it reiterates the general standard that quiet enjoyment protects against serious interference and usually requires landlord notice and at least negligence, then holds there was no breach because the landlord acted promptly and the conditions were remedied. The case therefore does not establish the specific rule that failure to repair known safety or security defects is itself a breach; it actually finds no breach on the facts presented.",

New Bedford Hous. Authy., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994). Generally, the landlord must have had notice of the condition interfering with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises, and he must have at least acted negligently in not alleviating the condition. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850-851 (1997). Here, York acted immediately upon being notified by Casey of the defective conditions\u2026 The trial judge did not err in\u2026[finding no] breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"
