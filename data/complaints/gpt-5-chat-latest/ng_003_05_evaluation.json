Ellard abolished the strict common-law invitee/licensee distinction in Massachusetts and adopted a general duty of reasonable care owed by possessors of land to lawful visitors, which includes business customers of a store. While the provided excerpt is from a concurrence and focuses on trespassers, the main opinion at 363 Mass. 707\u201308 explains that occupiers must exercise reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe for lawful visitors, which covers business invitees such as store customers. Thus, the case supports the proposition, though it reframes it in broader terms.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We hold, therefore, that the common law distinctions between invitees and licensees should be abolished. The standard of care owed by an occupier of land should no longer depend on the status of the entrant but on whether the occupier has exercised reasonable care in the circumstances to maintain his property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk."
