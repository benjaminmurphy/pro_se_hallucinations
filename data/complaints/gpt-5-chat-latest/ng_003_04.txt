Plaintiff Michael Thompson (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Michael Thompson is an individual residing in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Upon information and belief, Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store is a business entity operating retail stores in Massachusetts, including a location at 123 Main Street, Lowell, MA 01851.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction lies in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and the incident occurred within Middlesex County.  
4. Venue is proper in the Superior Court sitting in Lowell because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully present at Defendant’s retail store located at 123 Main Street, Lowell, MA, as a business invitee.  
6. At that time, Defendant and its employees had stacked multiple heavy boxes of appliances, including toaster ovens, on shelving units approximately five to six boxes high.  
7. These boxes were unsecured—lacking straps, guards, or barriers—and were accessible to customers browsing in the aisle.  
8. Another customer, while pushing a standard shopping cart in a normal, foreseeable manner, bumped the lower shelf.  
9. A large toaster-oven box fell from an upper shelf, striking Plaintiff on the head and right shoulder.  
10. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness, confusion, and pain, and the store manager documented the incident in an incident report.  
11. Later that evening, Plaintiff sought emergency medical attention. Physicians diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a right shoulder strain.  
12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $800 in wages because he was unable to return to work as a delivery driver for several days.  
13. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to participate in his regular recreational soccer activities for approximately one month.  
14. Defendant, through its agents, employees, and managers, created and/or allowed a dangerous condition to persist in the store by stacking heavy merchandise in an unstable and unsafe manner without proper restraints.  
15. Defendant knew or should have known that the method of stacking goods created a foreseeable risk of falling merchandise causing injury to customers.  
16. Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in inspecting, maintaining, and securing the merchandise display.  

---

### IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition and to protect against foreseeable risks of harm. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  
19. Defendant breached that duty by failing to safely stock and secure the merchandise on its shelves, by neglecting to use safety restraints or barriers, and by failing to warn customers of the danger of falling merchandise.  
20. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused the box to fall and strike Plaintiff, resulting in his injuries and damages.  

---

### V. LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES

21. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier is liable for injuries caused by its failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010).  
22. The standard of care owed to business invitees requires the possessor of land to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 152 (2013).  
23. A store is liable where its employees know or should know that merchandise is stacked dangerously high or unsecured. *Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  
24. A dangerous condition that exists for a sufficient period of time to be discovered and corrected constitutes notice. *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783 (2007).  
25. Negligence consists of “failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances.” *Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (1999).  
26. Causation exists where the negligent conduct was a substantial contributing factor in producing the harm. *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002).  
27. A business is responsible for the acts and omissions of its employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior. *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319 (2002); *Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.*, 389 Mass. 47, 62 (1983).  
28. Massachusetts General Laws c. 231, § 85 sets forth the applicable comparative negligence standard.  
29. Defendant’s failure to follow ordinary safety practices, including safe stacking procedures, constitutes breach of duty under *Kennedy v. Cummings*, 195 Mass. 121 (1907) (duty to prevent foreseeable harm).  
30. Plaintiff thereby suffered physical injury, lost wages, medical expenses, and pain and suffering within the meaning of recoverable tort damages. *Alecks v. Trustees of Boston Univ.*, 341 Mass. 731 (1961).

### VI. DAMAGES

31. As a direct result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200, lost wages of approximately $800, and experienced substantial pain and suffering.  
32. Plaintiff continues to experience occasional discomfort in his shoulder and headaches attributable to the incident.

A. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the jury, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;
