The opinion emphasizes that the landlords\u2019 failure to effectively correct the condition, despite notice and some efforts, resulted in a substantial interference with habitability and justified nonpayment of rent.

The court expressly rejects the landlord\u2019s attempt to blame third parties by emphasizing that the flooding was a preventable condition the landlord had a duty to correct, but it does not involve or discuss disturbances such as noise or misconduct by other tenants.

Thus, it does not support the proposition that defendant\u2019s inaction, by itself, automatically amounts to an \"indirect interference\" prohibited by statute.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence.
