Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(M.G.L. c. 208 § 28; M.G.L. c. 209 § 37; M.G.L. c. 209C § 20)

---

### **I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, brings this Complaint pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208 § 28**, which authorizes the Probate and Family Court to modify existing custody judgments upon a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the welfare of the minor children.

2. The Defendant, **Michael Thompson**, is likewise a resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court issued a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time on **May 10, 2022**, establishing **shared legal custody** of the minor children, **Emma Thompson (age 10)** and **Noah Thompson (age 8)**, with a parenting schedule providing that the children primarily reside with Jessica Thompson and visit with Michael Thompson on a regular schedule.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper under **M.G.L. c. 215 § 6** and **M.G.L. c. 208 § 28**, as both parents and the minor children reside within Bristol County.

### **II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS (MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES)**

5. Since entry of the Judgment on **May 10, 2022**, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the children.

6. The Defendant, Michael Thompson, has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities and events that occur during the Plaintiff’s custodial weekends without prior notice, consultation, or mutual agreement, in contravention of the shared legal custody arrangement and the spirit of co-parenting contemplated by the prior order.

7. Michael Thompson has informed the children that it is “their mother's fault” when they are unable to attend such activities while in her care, undermining the children’s trust and sense of security with the Plaintiff.

8. The children have reported to Jessica Thompson that Michael Thompson refers to her as “selfish” and says she “doesn’t really love them” when issues of scheduling arise.

9. As a result of these behaviors, the children—particularly Noah—have exhibited anxiety symptoms, such as stomach aches and reluctance during custody transitions, suggesting emotional distress linked to parental conflict.

10. The prior order directed both parents to refrain from disparaging the other and to encourage positive relationships between the children and both parents. The Defendant’s conduct has directly contravened these provisions.

11. Despite repeated good faith attempts by the Plaintiff to resolve these issues through communication and compromise, the Defendant has persisted in unilateral decision-making and disparaging remarks.

12. These changes have impacted the children’s emotional well‑being, the stability of the parenting schedule, and the parties’ ability to co‑parent effectively, all constituting a **material change in circumstances warranting modification** of custody and parenting time.

### **III. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF**

13. Under **M.G.L. c. 208 § 28**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances, and when the proposed modification serves the **“best interests of the child.”**

14. The controlling standard in Massachusetts for modification of custody orders is articulated in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985),** and **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**—the party seeking modification must demonstrate that circumstances have materially changed and that modification is in the best interests of the children.

15. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of fostering positive relationships between both parents and protecting children from parental disparagement:  
    - **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (best interests of the child govern all custody decisions).  
    - **Haas v. Puchalski**, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980) (where shared custody becomes inimical to child’s welfare, modification is justified).  
    - **White v. Laingor**, 434 Mass. 64 (2001) (court must approve modification promoting child’s psychological well-being).  
    - **Zullo v. Goguen**, 423 Mass. 679 (1996) (significant hostility and inability to communicate warrant modification of shared authority).  
    - **Felton v. Felton**, 383 Mass. 232 (1981) (children’s emotional health takes precedence over parental convenience).  
    - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (shared custody requires ability to cooperate and communicate).  
    - **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (material change shown when joint custody no longer serves children’s best interests).  
    - **M.G.L. c. 208 §§ 28, 31** (statutory authority for modification and determination of custody in the best interests of the child).  
    - **M.G.L. c. 209C § 20** (court may modify custody or support orders based on changes affecting child welfare).  
    - **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7** (Complaint for Modification is the proper procedural mechanism to request change).

16. In light of the ongoing parental conflict, unilateral decision‑making, and disparaging behavior, shared physical or legal custody is no longer beneficial to Emma and Noah’s best interests, as contemplated in **Custody of Kali, supra**, and **Zullo v. Goguen, supra**.

17. The statutory framework and supporting precedents demonstrate that the court has the authority and obligation to act when existing custodial arrangements no longer safeguard the children’s emotional and developmental welfare.

### **IV. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

A. **Modify the current custody order** dated **May 10, 2022**, to award **primary legal and physical custody** of the minor children, **Emma Thompson** and **Noah Thompson**, to **Jessica Thompson**, subject to appropriate parenting time for **Michael Thompson**;

B. **Clarify and redefine the decision‑making process** regarding extracurricular activities, medical care, and education, requiring mutual consultation and written agreement prior to scheduling activities that affect the other parent’s custodial time;

C. **Enjoin both parties** from making disparaging remarks about the other in the presence of the children and require each parent to foster and encourage a healthy relationship with the other parent;

D. **Order such counseling or co‑parenting education** as the Court may deem appropriate to minimize conflict and protect the children’s best interests;

E. **Grant such further relief as justice and equity require.**
