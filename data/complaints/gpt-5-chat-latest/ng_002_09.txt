---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. The acts and omissions complained of occurred entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On **July 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was jogging on a public path in **Oak Hill Park**, a public recreation area owned and maintained by the City of Newton.  
7. Prominent signage throughout Oak Hill Park states: *“Dogs must be kept on leash at all times.”*  
8. Defendant was present in the park with his large dog. Despite the posted requirement, Defendant customarily allowed his dog to run unleashed.  
9. On the date in question, Defendant held a leash over his shoulder while conversing with others approximately thirty (30) feet away from his dog.  
10. As Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on the path, Defendant’s unleashed dog suddenly ran toward her, barking aggressively.  
11. Fearing that the dog would bite or attack, Plaintiff swerved off the paved path to avoid contact.  
12. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped over a protruding tree root and fell down a small embankment, sustaining a **fracture of her wrist**.  
13. The dog stopped before reaching Plaintiff, after which Defendant called the dog back.  
14. Several other joggers witnessed the incident.  
15. Plaintiff was transported to the emergency department where she was diagnosed with a **fractured wrist**, required bracing, and underwent follow‑up medical treatment.  
16. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500.00 in medical expenses**.  
17. Plaintiff also lost approximately **$1,200.00 in wages** due to her inability to work.  
18. Plaintiff suffered physical pain, inconvenience, and emotional distress and was unable to participate in previously planned activities, including a piano recital.  
19. Defendant’s failure to leash his dog in an area requiring leashes created an unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury to park users such as Plaintiff.  
20. Defendant had a duty to comply with municipal and state laws requiring restraint of dogs and to exercise reasonable care in controlling his animal.  
21. Defendant breached this duty by intentionally or negligently allowing the dog to run loose.  
22. Defendant’s breach was the **proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence**

23. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1–22 as though fully stated herein.  
24. Under Massachusetts law, a person owes a duty of reasonable care to all foreseeable persons who may be injured by his acts or omissions. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); **Leavitt v. Brockton Hospital, Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37 (2009).  
25. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to act as a reasonably prudent dog owner would under similar circumstances by keeping his dog leashed in compliance with local law and by taking reasonable steps to prevent the dog from frightening or endangering persons lawfully using the park.  
26. The City of Newton’s leash requirement, authorized under **G.L. c. 140 § 173** and related municipal ordinances, imposes an affirmative duty on dog owners to restrain their animals in public spaces.  
27. Violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect persons from harm constitutes evidence of negligence. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355 (1990); **Lyon v. Moreno**, 332 Mass. 438 (1955).  
28. Defendant breached his duty of care by (a) permitting his dog to be off‑leash in violation of the posted ordinance; (b) failing to keep reasonable control of the dog; and (c) failing to warn others, including Plaintiff, that the dog was not restrained.  
29. Defendant knew or should have known that such conduct created a foreseeable risk that persons might be startled or injured while attempting to avoid the animal. *See* **Freyermuth v. L.L. Bean, Inc.**, 376 Mass. 457 (1978); **Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.**, 376 Mass. 101 (1978).  
30. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. *Cf.* **Abruzzo v. City of Concord**, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 179 (2010).  
31. Defendant’s argument that the dog made no physical contact is not a defense where Defendant’s negligent act foreseeably caused Plaintiff to take evasive action resulting in harm. *See* **Wallace v. Laufer**, 336 Mass. 303 (1957) (fear‑induced reaction caused by defendant’s negligence gives rise to liability); **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 296** (1965).  
32. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained damages, including physical injury, medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering, and emotional distress. *See* **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739 (1995); **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982).  
33. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all compensatory damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence under **G.L. c. 231 § 85** (comparative negligence).

### V. DAMAGES

34. Plaintiff has incurred special damages totaling approximately **$3,700**, consisting of:  
   a. Medical expenses – $2,500.00  
   b. Lost wages – $1,200.00  
35. Plaintiff also seeks general damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact.  
36. Plaintiff further seeks costs of suit, prejudgment interest under **G.L. c. 231 § 6B**, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Freeman** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Tom Holland** on the claim for negligence;  
2. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;
