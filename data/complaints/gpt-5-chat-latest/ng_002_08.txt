## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. On the afternoon of **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging along a designated path within the **Parks and Recreation Trails, 45 Park Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts**.  
8. Prominent signage in the park clearly stated that all dogs must be kept on leashes while in the park, in accordance with **Newton Revised Ordinances §§ 12-31 and 12-35**, and consistent with **G.L. c. 140, § 173**, which authorizes municipal leash control.  
9. At the same time and place, Defendant was present with a large dog under his control.  
10. Despite carrying a leash, Defendant knowingly permitted his dog to run loose, off-leash, and away from his immediate control.  
11. While Plaintiff was jogging past, Defendant’s dog abruptly charged toward her, barking aggressively.  
12. Plaintiff, fearful of imminent attack, instinctively swerved off the path to avoid what appeared to be a dangerous oncoming animal.  
13. In attempting to evade the loose dog, Plaintiff tripped over a protruding tree root and fell down a small embankment.  
14. Plaintiff sustained a **fractured wrist** as a direct and proximate result of her fall caused by Defendant’s negligent handling of his dog.  
15. Defendant’s dog ultimately stopped at a short distance, and Defendant belatedly recalled it, confirming that the animal had in fact not been securely restrained.  
16. Several bystanders and fellow park visitors witnessed the event and the dog’s off-leash behavior.  
17. Plaintiff sought prompt medical care at a local emergency department, incurring approximately **$3,200** in medical expenses.  
18. Plaintiff was required to wear a wrist brace for several weeks, missed approximately **$1,500** in lost wages due to her inability to work, and suffered pain, inconvenience, and emotional distress as a result of the incident.  
19. At all relevant times, Plaintiff acted reasonably for her own safety and complied with all park rules and laws.  
20. The injuries sustained by Plaintiff were wholly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.

## III. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  

21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully restated herein.  
22. Under Massachusetts law, all persons owe a general duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to others. **Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)**; **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)**.  
23. The owner or keeper of a dog owes a duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent the animal from causing injury to others. **Maillet v. Mininno, 266 Mass. 86 (1929)**; **Anderson v. Kopelman, 279 Mass. 140 (1932)**.  
24. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 140, § 173**, and municipal leash ordinances, Defendant had a duty to maintain control of his dog and to keep it restrained by a leash while on public park property.  
25. Defendant breached that duty by allowing his dog to roam off-leash, despite express signage and statutory requirements mandating restraint.  
26. It was reasonably foreseeable that allowing a large dog to run loose in a public jogging area would cause fear, avoidance reactions, and potential injury to nearby parkgoers. **Brown v. Boston & Maine R.R., 283 Mass. 192 (1933)** (foreseeability defines scope of duty).  
27. Defendant’s breach of duty was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injury. **Stamas v. Fanning, 345 Mass. 73 (1962)** (causation exists where conduct creates foreseeable risk of the type of harm suffered).  
28. The chain of causation was direct and unbroken: Defendant’s negligent supervision caused the dog to charge, Plaintiff reacted in reasonable fear, and she fell, sustaining serious physical injury. **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 284 (1965)**, adopted in **Lyon v. Morphew, 424 Mass. 828 (1997)**.  
29. Plaintiff’s reaction to the apparent danger posed by Defendant’s unleashed dog was reasonable under the “emergency doctrine,” which excuses split-second reactions to sudden peril. **Carroll v. Bouley, 338 Mass. 625 (1959)**.  
30. Defendant’s violation of the applicable leash law and ordinance constitutes negligence per se. **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355 (1990)** (statutory violations as evidence of negligence).  
31. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained damages including, but not limited to, physical injury, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life.  
32. Plaintiff has satisfied all conditions precedent to bringing this action.

## IV. DAMAGES  

33. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date approximate **$3,200**.  
34. Plaintiff has incurred lost wages of approximately **$1,500** due to time missed from employment.  
35. Plaintiff has also endured pain, disability, and emotional distress.  
36. Plaintiff seeks full and fair compensation for all injuries and losses proximately resulting from Defendant’s negligence pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and all applicable law.

## V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Turner** respectfully demands that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Mark Sullivan** as follows:  

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed **$7,000**;  
B. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. For costs and reasonable fees as permitted by law; and  
D. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
