Civil Action No. ___________  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)  

**I. INTRODUCTION**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Collins (“Plaintiff”) brings this complaint against her landlord, Defendant Linda Matthews (“Defendant”), for breach of the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment as provided under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, §14.  
2. This action arises from Defendant’s failure to maintain the leased premises in habitable condition and her interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy, through neglect and denial of responsibility for severe mold growth in the bathroom of Plaintiff’s apartment, causing health problems and loss of property.

**II. PARTIES**

3. Plaintiff **Jessica Collins** is an individual residing and renting an apartment at **123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852**.  
4. Defendant **Linda Matthews** is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns and manages the residential property located at **123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852**, and is the landlord of the premises rented by Plaintiff.

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, §4**, as this is a civil action seeking damages exceeding the jurisdictional amount for the District Court.  
6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, §1**, as the premises and events giving rise to this action occurred in Lowell, which lies in Middlesex County.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease with Defendant for the rental of the premises located at **123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts**.  
8. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the premises since that date and has paid monthly rent of **$1,200**, as required under the lease.  
9. In or around **August 2025**, significant mold growth appeared in the bathroom of the premises, originating in the corner of the shower and spreading across the ceiling.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of this condition and requested remediation.  
11. Defendant inspected the premises but blamed Plaintiff for allegedly failing to run the exhaust fan sufficiently and for taking showers that were “too hot and too long.”  
12. Plaintiff reasonably uses the fan during showers and has no independent means of ventilation, as the bathroom has no window and relies entirely on the fan provided by Defendant.  
13. Despite Plaintiff’s timely notice, Defendant failed to properly remediate the mold or to correct the underlying ventilation issue.  
14. As a direct result of Defendant’s inaction, the mold condition worsened and Plaintiff began experiencing respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which her physician believes are related to mold exposure.  
15. Plaintiff was required to discard contaminated personal property, including a shower curtain and towels, valued at approximately **$60**.  
16. Plaintiff continues to suffer from diminished habitability and loss of enjoyment of the premises due to the persistent mold and Defendant’s refusal to take adequate corrective action.  
17. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every residential tenancy under Massachusetts law.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)**

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord is prohibited from interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises, either directly or indirectly, and is liable for any diminishment in the tenant’s use and enjoyment caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions.  
20. Defendant, by failing to maintain the premises in a habitable and safe condition and by refusing to remedy the mold condition after notice, engaged in conduct that substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and use of the apartment.  
21. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes a constructive eviction and violates **G.L. c. 186, §14**, as well as the implied warranty of habitability recognized under **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)**.  
22. Massachusetts courts have held that persistent failure to correct habitability defects after notice breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment (*Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)).  
23. Landlords are strictly liable for interference with quiet enjoyment resulting from neglect or failure to maintain essential services or sanitary conditions (*Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)).  
24. The mold growth, and Defendant’s refusal to provide remediation or adequate ventilation, constitutes an unlawful interference under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, analogous to other cases where landlords allowed persistent water leaks or vermin infestations (*Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997)).  
25. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, **105 C.M.R. 410.750 and 410.602**, requires landlords to maintain premises free from chronic dampness and mold, and **G.L. c. 111, §127A** authorizes enforcement of these health standards. Violation of the Code may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment (*Hemingway*, supra; *McKenna v. Begin*, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977)).  
26. Defendant’s disregard of these statutory obligations caused Plaintiff to suffer physical harm, property loss, and substantial diminution in the use and enjoyment of her home.  
27. Defendant’s actions were knowing or reckless, entitling Plaintiff to damages, attorney’s fees, and other relief under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  

---

**VI. DAMAGES**

28. Plaintiff has suffered damages including:  
   a. Diminished habitability and use of her apartment;  
   b. Physical discomfort and health impairment due to mold exposure;  
   c. Property losses estimated at **$60**; and  
   d. Emotional distress and inconvenience associated with living in an unsafe environment.  
29. Plaintiff estimates her total damages at least **$200**, exclusive of statutory multipliers, costs, and other relief available under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Collins** respectfully requests that this Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Linda Matthews** for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. Award actual and consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$200**, and up to three months’ rent or three times actual damages pursuant to statute;  
C. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and fees as provided by law;  
D. Order any additional relief this Court deems just and proper.

**VIII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
