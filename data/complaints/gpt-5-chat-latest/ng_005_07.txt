**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a duplex on the same property located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway.  

6. Defendant habitually stored a tall aluminum extension ladder by leaning it unsecured against a wooden fence adjacent to the Plaintiff’s designated parking space in the shared driveway.  

7. In the months preceding March 15, 2023, Plaintiff repeatedly expressed concern to Defendant that the ladder might fall, especially in periods of high wind, and requested that Defendant secure or relocate the ladder.  

8. Defendant assured Plaintiff that he would tie down or move the ladder but failed to do so.  

9. On or about **March 15, 2023**, during a windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, while Plaintiff was backing her car—a personally owned vehicle—into the shared driveway, a gust of wind dislodged the unsecured ladder, causing it to fall.  

10. The ladder struck the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s car, causing a large dent in the hood and cracking the windshield.  

11. The vehicle remained drivable but required professional repair to the hood and replacement of the windshield.  

12. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses, including her insurance deductible and the cost of a rental car while her vehicle was being repaired for over a week.  

13. All damage and consequential loss sustained by Plaintiff were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent storage and failure to secure the ladder despite prior warnings and opportunities to correct the hazard.

**IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE**

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, all persons owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating conditions likely to cause foreseeable injury to others. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  

16. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and storing equipment—including the aluminum ladder—on property jointly used or accessible to Plaintiff. See **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000) (land possessors owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

17. Defendant breached that duty by:  
   a. Leaving a heavy ladder unsecured and leaning in an unstable position subject to wind and gravity;  
   b. Ignoring Plaintiff’s express concerns regarding the foreseeable risk of the ladder falling; and  
   c. Failing to take minimal precautions—such as anchoring, tying, or storing the ladder—in a manner consistent with ordinary care.  

18. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage. See **Kent v. Commonwealth**, 437 Mass. 312 (2002); **Clohessy v. Bachelor**, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 108 (1984).  

19. The harm to Plaintiff was foreseeable; a reasonable person would have anticipated that an unsecured aluminum ladder leaning against a fence near a parking area could fall and cause damage during wind gusts. See **Lev v. Beverly Enterprises–Massachusetts, Inc.**, 457 Mass. 234 (2010); **Poskus v. Boston Hous. Auth.**, 406 Mass. 817 (1990).  

20. The Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law, as described in **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283** (as adopted by Massachusetts courts).  

21. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to: property damage to her vehicle, payment of insurance deductible, rental car expenses, inconvenience, and loss of use of her vehicle. See **Maillet v. ATF-David Corp.**, 407 Mass. 185 (1990) (recognizing recovery for economic and consequential losses proximately caused by negligence).  

22. Plaintiff’s damages were not caused or contributed to by her own negligence.  

23. Plaintiff provided notice to Defendant of the dangerous condition before the event, satisfying the notice requirement for foreseeability under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and relevant common law standards.  

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained damages in an amount reasonably estimated to be in excess of $25,000, including repair and incidental costs.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff **Sarah Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

C. Award prejudgment and post-judgment interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;
