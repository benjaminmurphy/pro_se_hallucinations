# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and Related Authority)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Rachel Bennett**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 for a **Modification of Custody and Parenting Time Order** entered by this Court on April 15, 2019, concerning the parties’ minor child, **Ethan Bennett (age 8)**. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Rachel Bennett, of Bristol County, Massachusetts, mother of the minor child, Ethan Bennett.  
   Address: [Address intentionally omitted for privacy].  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Thomas Bennett, of Bristol County, Massachusetts, father of the minor child, Ethan Bennett.  

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which provides that custody and parenting time orders may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and when such modification serves the best interests of the child.

4. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** under **G.L. c. 208, § 7**, as both parties reside in Bristol County and the original Judgment of Custody issued from this Court.  

---

## III. PRIOR ORDER

5. On **April 15, 2019**, this Court entered an order establishing primary physical custody with the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, and parenting time for the Defendant consisting of three short weekday visits and one Sunday afternoon visit each week, with no overnights.  

6. At the time, the Defendant resided in a shared apartment with roommates and could not provide a suitable overnight environment for the child.

---

## IV. MATERIAL CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the 2019 order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** affecting the minor child's welfare.

8. The minor child, now 8 years old, is a full-time elementary school student with a more structured daily routine, including homework, extracurricular activities, and social needs appropriate for his age.

9. The Defendant, Thomas Bennett, now resides in his own apartment that provides a separate, dedicated bedroom for Ethan Bennett, offering a safe, stable, and appropriate environment for overnight stays.

10. The current visitation schedule—three short weekday visits and a Sunday afternoon—requires the child to be transported back and forth multiple times each week, causing disruption to bedtime and homework routines and increasing stress for both the child and parents.

11. The Plaintiff and Defendant **agree** that the current parenting schedule no longer fits the needs or age of the child and should be modernized to include weekend overnights and fewer midweek transitions.

12. These developments constitute a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties and child as contemplated by **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and justify the requested modification in the child’s best interests.  

---

## V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

13. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and related authorities, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of (a) a real and substantial change in the circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that the modification is in the best interests of the child.  

14. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that stability and the child’s best interests control any modification determination. (*Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)).  

15. The **best interests of the child** standard governs all custody determinations. (*Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)).  

16. Where both parents are fit and a new arrangement better accommodates the developmental stage and schooling of the child, modification has been found appropriate. (*Stevens v. Stevens*, 337 Mass. 625 (1958); *Bodwell v. Brooks*, 148 Mass. App. Ct. 103 (2019)).  

17. The Court’s primary inquiry is the welfare and happiness of the child, not the convenience of the parents. (*Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981)).  

18. In determining the existence of a material change, courts may consider maturation of the child, improved living conditions of a parent, and the child’s evolving needs. (*Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649 (2002)).  

19. In light of the Defendant’s improved housing situation and the shared desire of the parents to provide a more age-appropriate and stable schedule, modification here supports Ethan’s educational, emotional, and developmental well-being and satisfies the statutory requirement of a material and substantial change.

---

## VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

20. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the prior custody order dated April 15, 2019, as follows:

   a. Maintain **joint legal custody**.  
   b. Continue primary physical custody with the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett.  
   c. Modify the Defendant’s parenting time to include **two weekend overnight visits every other week** (e.g., Friday after school through Sunday evening), and **one weekday dinner visit** on non‑overnight weeks, or such schedule as the Court deems appropriate to minimize transitions and support the child’s best interests.  
   d. Adjust holiday and vacation schedules accordingly.  
   e. Provide for such additional or related relief as is just and proper.  

---

## VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior judgment dated April 15, 2019;  
2. Find that a modification of the custody and parenting‑time order is in the **best interests of Ethan Bennett**;  
3. Modify the current custody and parenting plan consistent with the child’s age, schooling, and parental circumstances, as set forth above; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025.**
