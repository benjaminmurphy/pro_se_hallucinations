**COMPLAINT**  
*(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)*  

**I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**  

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Liam Johnson (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Marissa Kent (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) for breach of the statutory and common law covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, arising out of sustained and unreasonable interference caused by Defendant’s renovation activities in an adjacent apartment unit.  

2. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 and 8**, because the premises and events giving rise to this claim occurred in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

**II. PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff **Liam Johnson** is an individual residing at and lawfully occupying the residential rental premises located at **154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138** (the “Premises”).  

4. Defendant **Marissa Kent** is an individual and the owner and lessor of the Premises and adjoining units, conducting business in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  

**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written residential tenancy agreement with Defendant for the Premises, with a monthly rent of **$2,200**.  

6. Plaintiff’s tenancy is and has been in good standing, with rent paid in full and on time.  

7. Beginning approximately **October 1, 2025**, Defendant undertook renovations to the adjacent apartment unit owned and managed by Defendant.  

8. The renovation work has been continuous on most weekdays from approximately **8:00 AM to 5:00 PM**, involving loud drilling, hammering, and workers’ conversations and machinery noise, causing significant disruption.  

9. The construction activities have generated excessive dust and debris, which have infiltrated Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system, diminishing air quality and general comfort in the Premises.  

10. The disturbances have severely interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to carry out his employment from home, as the noise has made it difficult to conduct calls and complete work productively.  

11. Plaintiff complained to Defendant and requested relief. Defendant acknowledged the disruption but provided only a **$100 rent reduction for one month**, which does not reasonably compensate for the continued impact on habitability and enjoyment.  

12. The disruptions have persisted for roughly **two months** and are expected to continue for another one to two months.  

13. As a direct result of Defendant’s conduct and failure to prevent or mitigate the disturbances, Plaintiff has suffered substantial loss of quiet enjoyment of the Premises and seeks **$600** in damages.  

**IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF**  
*(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)*  

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of a tenant and shall be liable for actual and consequential damages resulting from such interference.  

16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in all residential tenancies in Massachusetts and protects tenants from serious and unreasonable interferences materially affecting their tenancy. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 716–718 (1977) (landlord liable when disturbances caused by his actions substantially interfered with tenant’s use of premises).  

17. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under both statutory and common law. *See* **O’Brien v. Hurley**, 325 Mass. 285, 287 (1950) (quiet enjoyment breached where landlord’s conduct rendered premises less fit for occupancy).  

18. Defendant, by directing and permitting extensive construction activities adjacent to Plaintiff’s unit and failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate excessive noise, dust, and disruption, has “directly or indirectly interfered” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. *See* **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (landlord liable for disturbances caused by his actions or those under his control).  

19. The severity and duration of the interference were unreasonable in the circumstances, especially in light of Plaintiff’s residential working needs and Defendant’s inadequate ameliorative measures. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994) (material interference with comfort and safety constitutes breach).  

20. Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment includes freedom from unreasonable disturbance, excessive noise, and intrusions by dust or contaminants materially affecting the habitability of the dwelling. *See* **Anderson v. Gabriel**, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 436, 440 (1998); **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973).  

21. The fact that the construction occurred during standard working hours does not preclude a finding of breach where, as here, the result was a consistent and substantial impairment of use of the premises. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 101 (1982) (persistent disturbance and interference sufficient even if arising during reasonable periods).  

22. The modest rent abatement offered by Defendant does not cure the violation, as the harm to Plaintiff’s comfort and use continued unabated. *See* **Winchester Constr. Co. v. Miller**, 117 Mass. 283, 285 (1875) (tenant entitled to damages where interference persisted despite notice).  

23. Defendant’s conduct also constitutes an “indirect interference” under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, notwithstanding the fact that the renovation served a legitimate purpose. *See* **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 200 (1979) (liability for acts done with landlord’s consent or under landlord’s direction causing interference).  

24. Plaintiff has suffered measurable damages, including lost enjoyment, inconvenience, stress, and interference with his ability to perform work, in an amount reasonably estimated at **$600**, plus interest and costs.  

**V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Liam Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Marissa Kent**;  
B. Award damages in the amount of **$600** for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, or such other amount as the evidence at trial may prove;  
C. Award reasonable court costs and statutory interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6C**; and  
D. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
