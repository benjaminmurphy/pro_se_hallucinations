**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On **September 20, 2023**, Plaintiff visited Defendant’s store located at 1230 Main Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, as a lawful business invitee and customer.  

7. In the kitchenware aisle, Defendant had stacked numerous heavy boxes of appliances—including toaster ovens—five or six high on upper shelves without any security straps, rails, or other restraints.  

8. The configuration of the shelving and the unsecured stacking of heavy merchandise created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of injury to customers.  

9. While Plaintiff was standing in the aisle, another customer’s cart made minor contact with a lower shelf, causing one of the upper appliance boxes to fall.  

10. The falling box struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and the side of her head, causing immediate dizziness, pain, and headache.  

11. Defendant’s store manager arrived, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.  

12. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened. She presented to a local emergency department, where she was diagnosed with a **mild concussion and shoulder strain**.  

13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses related to emergency treatment, follow-up care, and therapy.  

14. She also lost approximately **$1,200** in wages due to missed work as a delivery driver.  

15. Plaintiff experienced significant pain, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to play in her weekly soccer league for approximately one month.

**V. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, storeowners owe a duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition for invited customers and to protect them from foreseeable risks of harm. *See* **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331 (1983); **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 297 N.E.2d 43 (1973).  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to ensure merchandise and shelving were secure and safe. *See* **Deagle v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263, 178 N.E.2d 286 (1961).  

19. Defendant breached that duty by:  
   a. Stacking heavy merchandise in an unsafe and unstable manner;  
   b. Failing to use restraints, rails, or warning signs;  
   c. Failing to inspect and correct hazardous display conditions; and  
   d. Failing to provide adequate employee supervision and training.  

20. Defendant knew or should have known that the stacking of boxes posed a foreseeable risk of falling objects injuring customers. *See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 930 N.E.2d 142 (2010).  

21. Defendant’s failure to maintain its premises in a safe condition was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 849 N.E.2d 829 (2006).  

22. Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety and did not contribute to the occurrence. *See* **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence standard).  

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages: medical expenses, lost wages, physical pain, emotional distress, and loss of normal life activities. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540, 437 N.E.2d 171 (1982).  

24. Defendant’s conduct amounts to a breach of the duty of reasonable care under **G.L. c. 231, § 85A**, and relevant Massachusetts negligence principles. *See also* **Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.**, 430 Mass. 694, 723 N.E.2d 655 (2000); **Banaghan v. Dewey**, 340 Mass. 73, 162 N.E.2d 807 (1959); **Bohan v. Ritacco**, 449 Mass. 101, 865 N.E.2d 415 (2007); **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343 & 343A**, adopted in *Poirier v. Plymouth*, 374 Mass. 206, 372 N.E.2d 212 (1978).
