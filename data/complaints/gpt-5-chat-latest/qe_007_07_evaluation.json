While the case focuses on constructive eviction and on when a landlord\u2019s conduct breaches that covenant, its reasoning assumes\u2014as an underlying premise\u2014that such a covenant is implied in the tenancy. The court does not, however, expressly state in so many words that the covenant is implied in every tenancy, which slightly lowers confidence.",

He ruled that the tenants\u2019 implied warranty of quiet enjoyment was violated by late evening and early morning music and disturbances coming from nearby premises which the landlords leased to others for use as a bar or cocktail lounge (lounge). The landlords argue that they did not violate the tenants\u2019 implied covenant of quiet enjoyment because they are not chargeable with the noise from the lounge."

The court emphasizes that malicious or specific intent is not required and that the statute covers at least reckless conduct, based on foreseeability of harm from unsanitary flooding conditions; this fits the idea that failure to protect a tenant from foreseeable disruptions can amount to a constructive breach of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019\u2026 Although early cases applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment required intent on the part of the landlord\u2026 more recent decisions have imposed liability whenever the \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of a landlord\u2019s action was interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights.\u2026 When the Legislature chose the words \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019\u2026 it must have intended to incorporate these cases into the statute.\u201d"

Instead, it holds that at least negligent conduct and landlord notice are required to establish a \u00a7 14 violation, and it ultimately finds no quiet enjoyment liability here. Thus, it does not support the specific proposition about substantial and unreasonable interference with residential use.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

Instead, the court affirms a defense verdict, explicitly rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s quiet enjoyment and lease-based theories because negligence was not proven, and upholds a directed verdict on the implied warranty of habitability claim. The decision thus denies, rather than affirms, any entitlement to such damages on these facts.",

It does not discuss a tenant\u2019s right to peaceful use or quiet enjoyment, landlord-controlled disturbances, or breach of the statutory covenant absent ill intent.
