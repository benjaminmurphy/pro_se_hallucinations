(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Morgan**, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, **Thomas Reed**, is an individual and landlord doing business in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, who owns and manages residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as the property and the events at issue are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in Springfield District Court because the leased premises are situated within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **May 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease agreement with Defendant for an apartment located at **123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts** (the “Premises”).  
6. The monthly rent agreed upon was **$1,600.00**.  
7. Plaintiff has continuously paid rent in a timely manner and otherwise complied with all lease obligations.  
8. Beginning in or around **mid-October 2025**, one of the bedrooms in the Premises lost electrical power: the outlets ceased functioning, and the overhead light no longer worked.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition.  
10. Defendant arranged for an electrician to inspect the problem. The electrician advised that significant repairs were required to restore proper electrical service to the affected room.  
11. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to complete necessary repairs and restore electricity for more than six weeks, and as of **December 1, 2025**, the condition remains unresolved.  
12. As a result, Plaintiff has been unable to use the second bedroom for its intended purpose as a home office.  
13. Plaintiff has incurred expenses to maintain her ability to work, including approximately **$15 per day** spent purchasing food and coffee at local cafes for workspace, and a **$150-per-month coworking space membership**.  
14. Plaintiff’s work equipment, files, and furniture have been displaced into the living area, significantly reducing the habitability, comfort, and enjoyment of the apartment.  
15. Plaintiff notified Defendant repeatedly of these ongoing conditions, but Defendant failed to make timely and adequate repairs.  
16. Defendant’s failure to restore basic electrical service has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and constitutes a breach of the **covenant of quiet enjoyment** implied by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
17. Plaintiff has suffered consequential and actual damages, including but not limited to loss of use, emotional distress, inconvenience, and out-of-pocket costs estimated at **$1,200** or more.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I – Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17 above.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises.  
20. Defendant’s failure to maintain electrical service and to repair defective wiring in a timely manner constitutes an “act or omission” that interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
21. The breach of this statute gives rise to statutory damages and reasonable attorney’s fees, even when the tenant proceeds pro se.  

**Applicable Law and Supporting Authorities**

22. Massachusetts recognizes an **implied covenant of quiet enjoyment** in every residential tenancy. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714, 715–17 (1977)** (landlord’s failure to prevent unreasonable interference with tenant’s enjoyment constitutes breach).  
23. Landlord liability arises from both affirmative acts and omissions. *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982)** (persistent water leakage and failure to repair housing defects constitute breach).  
24. The covenant protects tenants against “substantial interference with the tenants’ beneficial enjoyment of the premises.” *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994)**.  
25. Failure to repair essential services such as electricity, heat, or water constitutes a breach. *Winchester v. O’Brien*, **266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929)** (failure to provide utilities amounts to constructive eviction); *Berman & Sons v. Perlman*, **343 Mass. 547, 551 (1962)** (landlord responsible for maintenance affecting habitability).  
26. The statute, **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, expressly provides that any landlord who “interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment… either directly or indirectly,” is liable for actual and statutory damages.  
27. Massachusetts courts consistently hold landlords liable under this section for failing to repair serious defects. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847, 853 (1997)** (reiterating statutory basis for damages when landlord fails to maintain habitable premises).  
28. The duty is nondelegable; landlords cannot excuse performance by citing contractor or structural delays. *Young v. Patukonis*, **24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 909 (1987)**.  
29. The existence of unsafe or unusable rooms is sufficient interference even absent total deprivation of possession. *Lowery v. Robinson*, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**.  
30. The covenant exists independently of and in addition to any contractual lease obligations. *Hemingway v. Boston Housing Auth.*, **363 Mass. 184, 198–202 (1973)**.  
31. Because Defendant’s conduct meets the statutory standard of interference, Plaintiff is entitled to recover statutory and actual damages under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, as well as equitable relief.  
32. Defendant’s omissions caused Plaintiff undue expenses and personal hardship that were foreseeable results of Defendant’s failure to maintain safe and functional electrical service.

C. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and any allowable attorney’s fees under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
D. Order Defendant to promptly complete all necessary repairs to restore full electrical functionality to the leased premises and prevent further interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment; and
