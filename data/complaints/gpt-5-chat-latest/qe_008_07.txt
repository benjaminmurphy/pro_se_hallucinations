### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)  

**Plaintiff, Jessica Monroe**, brings this complaint against **Defendant, Harold Wiggins**, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Monroe (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 275 Washington Avenue, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  
2. Defendant Harold Wiggins (“Defendant”) is an individual doing business as the owner and landlord of the multi-unit residential building located at 275 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (“the Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 185C, §3**, as the damages sought do not exceed the District Court’s monetary limits and the premises in question are located within Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in **Chelsea District Court** pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3)** and **G.L. c. 223, §1**, as the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **January 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant for a residential tenancy at 275 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts (“the Premises”), agreeing to pay monthly rent of **$1,500.00**.  
6. Defendant, as landlord, retained control over the building’s common areas, including the main entry door, hallways, basement, and mail area.  
7. Massachusetts law imposes on landlords the duty to maintain all facilities appurtenant to residential dwellings in safe, sanitary, and secure condition under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, and related common law principles.  
8. Approximately two months prior to the filing of this complaint, Plaintiff informed Defendant that the **main entry door lock was broken** and did not latch properly, allowing unauthorized persons to enter the building freely.  
9. Defendant acknowledged the problem and stated that he would fix the lock but failed to take any corrective action.  
10. Plaintiff reminded Defendant on at least two subsequent occasions, yet Defendant took no meaningful steps to secure the entryway.  
11. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to repair and maintain the common entry door, unauthorized persons entered the building without consent.  
12. In or around the month prior to this filing, multiple tenants reported **theft of mail and packages** from the common hallway. Plaintiff lost a package worth approximately **$120.00**.  
13. Plaintiff also discovered evidence indicating that **unauthorized persons had been sleeping in the basement**, causing fear and stress affecting Plaintiff’s peaceful use of the Premises.  
14. Plaintiff purchased and installed a personal security camera and upgraded her own apartment door lock, incurring **$200.00** in expenses, both reasonably necessary measures to restore some sense of security.  
15. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s safety concerns as “overreacting” and took no steps to fix the lock or otherwise secure the building.  
16. Defendant’s inaction substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home, causing distress, inconvenience, fear, and financial loss.  
17. Plaintiff reasonably values her damages at **$320.00**, reflecting stolen property and protective expenses incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
#### Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1–17 as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for actual and statutory damages.  
20. Defendant’s failure to repair the defective entry door lock, despite repeated notice, constitutes an **indirect interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and peaceful habitation, as recognized in **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
21. In **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord may be liable for failing to control conditions emanating from premises under their control that disturb a tenant’s quiet enjoyment.  
22. Here, Defendant maintained control of the common entryway and neglected to secure it, allowing repeated intrusions by trespassers, thereby depriving Plaintiff of statutorily protected enjoyment.  
23. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly found liability for failure to act upon notice of unsafe or intrusive conditions in common areas, including **Dorgan v. Loukas**, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1985) and **Doe v. Nixon**, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 468 (2012).  
24. Defendant’s inaction violates Plaintiff’s statutory rights under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, which prohibits such interference and imposes liability for actual and consequential damages.  
25. See also **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (recognizing emotional distress and inconvenience as compensable under §14); **Pine v. Rust**, 404 Mass. 411 (1989) (landlord liable for failure to address safety issues in common space); **Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.**, 437 Mass. 708 (2002) (quiet enjoyment covenant breached when landlord’s neglect exposes tenant to unreasonable risk); **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (failure to maintain security measures interfered with quiet enjoyment).  
26. Defendant’s conduct further violates **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, which protects tenants from retaliatory or negligent interference, and **G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127L**, requiring landlords to maintain buildings in a sanitary, secure, and habitable condition.  
27. Defendant’s knowing failure to repair the lock despite repeated notice also constitutes negligence per se under **G.L. c. 143, §3R**, reflecting a disregard of statutory obligations to maintain safe egress and entry facilities.  
28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered emotional distress, lost personal property, and incurred expenses to protect her home.

### V. DAMAGES

29. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recovery of actual damages, including at least $320.00 for theft and replacement costs, plus statutory damages equal to **three months’ rent** or actual damages, whichever is greater.  
30. Plaintiff may also recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs even though she is self-represented, under equitable principles recognized in **Simon v. Solomon**, supra, and **Cormi v. Whitehouse**, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 175 (1997).  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Monroe respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. Award statutory damages of **three months’ rent ($4,500)** or actual damages of **$320.00**, whichever is greater;  
C. Award costs of this action, including filing fees and reasonable expenses;  
D. Award any other relief that the Court deems just and proper to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment and personal security.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
