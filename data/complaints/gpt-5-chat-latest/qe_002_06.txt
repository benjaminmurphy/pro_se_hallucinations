### **COMPLAINT**

---

#### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Moore**, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  
2. The Defendant, **Linda Johnson**, upon information and belief, is an individual and landlord with a usual place of business or residence in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the owner and lessor of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  

---

#### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This action arises under the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Boston Housing Court** pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as the premises are located within the City of Boston and the cause of action arose therein.  
5. This Court has jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 239**, **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, and **G.L. c. 231, § 1**, as the Plaintiff seeks damages for the Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

#### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about **March 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for a residential basement unit located at **123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119**.  
7. The lease has continued on a monthly basis, with rent of **$1,200 per month**.  
8. Plaintiff has at all times used and occupied the premises as her primary residence and has substantially complied with the terms of the tenancy.  
9. In **October 2025**, Plaintiff experienced temporary financial hardship due to medical expenses and paid her rent approximately two (2) weeks late, including the required late fee.  
10. In **November 2025**, Plaintiff discovered that water was seeping into the basement unit through the foundation wall during heavy rain, causing property damage and creating hazardous conditions.  
11. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message of the water intrusion. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but took no corrective action.  
12. After several weeks without repair, Plaintiff contacted the **City of Boston Inspectional Services Department**, which inspected the premises and cited violations of the state and city housing codes, including water infiltration and dampness in violation of **105 C.M.R. 410.500** and **G.L. c. 111, § 127A**.  
13. The water intrusion damaged Plaintiff’s belongings, including a rug and bookshelf valued at approximately **$400.00**, and increased Plaintiff’s electric utility costs due to the continuous use of a dehumidifier to mitigate dampness.  
14. Following the inspection, Defendant accused Plaintiff of being a “problem tenant” and informed her that her lease would **not be renewed in March 2026**, allegedly because of the prior late payment, though the timing and circumstances suggest retaliation related to her code complaint and the inspection.  
15. Defendant has failed and refused to remedy the water infiltration, which continues to interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the premises.  
16. The defective conditions and Defendant’s inaction substantially impaired the character and value of the leased premises, forced Plaintiff to endure persistent dampness, and rendered portions of the unit uninhabitable.

#### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every landlord is obligated not to “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.”  
19. Defendant’s failure to remedy the water intrusion and related housing code violations constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when a landlord, by act or omission, allows conditions to persist that cause the tenant substantial interference with the use of the premises. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
21. Landlords are liable for constructive interference resulting from their failure to correct defective conditions. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
22. Persistent water leakage and dampness have been held to breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
23. Defendant’s inaction after repeated notice constitutes a **continuing breach**, see **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
24. Plaintiff has suffered both property damage and personal inconvenience and distress as a result of these violations.  
25. Defendant’s conduct was willful, knowing, or at least negligent in permitting the uncorrected conditions to continue, satisfying the requirements for liability under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

26. The following authorities support Plaintiff’s claim:

   e. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) — Mental distress damages permissible for breach of quiet enjoyment.  
   f. **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) — Landlord’s inaction after notice constitutes constructive eviction and breach.

   h. **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) — Reaffirming tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
   i. **Leardi v. Brown**, 394 Mass. 151 (1985) — Tenant entitled to statutory damages for breach of rights under c. 186, § 14.
