Noise is mentioned only incidentally as part of the plaintiffs\u2019 description of drug activity, and the Court\u2019s legal analysis and holding focus on the landlord\u2019s failure to take measures to remove unlawful actors, not on noise as a standalone basis for breach. Thus, this opinion does not provide authority for the specific proposition that continuous unreasonable noise can constitute substantial interference breaching quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn this case, we have no doubt that, if the plaintiffs truly are unable to use the common areas of the development, including sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and recreation areas within it, then the situation constitutes a serious interference with their quiet enjoyment and substantially impairs the character of the leased premises\u2026. If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

It does not discuss quiet enjoyment, nuisance, or noise, nor does it address whether continuous, unreasonable noise can be a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. Citing Williams v. Seder for that specific quiet-enjoyment/noise proposition is therefore inaccurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "A tenancy at will arises out of an agreement, express or implied, by which one uses and occupies the premises of another for a consideration \u2014 usually the payment of rent. The relation between the tenant and the landlord is contractual. \u2026 The notices purporting to increase the rent were not notices to quit, and the plaintiff never expressed any intent to have the tenant vacate her premises. \u2026 The terms of the existing tenancy could not be changed and a new tenancy at will be substituted for the former tenancy unless with the mutual assent of the parties."
