### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jordan Mitchell** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  
2. Defendant **Samantha Baker** (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”), which she rents to the Plaintiff.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction lies with the **Boston Housing Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3, 6, as this action concerns rights and obligations arising from a residential tenancy located within the City of Boston.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Roxbury, Suffolk County.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **March 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to lease the basement apartment at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. Plaintiff has resided continuously in the Premises since that date and has paid rent as required, except for a two-week delay in October 2025, which was cured in full along with any applicable late fee.  
7. Starting in **November 2025**, substantial **water seepage** began entering the basement apartment through the foundation wall during rainfall.  
8. Plaintiff notified Defendant promptly by text message, and Defendant responded she would “look into it,” but failed to take any steps to repair or mitigate the problem.  
9. By late November 2025, the water intrusion persisted, damaging Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and bookshelf, valued at approximately **$400**.  
10. Plaintiff contacted the **City of Boston Inspectional Services Department** (“ISD”), which inspected the Premises and cited water intrusion and other code violations under the **Massachusetts State Sanitary Code**, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.  
11. Following that inspection, Defendant became hostile toward Plaintiff, referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and informing Plaintiff that the lease would not be renewed at its March 2026 expiration.  
12. Defendant’s stated reason for nonrenewal was Plaintiff’s October rent delay; however, the timing of the decision immediately after the ISD inspection suggests retaliatory and improper motive.  
13. As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed and refused to correct the water intrusion, causing ongoing damage, increased electricity costs due to continuous dehumidifier operation, and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of rented premises is liable for actual and consequential damages, or a minimum of three months’ rent, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
16. The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is also recognized under **Massachusetts common law**, see *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 101–02 (1982), and assures that a tenant’s lawful possession will not be substantially disturbed by the landlord’s acts or omissions.  
17. Defendant violated this covenant by failing to remedy persistent water intrusion after notice, thereby allowing conditions unfit for human habitation in violation of the **State Sanitary Code**, 105 C.M.R. § 410.750, et seq.  
18. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes an **“interference with quiet enjoyment”** within the meaning of *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 717–18 (1977), and subsequent cases.  
19. Defendant’s conduct was not merely negligent but demonstrated disregard for Plaintiff’s right to habitable and peaceful occupancy.  
20. Defendant’s decision to withhold lease renewal and label Plaintiff a “problem tenant” after Plaintiff sought official code enforcement further compounded the interference, discouraging Plaintiff from exercising protected rights under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and **G.L. c. 239, § 2A** (retaliation protections).  
21. The **continued flooding**, damage to personal property, elevated humidity, and related expenses collectively constitute substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.  
22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered:  
   a. Damage to personal property of approximately **$400**;  
   b. Increased electricity costs;  
   c. Emotional stress, inconvenience, and diminished use of the Premises; and  
   d. Violation of statutory and common-law rights.

### V. LEGAL SUPPORT AND AUTHORITIES

Defendant’s actions violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment as interpreted in the following authorities, among others:

- **G.L. c. 186, § 14** (quiet enjoyment statute).  
- **G.L. c. 239, § 2A** (retaliatory eviction protections).  
- **105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.** (State Sanitary Code – Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).  
- *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for acts interfering with tenant’s use).  
- *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (failure to remedy persistent flooding breaches covenant).  
- *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (quiet enjoyment extends to failure to act on known defects).  
- *Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.*, 437 Mass. 708 (2002) (breach of covenant may arise from omissions).  
- *Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004) (landlord liability for allowing uninhabitable conditions).  
- *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (sanitary code violations establish per se breach).  
- *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (tenant protected for reporting sanitary code violations).  
- *Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 342 Mass. 692 (1961) (recognizing implied obligations of habitability).

Each of these statutes and decisions reinforces that a landlord’s failure to maintain habitable conditions, after notice, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
