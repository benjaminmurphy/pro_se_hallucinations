The quoted concurring passage criticizes retaining a separate rule for trespassers, which implicitly acknowledges that the majority opinion extends a reasonable-care duty to all non\u2011trespassing entrants. Although the excerpt is from a concurrence and focused on trespassers, it is consistent with and presupposes the majority\u2019s holding that occupiers owe reasonable care to all lawful visitors regarding foreseeable injuries.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""
