### COMPLAINT  
*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)*

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Laura Simmons** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  
2. Defendant **David Thompson** (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, which grants the Housing Court jurisdiction over all civil actions involving the health, safety, or welfare of occupants of residential housing, including claims arising under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the property that is the subject of this action is located within Boston and the alleged acts occurred within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **February 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent a studio apartment at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, for a monthly rent of **$1,500**.  
6. During the pre-lease showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the apartment ceiling and asked Defendant about them.  
7. Defendant represented that the stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”  
8. Plaintiff relied upon that representation in deciding to rent the apartment.  
9. Beginning shortly after Plaintiff moved in, water began to leak through the ceiling during rainstorms in the same area where the stains appeared.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leaks multiple times, both orally and in writing.  
11. Defendant repeatedly dismissed the issue, calling it a “minor cosmetic issue” and asserting that the apartment had “character.”  
12. The leaks worsened over time, particularly during heavy rainstorms, causing water damage to Plaintiff’s couch and to a laptop valued at approximately **$900**.  
13. Plaintiff also began to notice a musty odor and experienced headaches that she reasonably believes are related to mold growth caused by continuing moisture intrusion.  
14. The ongoing water intrusion, odor, and damage have rendered a significant portion of the apartment uninhabitable, forcing Plaintiff to rearrange her sleeping area and to avoid the affected portion of the unit.  
15. Defendant has failed and refused to make adequate repairs despite repeated notice and opportunity to cure.  
16. As a result, Plaintiff has been deprived of the full, peaceful, and beneficial enjoyment of the rented premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Massachusetts law implies a **covenant of quiet enjoyment** in every residential tenancy, codified at **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which prohibits landlords from “directly or indirectly interfering with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”  
19. Defendant’s failure to remedy significant water leaks and resulting habitability issues constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  
20. The breach did not arise from mere negligence but from willful indifference and neglect after repeated notice of the condition.  
21. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that unremedied water intrusion, defective conditions, or failure to maintain habitable premises constitute violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
   - **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord’s conduct or inaction that substantially interferes with tenant’s enjoyment constitutes breach);  
   - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (persistent flooding and landlord’s failure to correct it constituted breach under G.L. c. 186, § 14);  
   - **Davis v. Comerford**, 483 Mass. 164 (2019) (retaliatory or neglectful acts that disturb tenant’s possession violate § 14);  
   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (statute imposes liability where interference results from landlord’s acts or omissions);  
   - **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (failure to maintain habitable conditions may amount to deprivation of quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Alfano v. Donnelly**, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 310 (1995) (landlord liable for breach where defective roof caused continuing water intrusion);  
   - **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (tenant entitled to damages for acts interfering with occupancy);  
   - **Wesson v. Leone Enters.**, 437 Mass. 708 (2002) (interpreting covenant of quiet enjoyment to protect tenant from material interference);  
   - **G.L. c. 186, § 14** (statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment); and  
   - **G.L. c. 239, § 8A** (providing defense and counterclaim remedies for breach of quiet enjoyment and habitability).  
22. Defendant’s repeated failure and refusal to correct the leak, despite notice and opportunity, violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment and entitles Plaintiff to statutory and actual damages.  
23. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Defendant is liable for **actual damages or three months’ rent**, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (the latter requested as self-represented litigant costs).

### V. DAMAGES

24. Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to:  
   a. Property damage totaling approximately **$900**;  
   b. Diminished value and enjoyment of the premises;  
   c. Physical discomfort and emotional distress caused by persistent leaks, musty odor, and disruption of daily living; and  
   d. Statutory damages as provided under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** (three months’ rent = $4,500).  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Enter judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;  
2. Award Plaintiff statutory damages pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14** in the amount of three months’ rent ($4,500) or actual damages as determined by the Court, whichever is greater;  
3. Award Plaintiff the value of damaged property totaling approximately $900;  
4. Order Defendant to remediate all water intrusion and mold conditions, ensuring the apartment is brought into compliance with **State Sanitary Code 105 CMR 410.000** and **G.L. c. 111, § 127L**;  
5. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs of suit and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
