### I. INTRODUCTION

This is a civil action for negligence arising out of a slip-and-fall injury sustained by the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, while shopping in the Defendant’s grocery store located in Somerville, Massachusetts. The Defendant failed to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, failed to warn Plaintiff of a known dangerous condition, and thereby caused Plaintiff’s injuries.

---

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 16, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully upon the premises of Fresh Foods Grocery as a business invitee, shopping in the ordinary course of business.

6. While walking in the dairy aisle of the store, Plaintiff stepped into a visible puddle of spilled milk on the floor and fell to the ground, landing on her left hip.

7. The puddle was large enough to show visible shopping cart tracks through it, indicating the hazard had been present for a significant period of time prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

8. No “Wet Floor” warnings, cones, or barriers were present in or around the area where the milk had been spilled.

9. A store employee was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away from the spill at the time of Plaintiff’s fall.

10. After the incident, the same employee stated he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but had continued stocking shelves and planned to retrieve a mop later.

11. At all relevant times, Defendant and its agents and employees owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a business invitee, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a safe condition and to warn of known or reasonably discoverable hazards.

12. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to remove, clean, or warn customers of the hazardous condition.

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered a painful hip sprain, required medical treatment, incurred reasonable medical expenses in the approximate amount of **$1,200**, lost wages in the approximate amount of **$800**, and endured pain and suffering.

14. Plaintiff continues to experience discomfort and limitations as a result of the injuries sustained from the fall.

### V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. The Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep its premises in a condition reasonably safe for use by its customers, in accordance with Massachusetts law. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 784–85 (2007).

17. Defendant breached that duty by failing to (a) properly inspect the store aisles, (b) timely clean or remove the spill, and (c) warn Plaintiff and other customers of the dangerous condition. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).

18. A property owner or occupant is liable for injuries caused by hazards of which it knew or should have known through reasonable care. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010); *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264 (1961).

19. The store employee’s admission that he knew of the spill but delayed remedying it constitutes actual notice of the hazardous condition. *Wolfson v. Foxborough Housing Auth.*, 490 Mass. 706, 709 (2019) (actual knowledge creates duty to act reasonably).

20. Even in the absence of actual notice, the Defendant had constructive notice, as the tracks through the puddle indicated the hazard existed long enough that Defendant, exercising reasonable diligence, should have discovered and corrected it. *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.*, 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955).

21. Defendant’s failure to take prompt remedial action breached the standard of ordinary care required of a commercial premises operator. *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84, 88 (1988).

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries and losses for which Defendant is liable under common-law negligence principles and G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute).

23. The Defendant’s wrongful conduct was the substantial factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s injuries, consistent with the principles of proximate causation under Massachusetts law. *Joye v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 405 Mass. 69, 73 (1989).

24. As a result, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer from pain, medical expenses, lost wages, and limitation in daily activities.

### VI. DAMAGES

25. Plaintiff has incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses for treatment, physical therapy, and related care arising from the incident.

26. Plaintiff has lost approximately **$800** in wages due to missed work at her place of employment.

27. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience pain, suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, all proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.

28. Plaintiff seeks compensation for all reasonable damages, including but not limited to medical costs, lost wages, and fair compensation for pain and suffering under Massachusetts law. *Conley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.*, 405 Mass. 168, 172 (1989); *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 549 (1982).
