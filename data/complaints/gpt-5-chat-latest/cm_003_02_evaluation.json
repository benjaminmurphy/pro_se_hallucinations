However, the court does not frame its remedy as imposing \"visitation conditions or supervision\" in the sense of supervised visitation or structured safety conditions; instead it imposes content-based restrictions on religious exposure while otherwise leaving visitation intact. The case thus supports the idea that a court may limit aspects of visitation to protect a child\u2019s emotional stability, but it is not authority specifically on supervision or broader visitation-conditions as such.",
