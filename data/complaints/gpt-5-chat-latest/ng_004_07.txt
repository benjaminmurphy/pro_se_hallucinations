### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff **Jessica Morales**, by and for herself, alleges as follows against Defendant **Tracy Hargrove**:  

---

## I. PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Morales** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Her contact information is: (617) 555‑0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. Defendant **Tracy Hargrove** (“Defendant”) is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns and manages the residential property located at **123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts**, a three‑unit apartment building.  

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, §4**, which confers jurisdiction upon the Superior Court over civil actions for damages exceeding $25,000.  

4. Venue is proper in Worcester County pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, §8**, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester, and the property at issue is located there.  

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about **February 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully upon the sidewalk at or near **123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts**, delivering groceries to one of the tenants of Defendant’s building.  

6. At that time, and in the days immediately following a snowstorm earlier that week, Defendant, as the owner of the property, had an ongoing duty to take reasonable measures to maintain the sidewalk abutting her property in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and invitees.  

7. Following the snowstorm, Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply salt, sand, or any other material to prevent refreezing and ice buildup.  

8. As a result, melting during the daytime and refreezing during the nighttime caused the shoveled path to become covered with a hard sheet of ice.  

9. Tenants of the property reportedly notified Defendant about the ice hazard, including sending her photographs, and Defendant allegedly responded that “the sun will take care of it.”  

10. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff walked along the sidewalk, unaware of the full extent of the icy condition.  

11. Plaintiff slipped on the ice, fell backward, and landed heavily on her lower back, sustaining physical injury.  

12. Plaintiff required medical treatment for her injuries, incurring approximately **$1,500** in medical expenses.  

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff also lost approximately **$1,000** in wages while recovering from her injuries.  

14. Plaintiff has suffered pain, discomfort, and inconvenience and continues to endure physical limitations as a result of the fall.  

---

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE  

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain her premises, including the abutting sidewalk under her control, in a reasonably safe condition to prevent foreseeable harm to lawful visitors, invitees, and others lawfully upon the property.  
   * See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (landlord owes duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).  

17. Defendant breached that duty by failing to take reasonable measures to remove or treat the hazardous ice and by failing to warn foreseeable visitors of the danger presented.  
   * See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (abolishing natural accumulation rule and holding property owners liable for failure to remove snow and ice with reasonable care).  

18. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care required of reasonable property owners under the circumstances.  
   * See **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) (landowners must act reasonably with respect to snow and ice removal).  

19. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.  
   * See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages).  

20. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries were foreseeable and preventable had Defendant acted with ordinary care.  
   * See **Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637 (1996).  

21. Defendant had actual and constructive notice of the dangerous icy condition, having been notified by tenants with photographs prior to Plaintiff’s accident, but failed to act.  
   * See **Thompson v. Forest Hills Gardens Co.**, 478 Mass. 1001 (2017) (landlord found liable where notice of ice accumulation was evident).  

22. Defendant’s failure to maintain the sidewalk and her disregard for tenant complaints constitute actionable negligence under Massachusetts law.  
   * See **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); **Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.**, 400 Mass. 837 (1987).  

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered serious pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages.  
   * See **Foley v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 400 Mass. 821 (1987) (damages recoverable for personal injuries proximately caused by negligence).  

24. Plaintiff continues to experience ongoing discomfort and disruption to her normal activities as a result of Defendant’s negligence.  
   * See **Ward v. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co.**, 418 Mass. 486 (1994).
