While the facts involve flooding rather than lack of heat, the decision\u2019s reasoning is not limited to water leaks; it broadly states that unsanitary conditions causing serious interference with tenancy and resulting personal injury are within \u00a7 14\u2019s scope.

The SJC affirms that the landlord\u2019s failure to repair serious, recurring defects after notice can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment under \u00a7 14, yet there is no discussion of heat, nor a specific holding that failure to maintain adequate heat constitutes constructive interference.
