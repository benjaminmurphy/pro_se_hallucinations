# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208 § 28; G.L. c. 209C § 20)

---

### I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Laura Mitchell**, resides in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Her phone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email is psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. The Defendant, **James Carter**, resides in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, having recently relocated to Cape Cod.  

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child: **Sophie Carter**, born [date omitted for privacy], age 8.  

4. This action is brought pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28**, and related provisions of **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, § 6**, requesting modification of an existing custody order issued by this Court on **October 15, 2019**.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. The **Barnstable Probate and Family Court** retains continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters pursuant to G.L. c. 208 § 28 and G.L. c. 215 § 6.  

6. Venue is proper because the Plaintiff and the minor child reside in Barnstable County and the prior order originated from this Court.

---

### III. PRIOR ORDER

7. Pursuant to the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered October 15, 2019, the Plaintiff was awarded **primary physical custody** of the minor child, with the Defendant having parenting time **every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays**.

8. At the time that order was issued, both parties resided in the same town, and the child’s school was within approximately five minutes of both households.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2019 order, the Defendant, James Carter, has **moved approximately ninety (90) miles** from the child’s school to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  

10. Despite this significant relocation, the Defendant continues to insist upon exercising the **Wednesday overnight parenting time** as previously ordered.  

11. To comply with that schedule, the Defendant picks up the child after school on Wednesday, drives to Cape Cod, and awakens the child around **4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings** to drive her back to school.  

12. As a result, the child arrives to school sleep‑deprived and fatigued, which has **negatively affected her classroom participation and performance**, as confirmed by her teacher.  

13. The child’s consistent exhaustion on Thursdays constitutes a **substantial and material change of circumstances** adversely affecting her well‑being and stability.  

14. The current midweek overnight **no longer serves the child’s best interests** and is incompatible with her educational and developmental needs.

---

### V. LEGAL STANDARD

15. Under **G.L. c. 208 § 28**, a custody or visitation order may be modified “upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  

16. Massachusetts courts apply a two‑part test: (a) whether there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the last order; and (b) whether the proposed modification is **in the child’s best interests**. *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

17. In evaluating best interests, the Court considers the child’s stability, schooling, emotional needs, and continuity of care. *See* **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); **Rosen v. Rosen**, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016).  

18. Relocation that significantly affects the child’s schedule or welfare qualifies as a material change in circumstances warranting modification. *See* **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); **Pappas v. Pappas**, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 140 (2008).  

19. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that custodial arrangements that interfere with a child’s sleep, schooling, or stability are contrary to the best interests of the child. *See* **Miller v. Miller**, 478 Mass. 642 (2018); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

20. The child’s need for adequate rest and a consistent school attendance routine falls squarely within the “best interests” framework under **G.L. c. 208 § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C § 20**, and the Court’s equitable powers under **G.L. c. 215 § 6**.

---

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

21. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court find a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior order and that continuing the midweek overnight is no longer in the best interests of the child.  

22. Plaintiff therefore requests that the Court **eliminate the Wednesday overnight parenting time** and adjust the parenting schedule to:  

   a. Provide reasonable non‑overnight midweek contact, such as a video or telephone call on Wednesdays; and  
   b. Maintain or, if necessary, extend the Defendant’s alternating weekend parenting time to compensate for the loss of the midweek overnight, consistent with the child’s best interests.  

23. The Plaintiff further requests any **other relief** the Court deems just and proper, including clarification or adjustment of transportation responsibilities to minimize disruption to the child’s schooling and sleep schedule.

---

### VII. WHEREFORE

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Laura Mitchell**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the Judgment of October 15, 2019;  
2. Find that continuation of the Wednesday overnight parenting time is **not in the child’s best interests**;  
3. **Modify the custody and parenting plan** to eliminate the Wednesday overnight and restructure the parenting schedule as set forth above; and  
4. Grant such **further relief** as justice and equity may require.
