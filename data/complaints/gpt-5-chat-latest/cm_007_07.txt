v.  

**MICHAEL CHESTER,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Chester,** pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody judgment entered on April 15, 2018, concerning the parties’ minor child, **Samantha Chester (DOB: [redacted])**, on the grounds that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child such that modification of the custody arrangement is in the child’s best interests.

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Laura Chester, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Phone: (617) 555‑0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Chester, also residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, **Samantha Chester**, age 12.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION**

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as this case concerns the modification of a custody order previously entered by this Court.

---

## **III. PRIOR COURT ORDER**

5. On **April 15, 2018**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody establishing **shared physical custody (50/50)** between Plaintiff and Defendant on a week‑on/week‑off schedule.  
6. At the time of the original judgment, both parents resided within close proximity and were in good health, and the child thrived in a routine that allowed for frequent and continuing contact with both parents.

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since entry of the 2018 custody judgment, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances that directly affects the welfare and best interests of Samantha Chester.  
8. Specifically, within the past year, **Michael Chester** has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that significantly impairs his physical mobility, coordination, and strength.  
9. Mr. Chester has experienced multiple falls in the home environment, requiring medical attention. His treating physician has advised that he **should not be left alone with the child in situations involving stairs, quick movement, or emergency response**, given the risk of injury to himself and the child.  
10. Despite these developments, Mr. Chester continues to insist on maintaining the original 50/50 physical custody schedule and has relied on the parties’ **twelve‑year‑old daughter** to assist in transferring him to bed or retrieving items, placing emotional and physical burdens on the child.  
11. This situation creates an environment in which Samantha is placed in a caretaking role inappropriate for her age and maturity, and it compromises her safety and emotional well‑being.  
12. Plaintiff acknowledges and supports Samantha’s continued relationship with her father but believes modification is necessary to adjust the schedule consistent with Mr. Chester’s current health and the child’s best interests.

## **V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

13. Under **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification serves the best interests of the child.  
14. The seminal cases **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), establish that the controlling standard is always the child’s best interests, with an emphasis on stability, safety, and continuity of care.  
15. The Court in **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), held that a judge must find both (a) a material change in circumstances since the prior judgment and (b) that modification serves the child’s best interest.  
16. The Supreme Judicial Court in **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981), confirmed that health and capacity of the parents are relevant to assessing changed circumstances.  
17. Similarly, **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), recognized that developments affecting a parent’s capacity to care for a child constitute sufficient grounds for modification.  
18. The Court in **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006), emphasized that the safety of the child and ability of the custodial parent to provide care are essential components of the best‑interest analysis.  
19. **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998), and **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), instruct that a child’s psychological and emotional welfare, including undue burden from caretaking roles, are relevant to custody determinations.  
20. **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986), and **Felton v. Felton**, 383 Mass. 232 (1981), further affirm that the Court maintains continuing jurisdiction to modify custody where changed circumstances so warrant.  
21. Pursuant to these authorities, the deterioration in Defendant’s health and resulting impact on the child’s safety and well-being constitute a clear material change in circumstances requiring modification.

## **VI. REQUESTED RELIEF**

**Wherefore**, Plaintiff, **Laura Chester**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the April 15, 2018 custody order;  
B. Determine that it is in the best interests of the minor child, **Samantha Chester**, that primary physical custody be awarded to Plaintiff;  
C. Award the Defendant reasonable parenting time and contact appropriate to his health condition and the child’s safety;  
D. Order such further modification of the parenting schedule as the Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the child;  
E. Grant any and all further relief the Court deems fair and equitable.
