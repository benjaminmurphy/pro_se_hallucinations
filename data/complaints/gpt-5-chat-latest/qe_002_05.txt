v.  
**Lily Anderson,**  
Defendant.  

Civil Action No.: __________

---

### **COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

---

#### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jordan Mitchell** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at **123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119**. Plaintiff is a tenant of the residential premises located at that address.

2. The Defendant, **Lily Anderson** (“Defendant”), is an individual doing business as landlord and owner of the above property located in Roxbury, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

#### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, which grants the Housing Court jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under or involving the rights or obligations of residential landlords and tenants.

4. Venue is proper in the **Boston Division of the Housing Court Department** because the rental property is located within its territorial jurisdiction.

---

#### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **March 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for rental of a basement apartment located at **123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119**, for a monthly rent of **$1,200**.

6. Plaintiff duly paid rent during the tenancy, though in **October 2025**, Plaintiff’s rent payment was delivered approximately two weeks late due to unforeseen medical expenses. Rent and any applicable late charges were fully paid in that month.

7. Beginning in **November 2025**, Plaintiff noticed **water seeping through the basement wall** of the apartment during heavy rainfall. The water intrusion caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, totaling approximately **$400** in value.

8. Plaintiff promptly **notified Defendant by text message** of the water intrusion and requested timely repairs. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but failed to undertake any repairs or remediation for several weeks.

9. When no remedial action was taken, Plaintiff contacted the **City of Boston Inspectional Services Department**, which inspected the premises and confirmed the presence of chronic moisture and other **housing code violations** in or around late November 2025.

10. Despite such findings, Defendant has not remedied the water infiltration problem as of the date of this filing, forcing Plaintiff to continuously run a dehumidifier to manage dampness, resulting in **increased electrical expenses**.

11. Since Plaintiff’s report to the city, Defendant has referred to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and informed Plaintiff that the lease would **not be renewed upon its expiration in March 2026**. Defendant cited Plaintiff’s brief late payment in October as the reason for nonrenewal, but the **timing and circumstances suggest retaliation** related to Plaintiff’s protected report to city authorities.

12. The continuing water intrusion and Defendant’s failure to repair constitute a **substantial interference with the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** of the leased premises, in violation of Massachusetts law.

#### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

13. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–12 as if fully stated herein.

14. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every residential lease and tenancy in Massachusetts carries an **implied covenant of quiet enjoyment**, which prohibits landlords from permitting interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. (*Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982)).

15. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition free from water infiltration constitutes a breach of this covenant. (*Hemming v. Lovering*, 448 Mass. 485 (2007); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)).

16. A landlord’s inaction or neglect that allows substantial interference with a tenant’s use of the premises can amount to a violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, even absent an intent to deprive the tenant of enjoyment. (*Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747 (2005)).

17. Defendant’s failure to timely repair a chronic water intrusion, despite notice, violated her duties under **G.L. c. 111, § 127A**, and the **State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. § 410.000 et seq.)**, which together require landlords to maintain rental units in a safe and sanitary condition. (*Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979)).

18. Defendant’s acts and omissions constitute an **unreasonable and substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. (*Blackett v. Olanoff*, supra; *Winchester v. Chan*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 696 (2016)).

19. Defendant’s conduct amounts to a **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment**, as recognized and enforced in **G.L. c. 186, § 14**. (*Simon v. Solomon*, supra; *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991)).

20. As a direct and foreseeable result, Plaintiff has suffered **property damage**, **increased utility costs**, and **emotional distress** associated with living in a persistently damp, unhealthy environment. (*Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Wideman*, 417 Mass. 771 (1994)).

21. Plaintiff’s cooperation with city inspectors and the Defendant’s subsequent threats of lease nonrenewal further illustrate retaliatory motive, supporting a finding of willful interference. (*Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)).

22. Accordingly, Defendant has unlawfully **interfered with the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** and is liable to Plaintiff pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which provides for actual and consequential damages, plus statutory minimums and costs.

#### **V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jordan Mitchell** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Lily Anderson** for **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment** under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
