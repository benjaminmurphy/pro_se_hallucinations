Thus, Simon v. Solomon does not stand as a holding that the landlord\u2019s failure to alleviate the water infiltration breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in a way that produced a sustained, independent covenant-based recovery. It primarily affirms liability for emotional distress and habitability, and treats quiet enjoyment through the statute rather than as a freestanding common-law covenant breach supporting that proposition.",

While this case is factually about heat and hot water rather than vermin, it makes clear that the Code (including its specific provisions such as 105 C.M.R. 410.550 on vermin) defines the minimum habitability obligations that landlords must maintain.

The justice actually criticizes the majority\u2019s broader warranty concept and urges tying the landlord\u2019s obligation strictly to statutory and code minimum standards, without framing that in terms of overlap with the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

There is nothing to suggest that our courts which have heretofore given relief to a tenant who is the victim of a \u2018constructive eviction\u2019 will not continue to do so in an appropriate case.
