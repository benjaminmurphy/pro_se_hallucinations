Thus, Al\u2011Ziab does not stand for the broad proposition that the defendant\u2019s conduct (here, simply violating the lead paint statute) is itself a breach of statutory and common\u2011law duties under Hemingway and related cases; instead it emphasizes the need to prove landlord fault for quiet enjoyment claims.",

Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

The court explicitly disclaims an intent or malice requirement and focuses on the landlord\u2019s conduct and control over the interfering conditions, which matches the proposition\u2019s description of substantial interference attributable to the landlord\u2019s acts or omissions sufficing for breach without malice or physical eviction.",
