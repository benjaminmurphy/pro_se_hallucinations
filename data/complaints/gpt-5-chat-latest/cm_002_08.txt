### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §28; G.L. c. 209C, §20; and related authorities)

---

**INTRODUCTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson** ("Plaintiff" or "Mother"), brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, §28** and related statutes, seeking a modification of an existing custody and parenting-time order issued by the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** on **May 15, 2021**, concerning the minor child, **Emma Johnson**, age 8.  

2. The Defendant, **Michael Johnson** ("Defendant" or "Father"), now intends to relocate his residence from the Cambridge, Massachusetts area to the State of New Hampshire for employment. This relocation constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that directly affects the welfare and best interests of the minor child.

3. A modification of the prior order is needed to ensure the child’s stability, minimize disruption to her schooling, safeguard her emotional well-being, and adapt the parenting schedule to the new geographic realities.

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. Jurisdiction is proper under **Mass. G.L. c. 208, §28** (as to divorces and custody modifications) and **G.L. c. 209C, §20** (as to custody determinations involving parents of minor children), as interpreted by *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

8. Venue lies in this Court because the original judgment was entered here, and both parties and the child have substantial connections to Middlesex County. See *G.L. c. 209C, §6*, and *Santos v. Santos*, 429 Mass. 490 (1999).  

---

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

9. The existing **Custody and Parenting Plan Order**, entered on **May 15, 2021**, grants the Mother primary physical custody and provides Father with parenting time every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.

10. At the time of the original order, both parties resided within a short distance of one another in the Cambridge area, and the schedule was premised on proximity to the child’s school and community.

11. In or about late 2025, the Defendant informed the Plaintiff that he intends to relocate to **New Hampshire** for employment, approximately **ninety minutes** away each direction from the child’s school in Cambridge.

12. The Father nonetheless requests to continue his current **Wednesday overnight** parenting time under the same terms, despite the substantial increase in travel distance.

13. This relocation creates **extended travel times** that would require the child to wake up very early and travel significant distances before school, causing fatigue, disruption to routines, interference with after-school activities, and emotional distress.

14. The child has expressed **anxiety** about the length of travel and missing social and extracurricular engagements, indicating detrimental effects on her **well-being** and **stability**.

15. The Plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to discuss adjustments to the schedule with the Defendant, but the parties have been unable to reach an agreement.

16. The Plaintiff seeks to **eliminate the midweek overnight** to protect the child’s welfare and to **adjust weekend time** in a manner that maintains meaningful parental contact while minimizing disruption.

---

### BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

17. Under **Mass. G.L. c. 208, §28**, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the last order, and that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests.  

18. The Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire constitutes a **material change of circumstances** that was **not contemplated** at the time of the 2021 judgment.  

19. See, e.g.:  
   - *Pierce v. Pierce*, 455 Mass. 286 (2009) (modification appropriate where circumstances materially change affecting child’s welfare).  
   - *Schutzbank v. Schutzbank*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 827 (2010) (long-distance relocation requiring modification).  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (relocation affecting child’s school schedule warrants reassessment of parenting time).  
   - *White v. LaBay*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 91 (2010) (child’s best interests are paramount in modification proceedings).  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (court must consider stability, child’s routines, and continuity).  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (judicial focus remains on child’s best interests, not parental convenience).  
   - *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (emphasizing child-centered criteria).  
   - *Middlesex County Probate & Family Court Standing Order 1-10* (requiring updated parenting schedules when relocation disrupts prior arrangements).  
   - *G.L. c. 208, §31* (defining shared custody and best-interest factors).  
   - *G.L. c. 208, §30* (removal statute, relevant by analogy to relocations across jurisdictions).  

20. The new distance and resulting commute constitute a **significant interference** with the child’s schooling and extracurricular life, satisfying the statutory standard for modification.  

21. The proposed modification minimizes travel strain and maintains regular, quality parenting time for both parents, consistent with *Rosenthal* and *Yannas*.

### REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2021 Custody Order;  

B. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting-time order to:  
   1. Eliminate the **midweek (Wednesday) overnight** with the Defendant due to travel and scheduling hardships;  
   2. Adjust the Defendant’s **weekend parenting time** to provide alternative visitation such as extended weekends, or such other schedule as the Court deems in the best interests of the child; and  
   3. Establish appropriate transportation and communication arrangements supportive of the child’s routines and emotional well-being;  

C. **Grant such further relief** as this Court considers just and proper to protect the child’s best interests.
