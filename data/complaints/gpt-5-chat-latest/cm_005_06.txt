# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and Related Authorities)**

---

### **I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Laura Johnson** (“Plaintiff”), resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The Defendant, **Mark Johnson** (“Defendant”), also resides within the jurisdiction of this Court or is otherwise subject to its personal jurisdiction.

2. This Complaint seeks a modification of a custody order issued by this Court on **June 15, 2021**, in connection with the parties’ original custody judgment concerning their minor children, **Emma Johnson (age 10)** and **Jake Johnson (age 8)**.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters of custody and visitation under **Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 208, §§ 28, 31**, and **c. 209C, § 20**, which authorize modification of custody and parenting orders when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and where modification serves the **best interests of the children**.

4. Venue is proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** pursuant to **G.L. c. 215, § 6**.

### **II. STATEMENT OF FACTS**

5. On **June 15, 2021**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time establishing **shared legal custody** of the minor children, with the children to **primarily reside with the Plaintiff** and maintain a structured visitation schedule with the Defendant.

6. The Judgment also required both parties to foster a positive relationship between the children and the other parent and to refrain from disparaging conduct or communication that would undermine the children’s relationship with either parent.

7. Over the past year, significant and material changes in circumstances have occurred that adversely affect the children’s welfare and undermine the functionality of the shared legal custody arrangement.

8. Specifically, the Defendant has routinely enrolled the children in extracurricular or recreational activities **during Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time** without prior consultation or agreement, in contravention of both the letter and spirit of the prior order.

9. The Defendant then tells the children that it is “their mother’s fault” if they cannot attend such activities while in her care, creating avoidable tension, guilt, and emotional conflict for the children.

10. The Plaintiff has learned through the children that the Defendant has made disparaging and emotionally harmful statements, including calling their mother “selfish” and alleging that she “does not really love them.”

11. As a result of these actions, the children—particularly the older child, **Emma**—have begun to experience physical symptoms (such as stomachaches) and anxiety on transition days between homes.

12. The children’s emotional well-being and stability are being compromised by the Defendant’s conduct, and the parental communication necessary for joint legal custody is effectively broken down.

13. These facts constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** warranting a modification of the existing custody and parenting order, as the current arrangement is no longer serving the children’s best interests.

---

### **III. LEGAL AUTHORITY**

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a custody and parenting judgment may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification would be in the children’s best interests.

15. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody determinations in Massachusetts. *Custody of Kali*, **439 Mass. 834, 845 (2003)**; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, **51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 265 (2001)**.

16. The Court must examine current circumstances, not merely conditions at the time of the original judgment. *Herb v. Herb*, **8 Mass. App. Ct. 419 (1979)**.

17. A breakdown in co-parenting communication or cooperation may constitute the requisite material change for modification. *Rolde v. Rolde*, **12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402 (1981)**; *Mason v. Coleman*, **447 Mass. 177, 183–184 (2006)**.

18. The Court gives primacy to the children’s welfare over parental convenience or preferences. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, **395 Mass. 704, 710–711 (1985)**.

19. Persistent disparagement or manipulation of the children’s perception of a parent can justify modification, as such behavior undermines the cooperative parenting required for shared legal custody. *Custody of Two Minors*, **396 Mass. 610 (1986)**; *Rolde*, **12 Mass. App. Ct. at 403**.

20. The emotional strain and psychosomatic symptoms experienced by the children, coupled with communication breakdown and disparagement, demonstrate that the existing shared legal custody is no longer viable or consistent with their best interests. *Custody of Vaughn*, **422 Mass. 590 (1996)**; *Adoption of Quentin*, **424 Mass. 882 (1997)**.

21. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that where one parent fails to communicate or acts in ways that undermine the other parent’s relationship with the children, shared legal custody should not continue. *Smith v. McDonald*, **458 Mass. 540 (2010)**; *Schechter v. Schechter*, **88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**.

22. The authority of the Court to revise custody orders to reflect the children’s best interests is further supported by **G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 208, § 1A; G.L. c. 215, § 6**, and related case law.

### **IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

23. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the June 15, 2021 order be **modified** to reflect the following:

   a. That the Plaintiff, **Laura Johnson**, shall have **sole legal and physical custody** of the minor children, subject to reasonable parenting time for the Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, as the Court deems appropriate and consistent with the children’s needs and emotional welfare;

   b. That the Defendant’s parenting time schedule be modified to a consistent and predictable arrangement that minimizes disruption and fosters stability;

   c. That both parties be specifically prohibited from enrolling the children in extracurricular or other scheduled activities that fall on the other parent’s parenting time without written consent from the other parent or prior Court approval;

   d. That both parties reaffirm their obligation not to disparage or undermine the other parent in the children’s presence and to support the children’s relationship with both parents;

   e. That such other and further relief be granted as justice and equity require under **G.L. c. 215, § 6** and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60(b)**.

---

### **V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Laura Johnson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the June 15, 2021 custody order;

2. Modify said custody order in accordance with the proposed changes listed above;

3. Enter such further orders as are necessary to serve the **best interests of the minor children, Emma and Jake Johnson**;

4. Grant such other relief as may be equitable and proper.
