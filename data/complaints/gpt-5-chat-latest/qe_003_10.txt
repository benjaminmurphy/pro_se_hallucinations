v.

Defendant.  

Civil Action No. ___________

### **COMPLAINT**  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

### **INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff Maya Thompson (“Plaintiff”), a residential tenant, brings this action against Defendant Richard Greene (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, arising from Defendant’s failure to maintain the leased premises in a habitable condition and his interference with Plaintiff’s beneficial use and enjoyment of her apartment by failing to repair a recurring roof leak that caused damage to her personal property and created unsafe living conditions.

---

### **PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Maya Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment Studio, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  
2. Defendant Richard Greene is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the property at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (“the Premises”).  

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 since the amount in controversy is under $25,000 and the property that is the subject of this action lies within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division.  
4. Venue is proper under G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the premises are located in Jamaica Plain, which falls within this judicial district.

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about February 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease for the Premises with Defendant for a monthly rent of $1,500.  
6. Prior to execution of the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling and specifically inquired about them.  
7. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were the result of an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”  
8. Plaintiff relied upon Defendant’s assurances in deciding to rent the Premises.  
9. In or around March 2022, during the first major rainstorm after Plaintiff’s tenancy began, water began leaking through the same ceiling area where stains were visible.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak.  
11. Defendant failed and refused to make necessary repairs, repeatedly dismissing the problem as “minor” and “cosmetic.”  
12. Over the next several months, the leak continued to worsen.  
13. In one instance, water dripped onto Plaintiff’s couch and coffee table, soaking her laptop, which was rendered inoperable and required replacement at a cost of approximately $900.  
14. The ongoing water intrusion has caused persistent dampness, a musty odor, and apparent mold growth in Plaintiff’s unit.  
15. Plaintiff has suffered headaches and discomfort that she reasonably attributes to the mold or mildew conditions.  
16. Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed and belongings to one side of the apartment to avoid the leaking area, thereby losing the full use and enjoyment of her home.  
17. Defendant has continued to collect full rent each month despite notice of the conditions and their impact on Plaintiff’s use of the Premises.  
18. Defendant has made no meaningful efforts to fix the roof or ceiling leak, to remove mold, or to restore the apartment to a habitable condition.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 18 above as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease and tenancy in Massachusetts includes a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing that the tenant shall not be disturbed in her possession and use of the premises by the landlord or by acts under his control.  
21. Defendant, by failing to repair the defective roof and allowing water to leak into the apartment, has violated Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  
22. The leak and resulting mold have rendered Plaintiff’s apartment unfit for human habitation and substantially interfered with her ability to use and enjoy her home.  
23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a “serious interference” with Plaintiff’s tenancy as defined by Massachusetts case law. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
24. Defendant had actual and repeated notice of the leak and failed to act with due diligence to remedy the condition, thereby breaching his statutory covenant. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Winthrop Realty Co. v. Menin*, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 52 (2003).  
25. Defendant’s inaction constitutes a constructive eviction and/or a breach of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts precedent. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC*, 478 Mass. 697 (2018).  
26. Defendant’s conduct also violates the implied warranty of habitability codified and recognized through *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), which informs the interpretation of quiet enjoyment obligations.  
27. The persistent leak and resulting damage substantially impaired the character and value of the Premises, and thereby violated G.L. c. 239, § 8A, which protects tenants from retaliatory or neglectful actions when enforcing their housing rights.  
28. Defendant’s disregard for habitability obligations is further evidenced by violation of State Sanitary Code standards, specifically 105 C.M.R. § 410.500 (requiring landlords to maintain watertight roofing).  
29. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered property loss, emotional distress, physical discomfort, and loss of use of the premises.  
30. Plaintiff has incurred damages in the amount of at least $900 for property loss and seeks all statutory damages available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including treble damages, attorney’s fees, and costs. See *Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.*, 439 Mass. 512 (2003).
