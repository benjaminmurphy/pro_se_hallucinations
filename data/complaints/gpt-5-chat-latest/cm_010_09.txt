v.

Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

### INTRODUCTION

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson** (“Mother”), and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, **c. 215, § 6**, and the inherent jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court, to **modify the existing custody and parenting time order** entered on **May 15, 2016**, on the grounds that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child, **Sophie Johnson**, age ten.  

---

### PARTIES

1.  The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the biological mother of Sophie Johnson, age ten (DOB: [withheld]). Her contact information is: (617) 555‑0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2.  The Defendant, Michael Johnson, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the biological father of Sophie Johnson.  
3.  The minor child, Sophie Johnson, presently resides primarily with the Defendant pursuant to the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan issued by this Court on **May 15, 2016**.

---

### BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER

4.  The Judgment of May 15, 2016 granted to the Defendant, Michael Johnson, *primary physical custody* of the parties’ minor child, with the Plaintiff having limited parenting time consisting of alternating weekend visits and one mid‑week dinner.  
5.  At the time of entry of the prior Judgment, the Plaintiff was a graduate student living in a small studio apartment, with limited financial and housing stability and a demanding academic schedule.  
6.  The prior custody arrangement reflected the circumstances then existing and served the best interests of the child at that time.

---

### MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7.  Since entry of the prior Judgment, the circumstances of the Plaintiff and the minor child have **substantially and materially changed**.  
8.  The Plaintiff has successfully completed her graduate degree and is now employed full‑time in a stable position with regular work hours.  
9.  The Plaintiff resides in a two‑bedroom apartment, and the child has her own bedroom there, providing a comfortable and appropriate living environment.  
10. The child, now ten years old, has developed strong emotional bonds with both parents and has expressed to her therapist and to the Court (in a letter) her desire for additional overnight time and a more balanced schedule between homes.  
11. According to the child’s therapist, the existing schedule causes the child feelings of guilt and distress when visits with her mother end abruptly after short intervals.  
12. The Defendant has refused to discuss or negotiate any modification of the custody or parenting plan and responds angrily when the child attempts to raise the subject.  
13. The Plaintiff’s life circumstances have stabilized and improved significantly, enabling her to provide consistent care, structure, and emotional support to the child.  
14. These developments constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** as contemplated under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and the best interests of the child warrant modification of the existing judgment.

### APPLICABLE LAW AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITIES  

15.  Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody judgment “upon a showing that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  
16.  See also **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20** (permitting modification of custody and parenting orders where circumstances change).  
17.  Massachusetts case law establishes that stability of the custodial arrangement must yield to the paramount interest of the child’s welfare. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  
18.  A change in a parent’s living situation, employment stability, or ability to provide care may satisfy the threshold of a “material change.” *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
19.  The Court must assess the totality of the circumstances affecting the child’s wellbeing. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
20.  When the custodial arrangement no longer serves the child’s welfare, modification is appropriate. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
21.  The child’s age‑related developmental needs and preferences are among the factors considered in determining best interests. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  
22.  A parent’s improved stability and capacity to nurture constitutes a significant change justifying modification. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
23.  The Court’s primary focus is always the *best interests of the child*. *Custody of a Minor (No. 1)*, 377 Mass. 876 (1979).  
24.  The child’s expressed wishes may be considered where the child is of sufficient maturity. *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  
25.  In balancing continuity against changed circumstances, the Court may determine that shared or expanded parenting time better serves emotional wellbeing. *Miller v. Miller*, 478 Mass. 642 (2018).

### REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1.  Determine that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the Judgment of May 15, 2016.  
2.  Modify the existing custody and parenting order to grant the Plaintiff **expanded parenting time**, including additional overnights and weekends, so that the child may spend substantially more time with her mother in accordance with the child’s best interests.  
3.  Order such additional provisions as the Court deems proper to ensure the continued emotional and physical wellbeing of the minor child.  
4.  Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
