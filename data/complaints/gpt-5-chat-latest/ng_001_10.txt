### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation with a principal place of business at 123 Main Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143, and conducts business as a retail grocery store open to the general public.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper under **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 and the matter arises in Middlesex County.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, because the Defendant’s principal place of business is within Middlesex County and the alleged negligent acts and resulting injuries occurred therein.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 16, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and business invitee at Defendant’s grocery store located at **123 Main Street, Somerville, MA 02143**.  
6. While walking through the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk.  
7. The puddle was large enough to be visible and had evident cart tracks, indicating it had been present for a period sufficient to be discovered and remedied by Defendant’s employees.  
8. No warning cones, “wet floor” signs, or other hazard markers were placed to alert customers of the spill.  
9. A store employee stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away stated to Plaintiff, immediately after her fall, that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing another task before mopping it up.  
10. Plaintiff fell heavily, injuring her right hip.  
11. Later that evening, Plaintiff experienced significant pain and sought medical treatment the following day at an urgent care clinic, where she was diagnosed with a **hip sprain**, resulting in physical therapy and restricted activity.  
12. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses and approximately **$800** in lost wages from missed work as a barista at a local café.  
13. Defendant, through its employees, agents, and servants, owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a safe condition, free from unreasonably dangerous conditions such as wet or slippery floors.  
14. Defendant breached that duty by failing to promptly clean up the spill, failing to post adequate warnings, and otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injury to customers.  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, pain and suffering, lost income, and other damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes invitees the duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any foreseeable hazards. **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**.  
18. The Defendant’s failure to remedy or warn of the milk spill constitutes a breach of that duty.  
19. Massachusetts courts have long held that a storekeeper may be liable when an injury results from a condition that the owner or its employees knew or should have known about through the exercise of reasonable care. **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165 (1973)**; **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263 (1961)**.  
20. The constructive knowledge standard imposes liability where the dangerous condition existed long enough that it should have been discovered by reasonable inspection. **Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., 208 Mass. 273 (1911)**; **Gallagher v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 332 Mass. 560 (1955)**.  
21. The law recognizes that failure to warn of or correct a known slippery surface is negligence. **Thompson v. Lily’s Supermarket, Inc., 341 Mass. 681 (1961)**; **Correira v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 388 Mass. 1007 (1983)**.  
22. Defendant’s employee’s admission that he had already noticed the spill but delayed cleanup demonstrates actual notice and failure to act reasonably under the circumstances. Actual notice is sufficient for liability. **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**.  
23. Plaintiff’s status as a paying customer confers invitee protections and entitles her to the exercise of ordinary care in maintaining safe conditions. **Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244 (1982)**; **Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206 (1978)**.  
24. Defendant’s omissions directly caused Plaintiff’s hip injury. Proximate causation under Massachusetts negligence law requires that the defendant’s conduct be a substantial contributing factor in bringing about the harm suffered. **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)**.  
25. Plaintiff’s harm was foreseeable given the obvious risk posed by a slick spill on a tiled grocery floor, particularly when the employee had actual knowledge of the hazard.  
26. Defendant’s conduct therefore constitutes negligence under Massachusetts common and statutory law, including **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence) and relevant premises liability principles.

### V. DAMAGES

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained:  
   a. Physical injury, pain, and suffering;  
   b. Emotional distress;  
   c. Medical expenses of approximately **$1,200**;  
   d. Lost wages and diminished earning capacity totaling approximately **$800**; and  
   e. Additional general and special damages to be proven at trial.  
28. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this complaint to conform to evidence at trial.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for negligence;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount reasonably commensurate with Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and expenses, including but not limited to not less than **$25,000**, exclusive of interest and costs;  
C. Award statutory pre-judgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C**;  
D. Award costs of this action; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38(b)**.
