*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, §14)*

---

#### I. PARTIES AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Maria Lopez (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301. Plaintiff has been a tenant of the premises since June 1, 2022, pursuant to a residential lease agreement with Defendant.  

2. Defendant John Harrison (“Defendant”) is an individual and the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  

3. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §2 because the real property that is the subject of this action is located in Plymouth County, and Defendant conducts business there.  

4. Jurisdiction is proper under G.L. c. 185C, §3 and the general jurisdiction of the District Court for actions concerning residential tenancies and claims under G.L. c. 186, §14.

#### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff became a lawful tenant of Defendant at 123 Maple Street, paying monthly rent of $1,200.  

6. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment ceased functioning.  

7. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant that same day of the lack of hot water.  

8. Defendant responded that the water heater required a replacement part and that the part had been ordered.  

9. As of the date of filing—December 1, 2025—approximately three weeks have passed without restoration of hot water to the apartment.  

10. Plaintiff has repeatedly communicated with Defendant, who has continued to state that the repair is delayed due to supplier issues.  

11. During the period without hot water, the premises have been unfit for ordinary use as a dwelling, forcing Plaintiff to take showers at a gym at personal expense and to use alternate means to bathe her infant child.  

12. Plaintiff incurred additional costs, including gym membership fees of approximately $30 and travel expenses, and has experienced discomfort and disruption of normal living conditions as a direct result of the continued deprivation of hot water.  

13. Defendant has not provided any abatement of rent, alternate accommodations, or other compensation.  

14. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water for more than three weeks constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, in violation of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  

---

#### III. LEGAL BASIS  

15. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises by the tenant.  

16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy in Massachusetts. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

17. The failure to provide essential services such as heat or hot water constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300 (1999); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  

18. Massachusetts law recognizes that a landlord’s inaction or delay in remedying conditions that materially impair the tenant’s use of the premises can constitute interference “by omission” under G.L. c. 186, §14. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  

19. The implied covenant ensures tenants the right to occupy premises suitable for human habitation. *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  

20. The provision of hot water is a minimum standard of habitability required under G.L. c. 111, §127A and the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190, which mandates that landlords supply hot water of at least 110°F.  

21. Defendant’s failure to comply with this obligation resulted in a continuing, substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to live peaceably in her apartment. *Fletcher v. Chamberlin*, 171 Mass. 135 (1898); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman*, 417 Mass. 771 (1994).  

22. Even where a landlord’s failure arises from negligence or circumstances allegedly beyond the landlord’s control, liability under G.L. c. 186, §14 remains strict. *Simon v. Solomon*, supra; *Blackett v. Olanoff*, supra.  

23. Plaintiff did not waive her rights under the lease or statute and at all times remained current on rent payments.  

24. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and entitle Plaintiff to actual and statutory damages.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**  

25. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  

26. Defendant has, through his failure to provide essential hot water service for an extended period, substantially and unlawfully interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  

27. Defendant’s conduct violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied by law and codified in G.L. c. 186, §14.  

28. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered economic loss, inconvenience, and interference with the use of her dwelling.  

29. Plaintiff has sustained damages in the amount of approximately $450, representing rent abatement and incidental costs necessitated by the lack of hot water.  

30. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of this action.

C. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs of this action;
