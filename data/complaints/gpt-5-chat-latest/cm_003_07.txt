**Filed:** December 1, 2025

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Emily Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555‑0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Smith, believed to reside in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
3. The minor child subject to this action is **Liam Smith**, age 9.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, §28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §20**, and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60(b)**.  
5. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court**, which issued the existing custody order dated **September 15, 2021**.

---

### III. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER

6. On or about September 15, 2021, the Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan** awarding the parties **shared legal custody** of Liam, with his **primary physical residence** with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson.  
7. Under that order, the Defendant, Michael Smith, was entitled to **weekend parenting time**, generally consisting of alternating weekends and occasional holidays.  
8. The Court based its prior determination on findings that both parents were stable and could co‑parent cooperatively in Liam’s best interests.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2021 order, substantial and material changes have arisen affecting Liam’s safety, welfare, and best interests, as defined under **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) and **Miller v. Miller**, 478 Mass. 642 (2018).  
10. During 2025, Liam reported to the Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that Defendant sometimes “can’t walk straight.”  
11. A neighbor who is personally acquainted with both parties provided the Plaintiff with a video recording depicting Defendant stumbling while retrieving Liam from a vehicle late at night.  
12. Liam’s school has notified the Plaintiff that he frequently appears **fatigued and unprepared** on Monday mornings following weekends spent with Defendant.  
13. These incidents raise serious concerns about Defendant’s **alcohol use and capacity to provide a safe, stable environment** for the minor child.  
14. Such changes constitute a *material and substantial change of circumstances* under **G.L. c. 208, §28**, warranting modification of the prior custody arrangement. See also:  
   - **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (material change analysis);  
   - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (standard for modification);  
   - **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976) (paramount concern: child’s welfare);  
   - **Care & Protection of Zita**, 455 Mass. 272 (2009) (court’s duty to protect);  
   - **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (change must affect best interests);  
   - **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests balancing);  
   - **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (custody evaluated by current welfare);  
   - **Spinney v. Hill**, 462 Mass. 1001 (2012) (court’s continuing jurisdiction);  
   - **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (child protection); and  
   - **Care & Protection of Emily**, 513 Mass. 109 (2023) (parental fitness and safety).

15. The child’s emotional and physical well‑being are now *adversely affected* by the present schedule, constituting precisely the circumstances under which modification is appropriate.  
16. Continuation of the existing unsupervised overnight parenting time creates a risk of harm contrary to Liam’s best interests.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the September 15, 2021 custody order;  
B. Determine that modification of that order is **necessary and proper in the best interests** of the minor child under **G.L. c. 208, §28**;  
C. Modify the existing custody and parenting order to require that:

   1. The Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised**, pending further review, or that specific conditions be imposed (such as proof of sobriety, completion of a substance‑abuse evaluation, or limitation of overnights);  
   2. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, shall retain **primary physical custody** and continue to make day‑to‑day decisions for Liam;  
   3. Both parents shall continue to share legal custody only insofar as Defendant’s exercise of such custody does not impair child safety; and  
   4. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper be granted.
