### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff, **Laura Matthews**, respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on **May 15, 2021**, regarding the minor children **Emily Parker (born 2017)** and **Jacob Parker (born 2019)**. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the existing custody and parenting schedule due to a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children.  

---

**II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Laura Matthews, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children.  
   - Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   - Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Daniel Parker, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor children.

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the original decree was entered in this Court and the minor children reside within Bristol County. See also *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  

4. Venue is proper in the **Bristol Probate and Family Court**, where the original custody order was issued and both parties reside.  

---

**IV. PRIOR ORDER**

5. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court entered a Judgment establishing joint legal custody of the minor children, with primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and parenting time to the Defendant as follows: every other weekend and one overnight during the week.  

---

**V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. Since the entry of the May 15, 2021 order, the Defendant has undergone a substantial and material change in his employment schedule and ability to exercise overnight parenting time.  

7. Specifically, in 2025 the Defendant accepted a new position that requires him to work **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** several nights per week, often including the evenings when his overnight parenting time was scheduled.  

8. As a result, the Defendant frequently cancels or cuts short scheduled visits, drops the children off at the Plaintiff’s residence without adequate notice, or leaves the children with third parties (including a roommate not known to Plaintiff), contrary to the spirit and purpose of the prior order and the best interests of the children.  

9. The children, ages 8 and 6, have reported that when in the Defendant’s care after his overnight shifts, they often fall asleep unsupervised while their father is resting, and that meals and school routines are disrupted.

10. These circumstances materially affect the children’s stability, safety, and routines, and constitute a substantial change warranting modification pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, and as interpreted by *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), which holds that a parent seeking to modify custody must demonstrate a material and substantial change and that modification is in the best interests of the children.  

---

**VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN**

11. Massachusetts law requires that parenting schedules serve the **best interests of the children** (*Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)).  

12. The Defendant’s current work schedule prevents him from providing overnight care consistent with the children’s health, safety, and welfare.  

13. The Plaintiff has continuously provided a stable and consistent home, facilitating school attendance, extracurricular activities, and maintaining the children’s regular routines.  

14. Modification to restrict overnight parenting time to nights when the Defendant is off work aligns with the guiding principles of *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (parenting plans must adapt to changed circumstances to protect the child’s best interests), and *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000) (court must balance parental rights against the paramount concern for the child’s wellbeing).  

---

**VII. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES**

15. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify custody and parenting orders upon a showing of a "material and substantial change of circumstances" and when modification serves the children's best interests.  

16. Additional relevant Massachusetts authorities include:  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) — material and substantial change standard.  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) — custody determined by child’s best interests, considering family stability.  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) — paramount concern is best interests of children.  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) — modification requires showing of changed circumstances since prior order.  
   - *Verts v. Verts*, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 81 (2003) — courts may modify parenting schedule to prevent instability caused by parental unavailability.  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) — joint custody viable only when both parents can cooperate in providing care.  
   - *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) — material change justified modification where prior schedule became impracticable.  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) — modification appropriate to align with children’s developmental needs.  
   - *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981) — a shift in parental availability supports change in custody or visitation schedule.  
   - *G.L. c. 209C, § 20* — authorizes modification of custody orders regarding minor children of unmarried parents (if applicable).  
   - *G.L. c. 215, § 6* — grants the Probate and Family Court equitable jurisdiction over child custody matters.

**VIII. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Laura Matthews**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Determine that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the May 15, 2021 custody order;  
2. Modify the Final Custody and Parenting Order to provide that the Defendant’s **overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when he is not scheduled to work** and is personally available to supervise the children;  
3. Order that any exchange or adjustment of parenting time be arranged with advance notice between the parties;  
4. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the children.
