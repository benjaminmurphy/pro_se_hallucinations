### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Alex Rivera** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130, who rents and occupies a residential studio apartment pursuant to a written lease agreement with Defendant.  
2. Defendant **Jordan Morgan** (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the property located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was responsible for maintaining the premises in a habitable condition in accordance with Massachusetts law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19**, and **G.L. c. 185C, §3**, as the action arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and the premises are located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Jamaica Plain Division, because the property that is the subject of this action is located in Jamaica Plain and Defendant’s obligations as landlord arose there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **February 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the studio apartment located at **45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130**, for a monthly rent of **$1,500**.  
6. During the initial showing of the apartment, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling and specifically asked Defendant about them. Defendant represented that the stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”  
7. Shortly after moving in, during the first major rainstorm, water began to drip through the same area of the ceiling where the prior stains were located.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem. Defendant dismissed the complaint, characterizing it as a “minor cosmetic issue” and asserting that the apartment’s condition merely reflected its “character.”  
9. Despite repeated notifications from Plaintiff over the ensuing months, Defendant failed and refused to make adequate repairs.  
10. The water intrusion has become progressively worse, including during one storm when the leak soaked Plaintiff’s couch and caused water damage to Plaintiff’s laptop computer, valued at approximately **$900**.  
11. The continuing moisture has produced a persistent musty odor in the apartment, suggestive of mold growth.  
12. Plaintiff has experienced recurring headaches and other symptoms believed to be related to the environmental conditions resulting from unchecked water intrusion.  
13. Plaintiff has been forced to rearrange the apartment, move the bed away from the affected area, and effectively live in only half the available space.  
14. Defendant’s failure to correct the condition has substantially interfered with and diminished Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  
15. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent in good faith throughout this period, though the premises have not been maintained in a safe, habitable, or reasonably comfortable condition as required by law.  
16. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the statutory and common-law **covenant of quiet enjoyment** implied in every residential tenancy.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 16 above.  
18. Pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.”  
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees the tenant’s right to freedom from serious interferences that impair the character or value of the leased premises. See **Simon v. Solomon**, **385 Mass. 91 (1982)**; **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, **417 Mass. 273 (1994)**.  
20. Defendant’s repeated failure to repair the leaking ceiling constitutes an act of **constructive eviction and interference with the quiet enjoyment** of the premises. See **Gabay v. O’Brien**, **57 Mass. App. Ct. 561 (2003)**.  
21. A landlord’s failure to remedy substantial leaks and environmental hazards after notice constitutes an interference within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14. See **Coveney v. Coughlin**, **382 Mass. 409 (1981)**; **Blackett v. Olanoff**, **371 Mass. 714 (1977)**.  
22. Massachusetts courts have held that persistent leaks, mold, or other water-related defects materially interfere with a tenant’s beneficial use. See **Lowery v. Robinson**, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**.  
23. Defendant’s conduct violates **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, which allows tenants to assert defenses and counterclaims when a landlord fails to maintain habitable premises.  
24. Defendant also failed to comply with the **Massachusetts State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. §§410.000 et seq.**, which requires landlords to maintain watertight roofs, ceilings, and walls.  
25. A landlord’s neglect of maintenance and repair duties that results in substantial water penetration and mold contamination constitutes a per se violation of the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment. See **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, **363 Mass. 184 (1973)**; **Al‐Ziab v. Mourgis**, **424 Mass. 847 (1997)**.  
26. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment was **willful** and **intentional** within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14, because Defendant knew of the leaks and failed to take reasonable steps to address them.  
27. As a result of Defendant’s unlawful interference, Plaintiff has suffered **property damage ($900 for a ruined laptop)**, **loss of use** of part of the premises, and **physical discomfort and distress**.  
28. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees**.

C. Award Plaintiff **costs of suit and statutory attorney’s fees** under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, notwithstanding Plaintiff’s pro se status;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
