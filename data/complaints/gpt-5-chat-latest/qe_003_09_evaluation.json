The court affirms liability and attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 14 based on Gem\u2019s failure to prevent repeated flooding, explicitly tying that failure to maintain habitable conditions to interference with quiet enjoyment.

The court lists various sanitary code violations and upholds a damages award for breach of the warranty of habitability, but it neither analyzes nor holds that these conditions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
