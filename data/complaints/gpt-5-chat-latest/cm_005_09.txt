Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Robinson** (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), respectfully files this **Complaint for Modification** pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28** and the inherent equitable powers of the Probate and Family Court.  

2. The parties were previously before this Court, and on **May 15, 2022**, the **Norfolk Probate and Family Court** issued a custody judgment providing for **shared legal custody** of the parties’ minor children, **Liam Robinson (born 2015)** and **Ava Robinson (born 2017)**, with the children’s **primary physical residence with Mother**, and the **Father, David Robinson**, to have parenting time every other weekend, along with such other terms as were contained in the judgment.  

3. This Court has **continuing jurisdiction** under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6** to modify custody and parenting orders where a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the prior judgment, and such modification would serve the **best interests of the children**.  

---

**II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. Since the custody order entered on May 15, 2022, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** materially affecting the welfare of the children.  

5. Over the past year, the Defendant, **David Robinson**, has repeatedly scheduled the children for extracurricular activities that conflict with Mother’s court-ordered custodial time without prior discussion or mutual agreement.  

6. When Mother has expressed concerns or attempted to coordinate scheduling adjustments, Father has told the children that Mother “doesn’t really love them” or that she is being “selfish” for not agreeing to every schedule change.  

7. The children have directly reported these comments to Mother, and one child, Liam, has begun experiencing **stomach aches and anxiety** surrounding transitions to Father’s care.  

8. Father’s conduct has caused increasing distress to both children and has undermined the parties’ ability to share joint legal custody effectively.  

9. The derogatory comments and one-sided decision-making violate the spirit and letter of the existing order, which requires the parents to foster the children’s relationship with both parents and to refrain from disparaging one another in the children’s presence.  

10. Despite Mother’s repeated efforts to resolve these issues cooperatively, Father has continued to act unilaterally regarding significant parental decisions, including scheduling, extracurricular involvement, and the children’s emotional needs.  

11. As a result of these ongoing actions, **the shared legal custody arrangement is no longer workable or in the best interests of the children.**

---

**III. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

12. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody judgment upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and where modification is **in the best interests of the child**.  

13. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a material change may be found where communication between parents has broken down to the detriment of the children, or one parent’s behavior undermines the coparenting relationship.  
    - *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
    - *Hale v. Hale*, 394 Mass. 746 (1985);  
    - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

14. The paramount consideration in all custody determinations is the **best interests of the children**. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).  

15. The breakdown of communication and the persistent disparagement by a parent of the other parent to the children constitutes a material change in circumstances. *See* **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

16. A modification from shared legal custody to sole legal custody is appropriate when joint decision-making is no longer feasible due to lack of cooperation or communication. *See* **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Miller v. Todd*, 2017 Mass. App. Unpub. LEXIS 734.  

17. The Court also has authority to clarify parenting schedule terms and conditions to promote the children’s welfare. *See* **Ireland v. Ireland**, 433 Mass. 479 (2001); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).  

18. Taken together, these authorities support modification when co-parent conflict impacts children’s emotional health and stability, as appears here.

**IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Emily Robinson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. **Modify** the custody judgment entered on May 15, 2022, granting **sole legal custody** of the minor children, **Liam Robinson** and **Ava Robinson**, to **Emily Robinson**;  

2. **Maintain** the children’s **primary physical residence** with Mother, with an appropriate and regular schedule of parenting time for Father, as may serve the children’s best interests;  

3. **Clarify and modify** the existing parenting plan to include provisions requiring mutual agreement before enrolling the children in activities or making schedule changes that affect the other parent’s custodial time;  

4. **Include language expressly prohibiting** disparagement of either parent before the children;  

5. **Grant such further relief** as the Court deems just and proper.
