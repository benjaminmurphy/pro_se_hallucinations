### **COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint against Defendant, Sarah Thompson (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Apartment [Unit number if any], Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.
2. Defendant Sarah Thompson is an individual and the owner and landlord of the premises located at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, which she rents to the Plaintiff under a written tenancy agreement.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 3**, and **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, because the property that is the subject of this complaint is located in Lowell, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of the Lowell District Court.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff has been a lawful residential tenant of the Defendant at 45 Maple Street since **February 1, 2022**, paying monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. In or around the spring of **2025**, Plaintiff observed mold growth forming in the corner of the shower, which eventually spread across the bathroom ceiling.  
7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant inspected the premises but asserted that the mold was caused by Plaintiff taking “too long and too hot” showers and not running the exhaust fan sufficiently.  
8. Plaintiff regularly operates the bathroom fan during showers, and the bathroom lacks any window for natural ventilation.  
9. The mold has persisted despite Plaintiff’s reasonable efforts to clean the affected area. Defendant has refused to undertake proper remediation or address the inadequate ventilation that allows the condition to continue.  
10. As a result of the persistent mold, Plaintiff has suffered **respiratory symptoms** including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, and incurred property losses of approximately **$60** due to mold damage to towels and a shower curtain.  
11. Plaintiff’s physician has advised that exposure to the mold likely contributed to her respiratory symptoms and recommended remediation of the affected areas.  
12. Defendant’s failure to remedy the conditions has rendered the premises **unfit for human habitation** and has **substantially interfered with the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** of her rental premises.  
13. Despite notice and a reasonable opportunity to correct the problem, Defendant has failed and refused to properly remediate the condition.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Massachusetts law implies in every residential lease a covenant of quiet enjoyment, whereby a landlord shall not interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. **G.L. c. 186, § 14.**  
16. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition, specifically her failure to remediate serious mold growth and address inadequate ventilation, constitutes a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
17. Defendant’s conduct violates **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
18. Defendant’s actions also violate **G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L**, and the **State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.)**, which require that dwellings be maintained free from chronic dampness and mold growth.  
19. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of her statutory and common-law duties under **Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); **Hemingway v. Tufts**, 361 Mass. 183 (1972); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); and **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
20. Under **Simon v. Solomon**, supra, and **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), substantial interference with the tenant’s enjoyment of the premises, attributable to the landlord’s acts or omissions, constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment even in the absence of malice or direct physical eviction.  
21. Defendant’s failure to address mold and unfit living conditions constitutes an **indirect act of interference** comparable to the constructive eviction recognized in **Jerome v. Commonwealth**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 933 (1987).  
22. The continuing failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition also violates **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980)**, which holds landlords responsible for conditions that pose unreasonable risks to tenants**.  
23. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is further protected by **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, which affords tenants a defense and counterclaim for violations of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, the **State Sanitary Code**, or related laws.  
24. Defendant’s failure to take proper corrective action is willful and knowing, or at minimum reckless, and therefore entitles Plaintiff to **statutory damages of not less than one month’s rent or actual damages, whichever is greater**, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

---

### **V. DAMAGES**

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has:  
   a. Suffered respiratory and health issues;  
   b. Lost personal property worth approximately **$60**;  
   c. Endured distress, discomfort, and loss of use and enjoyment of her apartment; and  
   d. Sustained other consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial.  

26. Plaintiff estimates that her total damages, including statutory relief, amount to **approximately $200**, but reserves the right to amend this demand as evidence may show.

---

### **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment** under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **damages of not less than one month’s rent ($1,200)** or actual damages, whichever is greater, pursuant to statute;  
C. Award Plaintiff compensation for lost property, inconvenience, and emotional distress;  
D. Award costs of suit and statutory attorney’s fees (if applicable); and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### **VII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
