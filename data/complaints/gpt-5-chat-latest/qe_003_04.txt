### **COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Monroe** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555‑0123 or by email at *psm1433@gmail.com*.

2. Defendant **Samuel Larkin** (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (“the Premises”).

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §3, which grants the Housing Court jurisdiction over civil actions arising out of the landlord‑tenant relationship.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises commencing on or about **January 15, 2023**, for a monthly rent of **$1,450** payable to Defendant.

6. Prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed visible water stains on the ceiling of the unit. Upon inquiry, Defendant represented that the stains were the result of an old leak that had been completely repaired.

7. Shortly after Plaintiff’s occupancy began, during the first significant rainfall, water began to drip from the same section of ceiling previously showing stains.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak and requested repairs. Despite repeated notices, Defendant failed and refused to repair the defect in a timely or adequate manner.

9. Defendant minimized the problem, characterizing it as a “minor cosmetic issue” and stating that Plaintiff “knew the apartment had character” when agreeing to the tenancy.

10. The leak has persisted and worsened over multiple rainstorms. The moisture caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including her couch and a laptop computer valued at approximately **$900**, which was destroyed by water intrusion.

11. The leak and resulting dampness have created a **musty odor**, visible discoloration, and conditions conducive to mold growth. Plaintiff has experienced physical symptoms such as headaches that she reasonably believes are caused by the unhealthy conditions in the dwelling.

12. Due to continuing water intrusion and associated odors, Plaintiff is unable to use the full space of her apartment and has been forced to move her bed and furniture away from the affected area.

13. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a habitable and watertight condition, despite notice, materially interferes with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of her tenancy and constitutes a violation of Massachusetts law.

14. Plaintiff has at all times remained current in rent payments and has complied with her obligations as a tenant.

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages including: loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the apartment, property damage in the amount of approximately **$900**, physical discomfort, and distress.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–15 above.

17. Under Massachusetts law, every lease or tenancy includes an implied **covenant of quiet enjoyment**. *(See* **G.L. c. 186, §14**; *Blackett v. Olanoff,* 371 Mass. 714, 716‑718 (1977); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.,* 417 Mass. 273, 283 (1994)).  

18. The covenant protects tenants from substantial interference with the beneficial use and enjoyment of their leased premises caused by the landlord’s acts or failure to act. *(Simon v. Solomon,* 385 Mass. 91, 102‑103 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis,* 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997)).  

19. Defendant had a duty to maintain the Premises free from water leaks and conditions impairing habitability. *(See* **G.L. c. 186, §14; G.L. c. 239, §8A; 105 C.M.R. 410.351, 410.750**).  

20. Defendant’s failure to repair the recurring water infiltration after notice constituted a willful and reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment. *(See* *Simon v. Solomon,* 385 Mass. at 102; *Watkins v. Montgomery County Hous. Auth.,* 48 Mass. App. Ct. 59 (1999)).  

21. Repeated water leaks, persistent dampness, mold odor, and loss of use of part of the apartment are substantial interferences with Plaintiff’s tenancy and amount to a constructive eviction. *(Blackett v. Olanoff,* 371 Mass. at 718‑719; *Hemingway v. Boston Hous. Auth.,* 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973)).  

22. Defendant’s statements that the condition was only “cosmetic” and his repeated refusal to perform proper repairs demonstrate bad faith and conscious disregard of his obligations under law. *(See* *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson,* 379 Mass. 196, 199‑200 (1979)).  

23. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages, and where the violation is willful or knowing, three times her actual damages or not less than three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  

24. The circumstances of this case constitute a **willful** violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14 and related jurisprudence. *(See also* *Goshen v. Valeriano,* 44 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 609 (1998); *Lowery v. Robinson,* 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)).

C. **Award treble damages** or three months’ rent (3 × $1,450 = $4,350), whichever is greater, as authorized by G.L. c. 186, §14, based on Defendant’s willful violation;

D. **Award Plaintiff costs of this action**, including all filing fees and reasonable attorney’s fees if subsequently incurred;

E. **Order Defendant to promptly remediate** all water infiltration and related conditions impairing habitability at the Premises;
