### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5.  On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s minor son, J.J., attended the Defendant’s after-school program at the Brockton Community Center located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  
6.  Defendant advertised and represented to parents that all children would be **supervised at all times** during program activities, including while using the gymnasium.  
7.  At approximately 4:15 p.m. that day, only one staff member was present in the gym supervising approximately twenty children.  
8.  The second staff member assigned to the gym reportedly left to complete paperwork in an office.  
9.  The supervising staff member remained seated near the bleachers looking at her phone and was not paying reasonable attention to the children.  
10.  Several older boys, approximately twelve years of age, began playing rough physical games involving tackling, wrestling, and running on the hardwood gym floor.  
11.  Other children notified the staff member that the play was unsafe, but the staff member disregarded their concerns and responded, “boys will be boys.”  
12.  Shortly thereafter, one of the larger boys tackled J.J., a small eight-year-old child, causing J.J. to strike his head hard on the gym floor.  
13.  J.J. lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and was transported to **Good Samaritan Medical Center Emergency Department** for evaluation and treatment.  
14.  J.J. was diagnosed with a **concussion** and required several days of rest and medical follow-up.  
15.  As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately **$5,500** in medical expenses and **$1,200** in lost wages while caring for his injured child.  
16.  Plaintiff and his son have endured pain, suffering, anxiety, and disruption of normal activities.

### COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18.  Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff’s minor son to exercise **reasonable care and supervision** while he was participating in the after-school program. See *Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston*, 365 Mass. 320, 327 (1974) (duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent injury to invitees and those entrusted to care).  
19.  Defendant also owed a duty of care arising from its express and implied representations that children in its care would be properly supervised. *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 697 (2000) (liability arises when one undertakes to render services necessary for the protection of another and fails to exercise reasonable care).  
20.  Massachusetts law recognizes that entities responsible for the custody of minors have a duty to provide reasonable supervision to protect those minors from foreseeable harm. See *Wallace v. Wilson*, 411 Mass. 8 (1991); *Morash & Sons, Inc. v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 612 (1973).  
21.  Defendant breached its duty of care by (a) failing to maintain adequate staffing in the gym; (b) permitting one staff member to leave the area; (c) failing to monitor children’s activities; and (d) failing to intervene when dangerous horseplay was reported.  
22.  Such omissions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Addy v. Boston Herald–Traveler Corp.*, 358 Mass. 450, 453 (1970) (negligence is failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonable person would exercise in like circumstances).  
23.  Defendant’s acts and omissions were the **proximate cause** of J.J.’s injuries. *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 104–105 (1978) (foreseeability of harm defines scope of duty and causation).  
24.  Under *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 52–54 (1983), institutions entrusted with students or children are liable for failing to implement reasonable safeguards against foreseeable harm.  
25.  Defendant’s conduct violated G.L. c. 231 §85 (comparative negligence framework), but Plaintiff’s minor child was not negligent and bears no comparative fault.  
26.  Defendant’s failure to act was a substantial factor in causing J.J.’s concussion, emotional distress, and resulting medical and economic losses. *Goodrow v. Lane Bryant, Inc.*, 432 Mass. 165, 173 (2000).  
27.  Plaintiff, as parent and guardian, is entitled to recover for medical expenses, lost wages, and the pain and suffering of his minor child resulting from Defendant’s negligence. See *Thibeault v. Poole*, 283 Mass. 480 (1933).
