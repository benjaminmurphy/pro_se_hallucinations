While the broader Mounsey decision deals with occupier liability, this particular cited page and passage do not clearly support the specific proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a 'licensee' rather than an 'invitee,' or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that 'trespassers' stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential. This tends to perpetuate, although on a smaller scale, the kind of tradition-bound and mistaken analysis that I had supposed the court was aiming to correct.\""

The case does not hold that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of any particular injuries; it only reverses summary judgment on duty so that a jury may determine breach, causation, and damages.

The court\u2019s reasoning and holding focus exclusively on the host\u2019s duty and control over alcohol, not on the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct or standard of care.
