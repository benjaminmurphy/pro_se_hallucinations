Olanoff concerns excessive noise from a nearby lounge that the landlord introduced and had the power to control, not physical defects or unsafe conditions inside the leased unit. The case stands for the principle that a landlord\u2019s conduct (including failure to abate external disturbances they can control) can constitute constructive eviction, but it does not specifically address failure to repair internal apartment defects or safety hazards.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done... Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable."
