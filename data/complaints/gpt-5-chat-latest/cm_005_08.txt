### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**PARTIES**

1. **Petitioner:** Emily Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the mother of the minor children, Sophie Johnson (age 10) and Jacob Johnson (age 8).  
2. **Respondent:** Michael Smith, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the father of the same minor children.  
3. The parties are governed by a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered by this Honorable Court on **April 15, 2021**.

---

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as this action seeks modification of an existing Probate and Family Court custody judgment concerning minor children domiciled in Bristol County.  
5. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** because the existing order was issued here and both children reside within the county.

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. The current custody arrangement, ordered April 15, 2021, grants the parties **joint legal custody**, with the children residing primarily with the Petitioner and parenting time to the Respondent on a regular schedule every other weekend.  
7. The Judgment further provides that both parents shall foster the children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparaging comments regarding one another in the children’s presence.  
8. Over the past year, the Respondent has unilaterally enrolled the children in extracurricular activities that fall during the Petitioner’s scheduled weekends, without consultation or mutual agreement, in violation of the intent and cooperative obligations of joint legal custody.  
9. Respondent has made disparaging statements to the children about the Petitioner, including calling her “selfish” and suggesting she “does not really love them” when she seeks to adjust the schedule for clarity or family needs.  
10. As a result, the children have experienced emotional distress—specifically, their daughter has begun having stomach aches and anxiety on transition days between homes.  
11. These developments constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the existing order, adversely affecting the children’s emotional well-being.  
12. The present arrangement is no longer serving the children’s best interests because ongoing parental conflict has eroded cooperation necessary for joint legal custody.  
13. The Petitioner has maintained stable housing, steady employment, and continuous care of the children, and is best positioned to provide consistency, stability, and emotional security.  
14. Clearer delineation of decision-making authority and parenting time is required to safeguard the children’s welfare and to minimize conflict between the parties.

**APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES**

15. Modification of custody requires a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and a showing that modification is in the children’s **best interests**. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006).  
16. The Court has continuing jurisdiction to alter custody orders when necessary to promote the children’s welfare under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**; see also *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
17. A breakdown in parental communication sufficient to impair joint decision-making may justify modification. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405–406 (1981).  
18. The best interests standard remains paramount, requiring consideration of each parent’s ability to provide for the children’s emotional and physical needs. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976).  
19. Persistent disparagement of a co-parent in the children’s presence can constitute a change warranting modification because it undermines children’s emotional health and stability. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 496 (2012).  
20. Joint legal custody presumes the ability of the parents to communicate and cooperate effectively; where cooperation breaks down, modification to sole legal custody may be proper. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 546–47 (2010); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 263 (2001).  
21. The integrity of parenting time must be preserved to maintain children’s relationships with each parent, and unilateral scheduling decisions contrary to a court order may warrant adjustment. *Mazzone v. Mazzone*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 435 (2001).  
22. Massachusetts law requires that any custody modification promote stability, predictability, and consistency in the children’s environment. *Adoption of Nancy*, 443 Mass. 512, 517 (2005); *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243 (2000).  
23. Where cooperation has deteriorated and the children show emotional distress resulting from parental conflict, the Court has discretion to modify custody accordingly. *Guardianship of Clyde*, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 767, 772 (1998).

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the April 15, 2021 Judgment;  
2. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Petitioner **sole legal custody** of the minor children, Sophie Johnson and Jacob Johnson;  
3. Designate the Petitioner’s residence as the children’s **primary residence**;  
4. Establish a **parenting-time schedule** for the Respondent that promotes meaningful contact but prevents unilateral changes and interference with the Petitioner’s custodial time;  
5. Order both parties to refrain from making disparaging remarks about the other in the presence of the children;  
6. Clarify that enrollment in extracurricular or school activities shall require advance written consent of both parents or, if consent is not obtained, approval of the custodial parent;  
7. Grant such **other and further relief** as this Court deems just and proper to ensure the best interests and welfare of the minor children.
