Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK TAYLOR,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  
**(G.L. c. 208, §28; G.L. c. 209C, §20)**

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Lisa Taylor**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §28 and related Massachusetts law, for a modification of the existing custody order entered on **May 20, 2015**, in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Lisa Taylor**, resides in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Her contact information is as follows: telephone (617) 555‑0123; email **psm1443@gmail.com**.

2. The Defendant, **Mark Taylor**, resides in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - **Emily Taylor**, born [_____] (age 10 as of the date of this Complaint).

---

### **II. JURISDICTION**

4. This Honorable Court has **continuing jurisdiction** over matters of custody and visitation concerning the minor child pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, §28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §20**, and **G.L. c. 215, §6**.

5. Venue in Middlesex County is proper because both parties reside within the jurisdiction and the original custody judgment was entered by this Court.

---

### **III. PRIOR JUDGMENT**

6. On **May 20, 2015**, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court issued a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time that granted **primary physical custody of Emily Taylor to the Defendant, Mark Taylor**, and **limited parenting time to the Plaintiff**, consisting of alternating weekend visits and one midweek dinner.

7. That judgment was appropriate at the time, given the then‑existing circumstances: the Plaintiff was enrolled in a graduate program, lived in a small studio apartment, and had a limited and inflexible schedule.

---

### **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Substantial and material changes have occurred since the entry of the 2015 custody judgment, warranting a modification under **G.L. c. 208, §28** and Massachusetts case law.

9. Specifically:

   a. The Plaintiff has **completed her graduate education**, obtained **stable full‑time employment** with regular hours, and can now provide consistent, day‑to‑day care.  
   
   b. The Plaintiff now resides in a **two-bedroom apartment** where Emily has her own room, providing a stable and appropriate home environment.  
   
   c. The Plaintiff and the minor child have **developed a strong, nurturing, and positive parent‑child relationship**, as confirmed by the child’s **treating therapist**.  
   
   d. The minor child, Emily Taylor, **expresses distress** when required to leave after short visits and has conveyed, both verbally and through a letter to the Court, her **desire for more overnight time with her mother**.  
   
   e. The Defendant, Mark Taylor, **refuses to discuss or consider adjustments** to the schedule and reacts negatively when the child expresses her wishes, creating emotional pressure for the child.  
   
   f. The child’s maturity and emotional development at age ten now allow her to benefit from additional time with each parent and a more balanced custodial schedule.

10. These changes constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting Emily’s welfare and justify modification of the prior custody order. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

---

### **V. LEGAL STANDARD**

11. Under **G.L. c. 208, §28**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of (1) a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior order, and (2) that modification serves the **best interests of the child**.

12. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that when the circumstances relevant to a child’s welfare have changed, the Court must revisit custody in the child’s best interests. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

13. The court’s paramount consideration is the **best interests of the child**, informed by stability, parental fitness, and the quality of each parent–child relationship. See **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

14. In considering a modification, the Court may weigh the child’s expressed preferences when age and maturity warrant, especially where corroborated by evidence of emotional benefit. See **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); **Pierce v. Pierce**, 455 Mass. 286 (2009); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

15. Where one parent’s circumstances have improved and permit greater stability and caretaking responsibility, modification expanding that parent’s parenting time promotes the best interests of the child. See **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); **Roe v. Roe**, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 168 (1994).

---

### **VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

16. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time judgment to reflect that:

   a. The Plaintiff, **Lisa Taylor**, shall have **increased physical custody**, including alternating weeks and shared holidays or such schedule as the Court finds to be in the best interests of the minor child; or, in the alternative,  

   b. The Plaintiff shall have **primary physical custody** or substantially expanded parenting time consistent with Emily’s best interests;  

   c. The parties shall continue to share **legal custody**, or the Court may revise legal custody as necessary to protect the child’s emotional well‑being.

17. The requested modification serves **Emily’s best interests** by ensuring continuity, emotional health, and nurturing involvement of both parents.

---

### **VII. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Lisa Taylor**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 20, 2015 custody order;  
2. **Modify** the existing order to provide the Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, with increased or primary physical custody, and an expanded parenting schedule consistent with Emily’s needs and preferences;  
3. **Order** such additional parenting time, communication, and cooperation provisions as are necessary to serve the child’s best interests;  
4. **Grant** such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### **VIII. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE**

I, **Lisa Taylor**, certify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the facts stated in this Complaint are true to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.

  
Date: **December 1, 2025**  
Respectfully submitted,
