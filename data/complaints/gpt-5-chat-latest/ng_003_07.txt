### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully on Defendant’s premises as a business invitee, shopping for kitchen items in the store located at **110 Market Street, Lowell, MA**.  
6. Defendant stacked large boxes of kitchen appliances—each heavy and bulky—on tall shelves, approximately five to six boxes high.  
7. No securing devices, barriers, or aisle guards were used to prevent boxes from falling from elevated positions.  
8. Another customer, while pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, lightly bumped a lower shelf in a normal, foreseeable manner.  
9. As a result of the bump, a heavy **toaster-oven box** from near the top shelf fell directly onto Plaintiff’s head and shoulder.  
10. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and head pain, and store staff, including the manager, responded to the incident.  
11. An **incident report** was completed by the store manager, and Plaintiff was offered a store coupon in lieu of further remedial action.  
12. That evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened. Plaintiff sought care in the emergency department the same day, where he was diagnosed with a **mild concussion** and **shoulder strain**.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,800 in medical expenses** and lost approximately **$600 in wages** during recovery.  
14. Plaintiff, a delivery driver, was unable to work for several days and could not participate in his regular recreational soccer league for approximately one month.  
15. Defendant, through its employees, owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to ensure that merchandise was properly secured to prevent foreseeable accidents.  
16. Defendant breached this duty by failing to:  
   a. Secure merchandise stacked above customer head level;  
   b. Provide warnings of potential falling merchandise; and  
   c. Adhere to safe merchandising practices known in the retail industry.  
17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injury, medical expenses, lost wages, and ongoing discomfort.

### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under **Massachusetts law**, a property owner or occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any unreasonable dangers of which the owner knows or should know.  *Mounsey v. Ellard*, **363 Mass. 693** (1973).  
20. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, the highest duty of care to maintain safe aisles and shelving. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, **457 Mass. 368** (2010).  
21. Defendant breached its duty by negligently stacking and failing to secure merchandise, creating a foreseeable risk of falling objects, contrary to the standard articulated in *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, **363 Mass. 165** (1973) (duty to protect against reasonably foreseeable hazards).  
22. Defendant’s failure to inspect or remedy dangerous shelf conditions constitutes negligence under *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, **465 Mass. 148** (2013) (landowners liable for hazards created by failure to act reasonably).  
23. The condition of Defendant’s merchandise display amounted to a hidden hazard that Defendant knew or should have known of through reasonable inspection, as recognized in *Barry v. Beverly Enterprises–Massachusetts, Inc.*, **418 Mass. 590** (1994).  
24. The injuries and losses incurred by Plaintiff were the **direct and proximate result** of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions. See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, **437 Mass. 312** (2002).  
25. Defendant’s conduct violated the general duty of care established by **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, requiring apportionment of fault only where the plaintiff’s negligence exceeds that of the defendant; here, Plaintiff was not negligent.  
26. Defendant’s lack of merchandise-safety procedures breached standards of care consistent with *Peshkin v. Lynn Sand & Stone Co.*, **427 Mass. 463** (1998), which emphasizes foreseeability and prevention of injury.  
27. Plaintiff’s injuries were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s unsafe shelf arrangements, which constitute negligence under *Jurkowski v. McPhee*, **301 Mass. 242** (1938).  
28. Defendant’s conduct caused personal injuries and economic harm to Plaintiff, entitling Plaintiff to damages cognizable under **Massachusetts common law of negligence**. See also *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, **411 Mass. 401** (1991); and *Poole v. Classon Enters., Inc.*, **74 Mass. App. Ct. 635** (2009).

### DAMAGES

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical injuries, pain, and mental anguish;  
   b. Medical bills totaling approximately **$1,800**;  
   c. Lost wages totaling approximately **$600**; and

30. Plaintiff continues to endure residual discomfort and inconvenience as a result of the incident.
