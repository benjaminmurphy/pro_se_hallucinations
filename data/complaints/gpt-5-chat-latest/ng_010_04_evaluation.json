It does not mention Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7364, adjacent ways, or any specific duty to persons lawfully using adjacent public ways. While the *Mounsey* majority opinion may address such duties, this excerpt alone does not establish or adopt \u00a7364 or impose liability on that basis, so it cannot be said to support the proposition as framed.",

The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors.

While the facts involve ice rather than a tree branch, the opinion\u2019s reasoning is framed broadly as premises liability doctrine, not limited to frozen precipitation, and is routinely cited for the general proposition that outdated categorical distinctions yield to a reasonable-care analysis.
