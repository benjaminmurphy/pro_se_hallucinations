The opinion does not address failures to maintain premises in a habitable or watertight physical condition (e.g., leaks, structural defects); instead, it deals with noise disturbances as the interfering condition.

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge\u2026 we decline to perpetuate that distinction where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\u201d"
