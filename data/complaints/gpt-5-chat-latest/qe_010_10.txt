---

2. **Defendant Laura Bennett** (“Defendant”) is an individual doing business as a residential landlord and the owner of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction under G.L. c. 218, §19 and G.L. c. 185C, §3, as the amount in controversy is less than $25,000 and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court because the Premises are located within the judicial district of this Court.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the Premises for residential use at a monthly rent of $1,200.  
6. Plaintiff has paid rent consistently and has not violated any material terms of the tenancy.  
7. Beginning approximately in August 2025, Plaintiff noticed mold growth in the bathroom of the Premises, initially in the corner of the shower and later spreading to the ceiling.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the mold condition.  
9. Defendant inspected the bathroom, acknowledged the presence of mold, and attributed it to Plaintiff’s showering habits, claiming that Plaintiff took showers that were “too hot and too long” and failed to run the exhaust fan sufficiently.  
10. The bathroom lacks a window and relies solely on a ceiling exhaust fan for ventilation.  
11. Plaintiff regularly runs the fan while showering, but despite doing so, the mold problem persisted and worsened.  
12. After the onset of the mold problem, Plaintiff began to suffer respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing. Plaintiff’s physician advised that these symptoms were likely linked to mold exposure and recommended remediation.  
13. Plaintiff had to discard mold-damaged personal items, including a shower curtain and towels, valued at approximately $60.  
14. Defendant has refused to take meaningful steps to remediate the mold or to address the inadequate ventilation that enables its recurrence.  
15. Defendant’s refusal has rendered the bathroom unsanitary and unsafe, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.  
16. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered physical discomfort, property loss, and loss of enjoyment of the Premises. Plaintiff estimates her damages to be $300.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)**

17. Plaintiff re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. A landlord may not willfully or negligently interfere with a tenant’s right to the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
19. Under Massachusetts law, substantial interference with the tenant’s use of the premises caused by the landlord’s neglect of maintenance or repair obligations constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
20. Landlords are obligated to maintain premises in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. §410.000 et seq. Failure to maintain safe and sanitary conditions can amount to a breach of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); **Davis v. Comerford**, 483 Mass. 164 (2019).  
21. The presence of mold and unsafe levels of moisture constitute conditions “which may endanger or materially impair the health or safety of occupants,” in violation of 105 C.M.R. §410.750 and §410.550.  
22. Defendant’s acts and omissions—including failing to repair the ventilation and remediate ongoing mold despite notice—constitute negligent and willful interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Cruickshank v. Boschma**, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 638 (2007).  
23. Defendant’s conduct was not an isolated act but an ongoing pattern of neglect that substantially impaired Plaintiff’s comfort, health, and enjoyment of her home. *See* **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).  
24. The breach of this covenant entitles Plaintiff to actual damages, and under G.L. c. 186, §14, recovery may include three months’ rent or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. *See* **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  
25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages including but not limited to health-related harm, loss of use of parts of her home, and property loss.
