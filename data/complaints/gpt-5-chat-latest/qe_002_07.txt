### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Maya Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Lisa Thompson (“Defendant”), and for her Complaint states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maya Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Unit, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  
2. Defendant Lisa Thompson is an individual residing and/or doing business as the landlord of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 212, § 3** and **M.G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this matter involves landlord-tenant claims arising within the City of Boston.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the leased premises are located within its territorial jurisdiction.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for tenancy of a basement apartment at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA, at a monthly rent of $1,200.  
6. Plaintiff has paid rent timely and in full throughout her tenancy, except for a brief two-week delay in October 2025, which Plaintiff rectified with payment including any owed late fee.  
7. In or around November 2025, Plaintiff began observing water seeping into the basement apartment through the wall during periods of rain.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message regarding the water intrusion, and Defendant replied that she would “look into it.”  
9. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to take any reasonable steps to repair or remediate the water infiltration problem.  
10. By late November 2025, the water leakage had worsened, damaging Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a wooden bookshelf, with an estimated total loss of $400.  
11. Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department, which inspected the property and documented water intrusion and additional housing code violations pursuant to **105 C.M.R. 410.000** (State Sanitary Code, Chapter II).  
12. Since that inspection, Defendant has failed and refused to correct the water infiltration and related code issues, in violation of her statutory and common-law duties to maintain the premises in a habitable condition.  
13. Plaintiff has been forced to operate a dehumidifier continuously to control the dampness, resulting in increased utility costs and diminished use and enjoyment of the premises.  
14. Following Plaintiff’s contact with city inspectors, Defendant referred to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and has informed Plaintiff that Defendant intends not to renew the lease upon expiration in March 2026, citing the late October rent as pretext.  
15. The water infiltration, persistent dampness, property damage, and retaliatory conduct have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and beneficial use of her home.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises is liable for damages or statutory penalties.  
18. Defendant’s failure to repair persistent water intrusion and to comply with inspection directives constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy, violating the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
19. The covenant protects tenants from serious interferences with their tenancy caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions, whether deliberate or negligent. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
20. Defendant’s failure to maintain watertight, habitable conditions breaches statutory and common-law obligations of habitability and quiet enjoyment. See **Hemingway v. O’Brien**, 378 Mass. 369 (1979); **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  
21. Dampness, leakage, and unsanitary conditions constitute interference with quiet enjoyment where they materially impair the character and value of the premises. See **Armstrong v. Cuffley**, 389 Mass. 351 (1983); **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).  
22. Defendant’s inaction following notice from Plaintiff and the City constitutes “direct or indirect interference” as defined by statute and case law. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
23. Defendant’s retaliatory behavior in threatening nonrenewal of the lease after Plaintiff sought enforcement of building code obligations also constitutes an interference and violation of **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14** and **M.G.L. c. 186, § 18**. See **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); **Spence v. O'Brien**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983).  
24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered loss of property ($400), increased utility expenses, emotional distress, discomfort, and loss of peaceful enjoyment of her home.  
25. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages or three months’ rent (three times $1,200), whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, notwithstanding that Plaintiff is self-represented.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages equal to three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual damages, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff reimbursement of $400 for property damage and incidental costs;  
D. Order Defendant to correct ongoing conditions of water intrusion and related code violations forthwith;
