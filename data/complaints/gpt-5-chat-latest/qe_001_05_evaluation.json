In doing so, it emphasizes that landlord liability for interfering with quiet enjoyment is broader than deliberate wrongdoing and is grounded in failure to maintain sanitary, habitable conditions, including essential services. While this case involves flooding rather than heat/utilities specifically, its reasoning squarely supports the principle that serious failures in essential habitability services can breach quiet enjoyment absent deliberate intent.",

It remands for fact-finding on whether the landlord\u2019s omissions regarding drug activity in common areas caused serious interference, and expressly notes there is no authority requiring particular security measures; it does not articulate any rule about heat or essential utilities, nor does it speak to liability absent deliberate wrongdoing in that context.
