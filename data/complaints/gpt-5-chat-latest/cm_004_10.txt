# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; c. 209C, § 20; Supplemental Probate and Family Court Rule 26)

---

## I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff, Emily Johnson**, of _______ [address intentionally omitted for privacy], Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the mother of minor child **Jacob Smith**, born [date of birth omitted for privacy].  

2. **Defendant, Michael Smith**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.  

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Honorable Court under **Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) c. 215, §§ 3, 6**, and **Supplemental Probate and Family Court Rule 26**, as this action seeks modification of a prior custody judgment entered by this Court.

---

## II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On **May 14, 2019**, the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time**, granting the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, **primary physical custody** of Jacob Smith.  

5. The order provided the Defendant, Michael Smith, with **three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit**, but **no overnight parenting time**, based primarily on his then-living situation in a shared apartment that did not have appropriate accommodations for the minor child.

---

## III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. Since the entry of the May 14, 2019 order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances warranting modification of custody and parenting time under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**.  

7. The minor child **Jacob Smith is now eight years old**, attends elementary school full-time, and has significantly different developmental, educational, and social needs than when the original order was entered.  

8. The Defendant, Michael Smith, now resides in a **stable, independent apartment** where Jacob has **his own bedroom and personal space** suitable for overnight parenting time.  

9. The current parenting schedule—consisting of short weekday visits and Sunday afternoons—requires frequent travel between homes, disrupts school routines, and contributes to exhaustion and stress for the child.  

10. Both parents recognize the current schedule no longer aligns with Jacob's best interests.  

11. The minor child has expressed a clear and consistent desire for **overnight visits** with his father, reflecting his maturity and strengthening relationship with both parents.  

12. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, supports a more developmentally appropriate schedule consistent with Jacob’s stability, emotional well-being, and school schedule.

13. The material changes demonstrate that the circumstances underlying the original custody judgment have altered so substantially that continuation of the existing order no longer serves the **best interests of the child**, the standard mandated by **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a)**.

---

## IV. GOVERNING LAW AND AUTHORITIES

14. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody judgment may be modified if the Court finds that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred and that modification is **necessary in the best interests of the child**.  

15. **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20** similarly authorizes custody modification judgments where circumstances materially change.  

16. The Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have repeatedly held that the standard for custody modification requires both a **material change in circumstances** and a showing that modification is in the child’s **best interests**. See:  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - *Mazzone v. Mazzone*, 429 Mass. 152 (1999);  
   - *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998);  
   - *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998);  
   - *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976);  
   - *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006);  
   - *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).  

17. Massachusetts courts have routinely acknowledged that when a child matures and their daily needs shift—such as beginning school or developing stronger bonds with both parents—such developments may constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances**. See *Mason v. Coleman*, supra; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, supra.  

18. Courts further recognize that ensuring a consistent, stable, and age-appropriate schedule that supports a child’s education and emotional well-being advances the **best interests of the child**, the paramount consideration in any custody determination. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840; *Vilakazi*, 371 Mass. at 410.

## V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

19. In light of the material and substantial changes described above, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting order as follows:

   a. That the parties retain **joint legal custody** of Jacob Smith (if already in place);  
   b. That physical custody remain primarily with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, subject to a modified **parenting plan** granting the Defendant, Michael Smith:  
      - Regular **overnight parenting time on alternating weekends**, commencing Friday after school and ending Sunday evening; and  
      - Reasonable midweek contact, if consistent with Jacob’s school schedule;  
   c. That holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time be adjusted accordingly to reflect the new overnight structure;  
   d. That the modified order otherwise provide such further relief as is just and proper under the circumstances.

## VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the May 14, 2019 custody order;

3. Issue a **Modified Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** consistent with the proposals herein; and  
4. Grant any other relief this Court deems **fair and equitable** under the laws of the Commonwealth.
