# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

### INTRODUCTION
Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Martinez**, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on September 15, 2021, pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, to provide for supervised or otherwise conditioned visitation between the minor child, **Ethan Thompson (age 8)**, and the Defendant, **Michael Thompson**, due to a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and best interests.

---

### PARTIES
1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Martinez**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Thompson, born in 2017.  
2. The Defendant, **Michael Thompson**, likewise resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.  
3. The original custody and visitation order was issued by this Court on **September 15, 2021**, granting **shared legal custody** with primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and regular weekend parenting time to the Defendant.

---

### JURISDICTION
4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody and visitation arrangements pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the original order was entered by this Court and the parties and child remain residents of the Commonwealth.

---

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND
5. At the time of the 2021 order, the Court found both parents to be stable and capable of cooperative parenting.  
6. In the two years since that order, a **material change in circumstances** has occurred.  
7. The minor child, Ethan, has made multiple statements indicating concerning conditions during visits with the Defendant, including mention of “special drinks” and observing the Defendant “not walking straight.”  
8. A neighbor has provided video evidence showing the Defendant stumbling while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night, suggesting possible intoxication.  
9. School personnel have reported that Ethan regularly appears **exhausted and unfocused on Mondays**, often following weekend visitation with the Defendant.  
10. The Plaintiff reasonably believes that these circumstances demonstrate impaired judgment on the part of the Defendant during parenting time, creating a risk to Ethan’s physical safety and emotional stability.  
11. These facts were unforeseen at the time of the original order and constitute a **significant change of circumstances** under Massachusetts law.  
12. The Plaintiff remains committed to supporting Ethan’s healthy relationship with his father but seeks the Court’s intervention to ensure the child’s safety.

### LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION
13. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, custody provisions may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and when the modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  
14. A similar standard applies to nonmarital parents under **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**.  
15. The guiding principle is always the **child’s best interests**. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).  
16. Courts have consistently held that a change materially affecting the child’s welfare, including evidence of parental incapacity or conduct detrimental to the child, justifies modification. *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  
17. Evidence suggesting substance abuse or endangerment during parenting time constitutes a material change warranting review. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  
18. Visitation conditions or supervision are appropriate remedies when the court determines that unrestricted visitation jeopardizes the child’s safety or emotional stability. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Kendall v. Kendall*, 426 Mass. 238 (1997).  
19. The Court has broad equitable authority under **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6** to impose protective conditions consistent with the child’s best interests.  
20. The burden of proving a material change rests with the moving party, and the Plaintiff has met that burden through credible observations, school records, and supporting evidence. *Adoption of Ilona*, 459 Mass. 53 (2011); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 90 (2015).

### REQUESTED RELIEF
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Martinez**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the custody order dated September 15, 2021;  
B. Modify said order to provide that the Defendant’s **parenting time** shall be **supervised** or conditioned as the Court deems appropriate for the minor child’s safety and well-being;  
C. Maintain **shared legal custody** unless otherwise determined to be inconsistent with the child’s best interests;  
D. Order that both parties participate in any recommended evaluation, substance abuse assessment, or parent education program as determined by the Court; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
