# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

### **I. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Samantha Greene**, pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the inherent equity powers of this Honorable Court, and respectfully petitions for a *Complaint for Modification* of the existing custody judgment entered by this Court on **May 15, 2018**, regarding the parties’ minor child, **Emily Greene (age 12)**.  

The Plaintiff states that a substantial and material change in circumstances has arisen since entry of the prior judgment such that modification of the current custody arrangement is necessary to protect and serve the *best interests of the child*, as required by **G.L. c. 208, § 31** and established caselaw.

### **II. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**

1. **Plaintiff:** Samantha Greene, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555‑0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** James Greene, also residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the parents of **Emily Greene**, born [Insert birthdate], age 12.  
4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time matters pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the underlying Order was entered in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court.

### **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

5. On **May 15, 2018**, this Court entered a Judgment establishing joint legal custody and equal 50/50 physical custody, alternating weeks between the parties.  
6. For several years, the shared parenting schedule functioned well. Both parents resided in close proximity, cooperated for Emily’s welfare, and maintained consistent routines between homes.  
7. In or around **2025**, the Defendant, James Greene, was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition.  
8. The condition has resulted in significant mobility impairment. The Defendant has experienced multiple falls in his home and now frequently requires a wheelchair or physical assistance.  
9. The Defendant’s treating physician has advised against the Defendant being alone with the child in settings involving stairs or requiring mobility and rapid physical response.  
10. Despite these limitations, the Defendant continues to insist upon maintaining the existing 50/50 schedule, and on several occasions has relied upon the twelve‑year‑old child to assist him in transferring from his wheelchair, moving about the home, and performing household tasks.  
11. These circumstances place inappropriate caretaking responsibilities upon Emily and present safety concerns inconsistent with her age and developmental stage.  
12. The Plaintiff has attempted to discuss a modified schedule that would maintain meaningful contact between Emily and her father while addressing safety and caregiving needs, but the Defendant has refused such adjustments.  
13. The Plaintiff asserts that, due to the Defendant’s medical decline, the current equal physical‑custody arrangement is no longer practicable or in Emily’s best interest.  
14. The requested modification would provide primary physical custody to the Plaintiff, with reasonable parenting time for the Defendant consistent with his physical capacity and medical advice.

### **IV. LEGAL STANDARD AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITY**

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and when modification is necessary in the child’s best interest.  
16. The Court is guided by the principle that *the best interests of the child* are the paramount concern. See **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**.  
17. A parent seeking modification must demonstrate that the earlier judgment’s underlying circumstances have materially changed. See **Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981)**; **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**.  
18. The Court maintains continuing jurisdiction to update custody arrangements as family circumstances evolve. **G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6**.  
19. Massachusetts courts recognize that serious health or medical developments constituting a safety concern for the child qualify as a substantial change. See **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)** (modification warranted by parent’s diminished capacity); **E.N.O. v. L.M.M., 429 Mass. 824 (1999)** (well‑being and safety of child central to custodial determination).  
20. In evaluating custody, courts consider the child’s welfare, stability, and emotional security. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**.  
21. The Court is also guided by **G.L. c. 208, § 31A** (abuse or safety considerations in custody determinations). While no abuse is alleged, the statute reflects the Legislature’s intent to safeguard children from exposure to unsafe or inappropriate caretaking conditions.  
22. Massachusetts law permits modification where continuation of an existing plan would impose inappropriate responsibilities upon a minor child. See **Hale v. Hale, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981)**; **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.  
23. The Plaintiff’s request does not seek to sever the child’s relationship with her father but to ensure that Emily’s safety, developmental needs, and emotional stability remain prioritized during the father’s medical decline, fully consistent with **Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)** and **Care & Protection of Robert, 408 Mass. 52 (1990)**.  
24. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to meet the statutory and equitable standards for custody adjustments in Massachusetts.

### **V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

25. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the Judgment dated May 15, 2018, as follows:

   a. Award **primary physical custody** of Emily Greene to the Plaintiff, **Samantha Greene**.  
   b. Maintain **joint legal custody**, subject to reasonable consultation between the parties.  
   c. Establish a **parenting‑time schedule** for the Defendant consistent with his medical capacity, to be exercised in a safe environment and with any necessary assistive support or supervision.  
   d. Require that all exchanges occur in a manner ensuring the safety of both the Defendant and the minor child.  
   e. Include any additional provisions the Court deems proper to promote Emily’s safety, stability, and emotional welfare.

### **VI. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order;  
2. Modify said order to grant the Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the minor child, with parenting time to the Defendant consistent with his current health condition;  
3. Affirm joint legal custody, unless otherwise determined in the child’s best interest;  
4. Grant such further relief as justice and equity may require.
