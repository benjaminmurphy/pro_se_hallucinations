v.

Defendant.

# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Martinez** (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on **March 15, 2021**, concerning the parties’ minor child, **Sofia Brown (age 8)**. The Plaintiff asserts that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the prior judgment, rendering the current parenting schedule impractical and contrary to the best interests of the child.  

This Complaint is brought pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, applicable to custody modifications, as interpreted by *Mason v. Coleman*, **447 Mass. 177 (2006)**, *Custody of Vaughn*, **422 Mass. 590 (1996)**, and related authorities.

---

## II. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Martinez, primary custodial parent of the minor child, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
   - Contact: (617) 555‑0123, Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** David Brown, father of the minor child, formerly residing in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and now intending to reside in New Hampshire.

---

## III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 30**, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, granting the Probate and Family Court authority to modify prior custody and visitation orders when material changes in circumstances affecting the welfare of a minor child occur.

4. Venue is proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court (Woburn, MA)** because the original judgment was entered here and the child continues to reside within this jurisdiction.  

---

## IV. PRIOR JUDGMENT

5. On **March 15, 2021**, this Court entered a custody and parenting order granting primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and parenting time to the Defendant consisting of Wednesday overnights and alternating weekends.  

6. The prior judgment was entered when both parents resided in the Cambridge area, and the arrangement assumed the child’s school and extracurriculars were local and that travel times between the parties’ homes were minimal.

---

## V. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the entry of the 2021 order, the Defendant, David Brown, has notified the Plaintiff of his intent to **relocate to New Hampshire** for employment purposes.

8. This relocation constitutes a **material change in circumstances** that substantially alters the assumptions underlying the existing custody order.

9. The current schedule, which includes a **midweek overnight visit every Wednesday**, would now require the parties’ eight‑year‑old daughter, Sofia Brown, to endure approximately **ninety minutes of travel each way** between New Hampshire and her school in Middlesex County on school nights.

10. As a result, Sofia would have to wake at an unreasonably early hour to attend school, miss after‑school activities, and suffer increased fatigue and anxiety.

11. The child’s wellbeing and stability have been negatively affected by the current travel demands and related stress, evidencing a substantial impact on her best interests.

12. The proposed relocation and increased travel burden frustrate the intent of the prior order and require modification to preserve the child’s welfare and continued adherence to *Custody of Kali*, **439 Mass. 834 (2003)**, emphasizing the centrality of the child’s best interests.  

13. The Massachusetts courts have long recognized relocation or distance‑based conflicts as material changes in circumstances justifying modification. *See* *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

14. A modification is therefore necessary to align the parenting schedule with the child’s schooling, stability, and emotional wellbeing, consistent with *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, **395 Mass. 704 (1985)**, and *Rosenthal v. Maney*, **51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.

---

## VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

15. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, any modification must serve the child’s best interests. The current order, if left unchanged, would expose Sofia to excessive commuting, disrupt her education, and cause emotional strain.  

16. Massachusetts law instructs the Court to consider the child’s stability, relationship with each parent, and ongoing educational and social development. *See* *Ireland v. Ireland*, **428 Mass. 1006 (1998)**; *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, **371 Mass. 406 (1976)**.  

17. The guiding principle remains the child’s welfare. *See* *Felton v. Felton*, **383 Mass. 232 (1981)**; *Rubin v. Rubin*, **77 Mass. App. Ct. 776 (2010)**; *Canning v. Juskalian*, **33 Mass. App. Ct. 202 (1992)**.  

18. Removal or modification of the midweek overnight would minimize disruptions, reduce travel demands, and maintain consistent weekday routines supportive of Sofia’s growth and education.

---

## VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

Wherefore, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the March 15, 2021 custody order due to the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire;  

B. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting time order to eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight and establish a revised visitation schedule to reflect the current geographic realities, while preserving the child’s strong relationship with both parents;  

C. **Adjust** weekend parenting time as the Court deems appropriate, potentially extending alternate weekend visits or school vacation periods to balance parenting opportunities;  

D. **Enter such further orders** as are consistent with the best interests of the child pursuant to *M.G.L. c. 208, § 28*, *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  

E. **Grant such other and further relief** as this Court deems just and proper.

---

## VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, therefore prays that this Court:

1. Accept this Complaint for Modification;  
2. Schedule a hearing on the merits;  
3. Modify the parenting schedule consistent with the present relocation and in the best interests of the child; and  
4. Issue any additional relief necessary to promote the stability and welfare of the minor child.

---

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025**, in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
