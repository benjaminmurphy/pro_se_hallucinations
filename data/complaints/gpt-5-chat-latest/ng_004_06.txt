(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Jacob Miller (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Emily Johnson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jacob Miller** is an individual residing in Massachusetts. His contact information is (617) 555‑0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant **Emily Johnson** is an individual who owns and manages a three‑unit residential property located at **123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts** (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Venue is proper in the **Worcester District Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the events giving rise to this action occurred within the City of Worcester.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, and was responsible for the maintenance and safety of the sidewalk abutting **123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts**.

6. On or about **February 7–10, 2023**, a snowstorm affected Worcester and left accumulated snow and ice on the sidewalks adjoining the Premises.

7. Defendant undertook to shovel a narrow path down the center of the sidewalk but failed to apply salt, sand, or any other deicing material.

8. Over the next several days, melting snow from daytime temperatures refroze each night, resulting in a large, smooth sheet of ice along the narrow shoveled path.

9. Defendant was aware, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been aware, of this dangerous icy condition. Tenants at the property texted and notified Defendant of the hazardous condition, even sending her photographs of the ice.

10. Defendant replied to at least one tenant that “the sun will take care of it,” thereby acknowledging the condition but intentionally choosing not to take further remedial action.

11. On **February 10, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises delivering groceries to one of Defendant’s tenants.

12. While walking along the shoveled path of the sidewalk adjacent to the Premises, Plaintiff encountered the icy patch and, without warning, slipped and fell violently backward onto the pavement.

13. Plaintiff immediately experienced severe pain in his lower back and was later diagnosed with a back injury that required medical treatment.

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses and suffered **$1,000** in lost wages, along with physical pain, discomfort, and inconvenience.

15. Plaintiff was exercising due care for his own safety at all relevant times.

---

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff repeats and re‑alleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully restated herein.

17. Under **Massachusetts common law**, a property owner owes all lawful visitors a duty to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition and to remove or treat snow and ice hazards after reasonable notice and opportunity. *See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and inspecting the sidewalk abutting her property to prevent dangerous snow and ice accumulations. *See* G.L. c. 84, §§ 15 & 21; *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 435 Mass. 353 (2001).

19. Defendant breached that duty by failing to use reasonable care to eliminate or treat the icy condition after actual notice of its existence. *See* *Collins v. Kenealy*, 341 Mass. 49 (1960).

20. Defendant was further negligent under the principles set forth in *Papadopoulos*, supra, and *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013), holding that landowners may be liable for accumulation of snow or ice when they fail to act reasonably in removing or addressing it.

21. Defendant’s failure to apply salt, sand, or any deicing agent after clearing only a narrow path constituted unreasonable maintenance under *Sweenor v. 162 State St., Inc.*, 361 Mass. 524 (1972).

22. Defendant had actual notice of the hazard when tenants communicated the dangerous condition, making her failure to act a breach of duty under *Bernard v. H.J. Richard & Sons, Inc.*, 344 Mass. 163 (1962).

23. The risk of harm from refreezing was foreseeable, and Defendant’s decision to rely on “the sun” to cure the condition violated the standard of ordinary care articulated in *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).

24. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and subsequent injuries within the meaning of *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006).

25. Plaintiff’s injuries were reasonably foreseeable, and no independent, superseding cause intervened. *See* *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996).

26. Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost income as a direct result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.

27. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for these losses. *See* *Carey v. Malley*, 327 Mass. 189 (1951).

---

### V. DAMAGES

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence:

   a. Plaintiff sustained a **lower back injury**, causing pain, limited movement, and the need for medical care;  
   b. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses;  
   c. Plaintiff lost approximately **$1,000** in wages; and  
   d. Plaintiff has endured pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life.

29. Plaintiff continues to experience ongoing discomfort and medical-related consequences from the fall.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jacob Miller** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant **Emily Johnson**, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $3,500, plus further damages for pain and suffering and impairment;  
B. Costs, interest, and statutory attorney’s fees as permitted by law;  
C. Such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
