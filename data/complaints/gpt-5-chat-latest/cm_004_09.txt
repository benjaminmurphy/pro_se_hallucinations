Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON**,  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Lisa Thompson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the mother and current primary physical custodian of the minor child, **Ethan Johnson**, age 8.  
   Contact: (617) 555‑0123, **psm1443@gmail.com**.  

2. **Defendant:** Mark Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Defendant is the father of Ethan Johnson and currently exercises parenting time pursuant to a custody order dated **April 15, 2018**.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION**

3. This Court has jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, as the matter involves modification of an existing custody and parenting time order previously entered by this Court on April 15, 2018.  

4. Venue is proper because both parties and the minor child reside within Bristol County and the original judgment was issued by this Court.

---

### **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

5. The parties are the parents of one minor child, **Ethan Johnson**, born in 2017.  
6. On **April 15, 2018**, this Court entered a judgment awarding **Lisa Thompson** primary physical custody, with **Mark Johnson** having parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.  
7. At the time of the order, Ethan was three years old, not enrolled in school, and Mark lacked suitable housing, residing in a shared apartment with roommates and no private space for the child.  
8. Since entry of the judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances.**  
   - Mark has obtained stable housing and now occupies his own apartment with a dedicated bedroom for Ethan.  
   - Ethan is eight years old, enrolled in full-time elementary school, and expresses a consistent desire for overnight contact with his father.  
   - The current schedule, consisting of brief weekday visits and no overnights, causes repeated transitions during the school week, contributing to fatigue, difficulty maintaining homework routines, and unnecessary stress upon Ethan and both parents.  
9. Both parties acknowledge that the present order no longer meets the developmental or practical needs of the child and that modification to include reasonable overnight parenting time with the father would serve the child’s best interests.  
10. These changes have occurred since the prior judgment and constitute a **material change in circumstances** warranting revision of the existing custody and parenting-time order.

### **IV. LEGAL STANDARD**

11. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody judgment upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a finding that the modification serves the best interests of the child.  
12. Similarly, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** authorizes modification of a custody or visitation order where such change serves the welfare of the child.  
13. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have repeatedly affirmed that the moving party must show both (a) a material change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (b) that modification will serve the best interests of the child. See:  
    - **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
    - **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
    - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
    - **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
    - **Williams v. Massa**, 431 Mass. 619 (2000);  
    - **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981);  
    - **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012);  
    - **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript);  
    - **Care and Protection of Three Minors**, 392 Mass. 704 (1984);  
    - **G. L. c. 215, § 6** (jurisdiction of Probate and Family Court over custody matters).  
14. Massachusetts courts stress that the best interests of the child are paramount and that increasing a fit parent’s parenting time, where circumstances allow, supports the child’s emotional and psychological welfare. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 840–841.

---

### **V. ARGUMENT AND BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

15. A substantial change has occurred since the 2018 judgment: the father’s housing stability, the child’s maturity and school attendance, and both parents’ recognition of the child’s developmental needs constitute material changes affecting custody arrangements.  
16. Maintaining an outdated schedule designed for a preschool child no longer serves Ethan’s best interests. The law requires custody and parenting-time orders to evolve as the child’s circumstances and welfare evolve. See **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
17. The requested modification aligns with the public policy of Massachusetts favoring frequent and continuing contact between the child and both parents, so long as such contact promotes the child’s welfare. **G.L. c. 208, § 31.**  
18. Allowing overnight parenting time will give Ethan meaningful time with both parents, reduce weekday transitions, and provide consistency and structure conducive to his schooling and emotional development.  
19. No evidence suggests that the father’s home environment is unsafe or unsuitable; rather, the changed living arrangement supports added stability.  
20. These facts satisfy the statutory and common-law prerequisites for modification under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and the precedents cited above.

### **VI. REQUESTED RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Lisa Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the April 15, 2018 custody order;  
B. Determine that modification of custody and parenting time is in the **best interests of the minor child, Ethan Johnson**;  
C. Modify the existing order to provide for an updated parenting plan, including:
   - Regular overnight parenting time for the father, Mark Johnson, consistent with the child’s school schedule and welfare;  
   - Such additional provisions as the Court deems proper regarding holidays, vacations, and transportation; and  
D. Grant such further relief as is just and equitable.
