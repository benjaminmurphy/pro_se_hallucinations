---

### I. PARTIES

1.  Plaintiff Jessica Martin is an individual residing at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as it is a civil action in which the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of the District Court.  
4.  Venue is proper in Hampden County under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the cause of action arose in Springfield, Massachusetts, within this County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5.  Plaintiff and Defendant share a driveway located at the duplex premises at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
6.  Defendant routinely stored a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against a wooden fence along the shared driveway, adjacent to the space where Plaintiff regularly parked her vehicle.  
7.  Prior to the incident, Plaintiff expressed concerns to Defendant on multiple occasions about the safety risk of the precariously placed ladder, particularly during periods of high wind.  
8.  Defendant verbally acknowledged these concerns and stated he would either secure the ladder or move it to a safer location but failed to take any such action.  
9.  On or about **March 15, 2023**, a windstorm occurred in Springfield with strong gusts that were foreseeable in the ordinary course of seasonal weather conditions.  
10.  While Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the driveway, a strong gust of wind knocked Defendant’s unsecured ladder over.  
11.  The ladder crashed onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking the hood and windshield, causing dents and a cracked windshield.  
12.  Plaintiff’s vehicle required professional repairs, including a hood repair and replacement of the windshield.  
13.  Plaintiff incurred expenses for a vehicle insurance deductible, temporary car rental, and other associated costs of repair.  
14.  Plaintiff suffered financial loss, inconvenience, and distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

15.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 14 as though fully set forth herein.  
16.  Under **Massachusetts law**, every person owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably cause injury to others. *See* **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)**; **Luoni v. Berube, 431 Mass. 729 (2000)**.  
17.  Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to properly secure or safely store personal property (the ladder) on a shared driveway where it posed a known and foreseeable risk of harm. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)** (recognizing a duty to prevent foreseeable harm from dangerous conditions on one’s property).  
18.  Defendant breached his duty of care by allowing the ladder to remain unsecured in a location susceptible to wind and in proximity to Plaintiff’s vehicle in a condition that could foreseeably result in property damage. *See* **Gamache v. Mayor of North Adams, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 291 (1983)** (failure to take ordinary precautions constitutes negligence).  
19.  Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of the March 15, 2023 incident and Plaintiff’s resulting property damage and financial losses. *See* **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996)**.  
20.  The harm Plaintiff suffered was foreseeable and within the scope of risk created by Defendant’s recognized inaction. *See* **Abramian v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, 432 Mass. 107 (2000)**.  
21.  Defendant’s negligence constitutes actionable failure to exercise reasonable care under **Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 231, § 85**, as Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care of an ordinarily prudent person in similar circumstances. *See* **Ulwick v. DeChristopher, 411 Mass. 401 (1991)**.  
22.  Plaintiff’s contributory negligence, if any, was less than that of Defendant under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and therefore does not bar recovery. *See* **Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 388 Mass. 342 (1983)**.  
23.  As a further basis for liability, Massachusetts premises liability law and negligence principles require owners or occupiers of property to act reasonably to avoid harm to foreseeable persons on adjacent property. *See* **Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995)**; **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc., 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002)**; **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**.

### V. DAMAGES

24.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage to her automobile, including a dented hood and cracked windshield.  
25.  Plaintiff incurred actual monetary losses, including repair costs, an insurance deductible, and rental car fees during the repair period.  
26.  Plaintiff also suffered the loss of use and enjoyment of her vehicle, inconvenience, and emotional distress associated with the negligent incident.  
27.  Plaintiff demands judgment in an amount to be determined at trial but reasonably believed to exceed $7,500, exclusive of interest and costs.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
A.  Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;  
B.  Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, together with costs, interest, and all other relief as justice requires;  
C.  Award such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**.
