### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and venue is proper in the Berkshire County Probate and Family Court, which issued the underlying custody judgment on June 15, 2021.

4. Both parties and the minor children continue to reside within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, conferring continuing jurisdiction upon this Court for purposes of custody modification.

---

### **RELEVANT FACTS AND HISTORY**

5. The Judgment of Custody entered June 15, 2021, awarded **primary physical custody** of the minor children to the Plaintiff, with the Defendant receiving **parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit**.

6. At the time of the 2021 custody judgment, **neither parent was in a committed relationship**, and no provisions were included concerning exposure of the children to third parties or new partners.

7. The Defendant, Jessica Davis, now **resides with and cohabits** an individual (hereinafter “the live‑in partner”) who, upon information and belief, possesses a **criminal record for assault and battery** and was previously **subject to a restraining order** for domestic violence involving a former partner.

8. The minor children have reported that this live‑in partner frequently **yells, slams doors,** and has, on at least one occasion, **grabbed one of the children, leaving a visible mark on the child’s arm.**

9. On or about a recent occasion, a **neighbor contacted law enforcement** due to a **loud and violent argument** occurring while the children were present at the Defendant’s residence, confirming the volatility of the environment.

10. These circumstances amount to a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the original custody judgment.

11. The exposure of Emily and Noah Ramirez to an individual with a history of violence and to a household marked by emotional volatility poses a **serious risk to their physical safety and emotional wellbeing**.

12. The Plaintiff does not seek to deny the Defendant any relationship with the children, but rather seeks a **modification to ensure their safety** during custodial time, consistent with the **paramount “best interests of the child” standard** under Massachusetts law.

---

### **LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

13. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody or visitation order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and when modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the child**. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

14. The Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly held that a **child’s safety and well-being supersede parental preferences.** See *Adoption of Ilona*, 459 Mass. 53 (2011); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

15. Exposure to domestic violence, instability, or the presence of individuals with violent histories constitutes a **substantial change in circumstances** warranting judicial intervention. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Michel*, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 260 (1990).

16. The “material change” threshold is satisfied when circumstances arise that could **adversely affect a child’s emotional or physical well-being**. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

17. The parent seeking modification bears the burden to demonstrate the change and show that modification is in the children’s best interests. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

18. The Commonwealth’s policy is clear: custody and parenting time must occur in a manner that ensures **a safe, stable, and nurturing environment.** *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); *Doe v. Doe*, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 499 (1983).

19. Courts have discretion to order **supervised parenting time** when a child’s safety or welfare may be compromised by a parent’s companion or household environment. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012).

20. The requested modification — restricting the live‑in partner’s contact with the children or ordering that the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised — is narrowly tailored, protective, and consistent with the **children’s best interests standard** articulated in the above authorities.

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **David Ramirez**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2021 custody order;

B. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting order to **prohibit the Defendant’s live‑in partner** — given the individual’s history of violence and the recent incidents involving the children — **from being present during any parenting time;**

**OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,**

C. **Order that the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised** at a neutral visitation center or under the supervision of an appropriate third party until further order of the Court;

D. **Grant such other and further relief** as justice and equity may require to protect the welfare of the minor children, including but not limited to parenting plan adjustments, safety directives, or counseling orders;

E. **Award attorney’s fees and costs**, if applicable, and any other relief deemed proper under **G.L. c. 208** and **Mass. Prob. & Fam. Ct. Standing Order 1‑06**.
