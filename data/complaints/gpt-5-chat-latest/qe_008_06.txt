---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 186, § 14, as the acts complained of occurred within the jurisdiction of the Chelsea District Court.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential lease with Defendant for the premises located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, MA 02150, beginning on or about January 15, 2022, at a monthly rent of $1,450.

6. From the start of her tenancy, Plaintiff has paid rent as required under the lease and has complied with all terms and conditions imposed upon her as tenant.

7. In or around October 2025, Plaintiff discovered that the main entry door to the building had a broken latch and would not properly close or lock, allowing anyone unrestricted access to the interior common areas of the building.

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of this dangerous and defective condition approximately two months ago, and Defendant assured Plaintiff that he would repair the lock.

9. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated reminders—including at least two subsequent notifications—Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the broken main entry lock.

10. In November 2025, as a result of the unsecured building, unauthorized individuals entered the building’s common areas and rummaged through tenants’ mail and packages. Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately $120, was stolen.

11. Plaintiff has also discovered evidence that an unknown individual has been sleeping in the basement of the building, further compromising her safety and comfort.

12. Fearing for her security, Plaintiff purchased a personal security camera and installed an upgraded deadbolt on her own apartment door, incurring costs of approximately $200.

13. Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns, characterizing her as “overreacting,” and has made no effort to address the defective lock or related safety concerns.

14. The condition of the premises and Defendant’s failure to take prompt action have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and rendered the building less secure, in violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.

15. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages including emotional distress, loss of property, inconvenience, and out-of-pocket expenses totaling approximately $320.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease or tenancy-at-will includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

18. A landlord breaches this covenant when his actions or omissions substantially interfere with a tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

19. Defendant’s failure to secure the building’s entryway and common areas constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment, as it exposed her to security threats, theft, and fear for personal safety. See *Doe v. Springfield Housing Authority*, 428 Mass. 960 (1998); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

20. A landlord’s duty encompasses maintaining common areas in a condition consistent with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment and safety. *Hemenway v. Alphonse*, 408 Mass. 55 (1990); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

21. Defendant deliberately failed to take reasonable steps to restore the security of the premises after receiving notice, thereby “directly or indirectly interfering” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See also *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985).

22. Defendant’s conduct was not only negligent but willful, given Plaintiff’s multiple reports and the foreseeable harm caused by continued inaction. *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).

23. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff sustained actual damages, including stolen property and required expenditures for personal security, entitling her to compensation and statutory remedies pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, including minimum statutory damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and any other relief deemed just and proper. See also *Goreham v. Martins*, 485 Mass. 54 (2020); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).
