2. The defendant, **Michael R. Harrison** (“Defendant”), is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301. Defendant’s address for service of process is believed to be the same or at his business address within the Commonwealth.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, as the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the Brockton District Court.  
4. The amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and the premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **April 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the apartment located at **123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301** (the “Premises”) for a monthly rent of **$1,200.00**.  
6. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Premises as her primary residence and has paid rent in accordance with the lease.  
7. On or about **November 10, 2025**, the hot water service in the Premises ceased functioning.  
8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the loss of hot water the same day.  
9. Defendant responded that the water heater required a replacement part that had been ordered.  
10. After one week, the problem persisted. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the part was “backordered.”  
11. Plaintiff followed up weekly, and by **December 1, 2025**, no repairs had been completed and Plaintiff continued to be without hot water for three consecutive weeks.  
12. Plaintiff was forced to take cold showers, boil water for washing dishes, and transport her infant to her mother’s home for bathing.  
13. Plaintiff also incurred additional out-of-pocket expenses, including a **$30 monthly gym membership** to access shower facilities and additional gas and travel costs.  
14. The absence of hot water constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and renders the apartment unfit for human habitation.  
15. Defendant, despite being notified promptly, failed to repair or restore the hot water in a reasonable time, in violation of his statutory and common-law duties to maintain the Premises in compliance with the state sanitary code and to ensure quiet enjoyment.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14**, and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized under **Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway**, **363 Mass. 184 (1973)**, every residential lease includes a covenant that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment of the rented premises during the term of the tenancy.  
18. The deprivation of essential services, including hot water, may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, **371 Mass. 714 (1977)**; **Simon v. Solomon**, **385 Mass. 91 (1982)**.  
19. Defendant’s failure to maintain hot water service for over three weeks, despite notice and opportunity to cure, constitutes a “serious interference” with Plaintiff’s tenancy and thus a violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**. See also **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, **417 Mass. 273 (1994)**.  
20. The Massachusetts Sanitary Code, **105 C.M.R. 410.190**, requires every dwelling unit to be supplied with hot water in sufficient quantity and at adequate temperature. Violation of the Sanitary Code supports a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Lipsitz v. State Bd. of Sanitarians**, **322 Mass. 556 (1948)**.  
21. The landlord’s duty to repair and maintain essential facilities, including hot water systems, is nondelegable. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, **379 Mass. 196 (1979)**.  
22. Plaintiff’s inability to use essential plumbing and bathing facilities constitutes a deprivation of a “materially habitable environment.” **Hemingway, supra**; **Young v. Patukonis**, **24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)**.  
23. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment” of a tenant’s premises is liable for **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
24. Plaintiff has incurred damages in the amount of at least **$450.00**, representing partial loss of value of the premises during the period of deprivation, plus incidental expenses.  
25. Defendant’s conduct was at least negligent, and his failure to promptly restore essential services constitutes a per se breach of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. See **Lowery v. Robinson**, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**; **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, **424 Mass. 847 (1997)**.  
26. Defendant’s breach directly caused Plaintiff inconvenience, discomfort, loss of use of the premises, and out-of-pocket losses.  
27. Plaintiff is entitled to damages under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, in an amount equal to three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, together with costs.

D. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** (even if self-represented, such fees may be considered for statutory purposes); and
