## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was walking along the public sidewalk abutting 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
6. A large maple tree was located on or adjacent to Defendant’s property, with a major branch extending over the public sidewalk.  
7. For a significant period prior to July 15, 2023, that branch appeared visibly cracked, drooping, and unstable.  
8. Several neighbors, upon information and belief, reported the dangerous condition to Defendant and advised him to contact an arborist or otherwise remove or prune the damaged limb.  
9. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated he would “deal with it in the spring,” but failed to take any action to inspect, prune, or make the branch safe.  
10. On July 15, 2023, during a moderate summer thunderstorm—typical for that season in Pittsfield and not involving any extraordinary weather events—the defective branch snapped and fell onto the sidewalk.  
11. Plaintiff was lawfully walking along the sidewalk carrying groceries when the falling branch struck her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground.  
12. As a direct result of this impact, Plaintiff sustained a painful shoulder strain, extensive bruising, and associated injuries requiring medical treatment.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $600 in wages from missed work.  
14. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent shoulder discomfort and emotional distress resulting from the incident.  
15. Defendant had a duty to use reasonable care to maintain trees on his property so as not to create a foreseeable risk of harm to persons lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk.  
16. Defendant breached this duty by failing to inspect, maintain, or remove a clearly hazardous tree limb that he knew or should have known posed a danger to pedestrians.  
17. Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

## III. CAUSE OF ACTION

### **Count I – Negligence**

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under Massachusetts law, property owners owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain their property and any artificial or natural conditions thereon so as to prevent foreseeable harm to others (see *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Schofield v. Merrill*, 386 Mass. 244 (1982)).  
20. The duty of reasonable care extends to maintaining trees and limbs adjacent to public sidewalks to prevent injury to passersby (see *Gerhardt v. Burris*, 346 Mass. 629 (1964); *Gallagher v. City of Worcester*, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 946 (1983)).  
21. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the defective tree limb and that failure to remedy it created a foreseeable risk of bodily harm to persons lawfully using the adjacent sidewalk.  
22. Defendant’s inaction constitutes a breach of the standard of care recognized in Massachusetts tort law (see *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 363; *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); *Janosky v. Preferred Mutual Ins. Co.*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 518 (1987)).  
23. The harm to Plaintiff was a foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, satisfying the element of causation (see *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101 (1978); *Sullivan v. O’Connor*, 363 Mass. 579 (1973)).  
24. Plaintiff’s injuries, including physical pain, medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress, were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s breach (see *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540 (1982)).  
25. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for her personal injuries, economic losses, and pain and suffering (see *Donahue v. Stephens*, 342 Mass. 89 (1961); M.G.L. c. 231, §§ 85, 85A).

## IV. DAMAGES

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   - Bodily injury including a shoulder strain and extensive bruising;  
   - Medical expenses of approximately $2,500;  
   - Lost wages of approximately $600;  
   - Pain and suffering; and  
   - Emotional distress and inconvenience.  
27. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend these damages as discovery progresses and evidence of additional harm emerges.

## V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but reasonably believed to exceed $25,000;
