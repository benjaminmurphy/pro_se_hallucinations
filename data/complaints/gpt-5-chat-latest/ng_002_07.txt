## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Greenough Park is a public park located in Newton, Massachusetts, maintained by the City of Newton and open to the general public.  
7. Prominent signage in the park requires all dogs to be kept on leashes at all times.  
8. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a public footpath in Greenough Park.  
9. At approximately 4:15 p.m., Defendant was present in the same area with his large dog, which was unleashed, notwithstanding the posted rules and ordinances requiring dogs to be restrained.  
10. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet from his dog, conversing with others, with the leash over his shoulder but unattached to the dog.  
11. Suddenly and without warning, Defendant’s dog ran toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and appearing aggressive.  
12. Fearing an attack and imminent bodily harm, Plaintiff swerved off the footpath in an attempt to avoid the approaching animal.  
13. In the course of evading the dog, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root and fell down a small embankment.  
14. As a direct result of this fall, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist and multiple bruises.  
15. The dog stopped running toward Plaintiff only after Plaintiff had fallen, at which time Defendant called the dog back.  
16. Several other park users witnessed the incident.  
17. Plaintiff immediately sought emergency medical treatment, received care at a local hospital, and was required to wear a brace for several weeks.  
18. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $5,500.00 and lost wages of approximately $2,000.00 due to missed work.  
19. Plaintiff also suffered pain, suffering, inconvenience, and emotional distress from the event.

## III. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

20. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.  
21. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to park users, including the Plaintiff, to control his dog and comply with applicable leash requirements. *Anderson v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 148, 151 (1985).  
22. Defendant’s duty arose both under common law principles of negligence (*Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973)), and specific statutory obligations requiring dog owners to restrain their animals in public spaces, including G.L. c. 140, §§ 155, 173, and 174.  
23. Massachusetts law imposes a statutory duty on dog owners to prevent their dogs from running at large. *See* G.L. c. 140, § 173.  
24. Defendant breached that duty by allowing his dog to run loose in Greenough Park, contrary to both posted regulations and statutory mandates.  
25. Defendant’s failure to control his dog was a direct and foreseeable cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (foreseeability central to negligence inquiry).  
26. The risk of harm from an unleashed large dog charging a pedestrian is foreseeable, and Defendant’s conduct created a zone of danger that caused Plaintiff’s injuries. *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37, 44 (2009).  
27. A reasonable person exercising due care would have maintained physical control over the dog to prevent precisely the kind of incident that occurred. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006).  
28. Defendant’s negligence was the factual and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *S.C.M. Corp. v. Cox*, 409 Mass. 505, 511 (1991).  
29. Plaintiff’s decision to evade the dog was a natural and reasonable response to Defendant’s negligence. *Ryder v. Robinson*, 369 Mass. 174, 178 (1975) (stating that an actor is liable for harm that results from another’s foreseeable reaction to danger created by the actor’s negligence).  
30. The fact that the dog did not physically contact Plaintiff does not absolve Defendant of liability, as emotional and physical injuries sustained while reasonably avoiding danger caused by Defendant’s negligence are compensable. *Kosko v. Hines*, 201 Mass. 456, 458 (1909).  
31. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress. *See also* *Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000); *Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas*, 378 Mass. 85, 100 (1979); *McNamara v. Honeyman*, 406 Mass. 43, 45 (1989); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 341A (1965).

   a. Medical expenses of approximately $5,500;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $2,000;  
   c. Physical pain, mental anguish, and emotional distress;  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to perform in a piano recital; and  
   e. Other general and special damages in an amount to be determined at trial.  

33. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages actually sustained and allowed under Massachusetts law. *See* G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 85; *Brune v. Belinkoff*, 354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968).
