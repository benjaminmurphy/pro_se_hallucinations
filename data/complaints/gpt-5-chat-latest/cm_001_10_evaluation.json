It does not discuss the general standard for modification of custody based on changed circumstances affecting the child\u2019s welfare. The opinion focuses instead on the mother\u2019s right to relocate prior to adjudication of paternity and the inapplicability of removal jurisprudence such as Yannas, so it does not support the cited proposition about when a court may modify custody upon changed circumstances.",

The court holds that relocation and the temporary change in the custodial schedule (including any interaction with the parents\u2019 work situations) could not serve as the required material change. Thus, the case stands for the opposite of the claimed proposition, rather than finding a material change based on schedule/work conflicts.",

In the brief custody discussion, the court focuses on the children\u2019s best interests, the parents\u2019 insight into special needs, and the improper use of a motion instead of a complaint for modification; it does not articulate or prioritize a distinct doctrinal rule that stability and consistency of care override other factors.
