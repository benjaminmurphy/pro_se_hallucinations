The court affirms liability and damages based on repeated flooding that impaired the character and value of the premises, expressly tying the landlord\u2019s statutory and common-law quiet enjoyment obligations to maintaining watertight, sanitary conditions.

The court\u2019s reasoning focuses on landlord responsibility for noise and nuisance created by a commercial tenant and control over those conditions. It does not discuss water intrusion, housing code violations, or similar conditions, so citing it specifically for that aspect overstates its holding.",

It does not address water infiltration, habitability defects, or physical conditions of the premises as constituting serious interference. In fact, the court expressly limits the warranty of habitability to physical defects and treats quiet enjoyment separately, so using Doe as authority that failure to remedy water infiltration constitutes serious interference misstates the holding.",

While he agrees the old common-law \u2018no duty to repair\u2019 rule should be reconsidered, he does not ground the landlord\u2019s duty in a broad, judicially created implied warranty of habitability as the proposition states. Thus, this portion of Hemingway does not support the claim that the landlord\u2019s duty arises both under common law and an implied warranty of habitability recognized in this case; it instead critiques that approach.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe point at which I dissent from the opinion of the court is where it attempts to accomplish the first step by resort to an implied warranty of the fitness of the rented dwelling unit instead of by the implication of an agreement that the unit will comply with the minimum standards required therefor by law. The court states the new rule to be that the landlord renting a dwelling unit impliedly warrants to the tenant \u2018that the premises are fit for human occupation\u2026.\u2019 I dissent from the statement of such a broad and sweeping new rule\u2026.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion holds that liability under G.L. c. 186, \u00a714 requires at least negligent conduct and that a statutory violation alone is insufficient; it does not address or apply the statute\u2019s enhanced-damages \u2018willful and knowing\u2019 standard. The case focuses on whether strict liability under the lead paint statute automatically triggers \u00a714 remedies (including attorneys\u2019 fees) and concludes it does not, and therefore provides no authority that a landlord\u2019s inaction after notice warrants enhanced damages for willful and knowing disregard of tenant rights.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"
