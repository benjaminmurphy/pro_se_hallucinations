2. The Defendant, **Emily Carter**, upon information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and maintains a three‑unit residential rental property located at **45 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts**.

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, which grants the Superior Court jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.  

4. Venue is proper in Worcester County under **G.L. c. 223, § 1** because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts.  

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **February 7–10, 2023**, a snowstorm deposited significant snowfall on and around the Defendant’s property located at 45 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

6. The sidewalk abutting the property was the responsibility of the Defendant, as the owner and person in control of the premises, to maintain in a reasonably safe condition. See **M.G.L. c. 84, §§ 15–24**.  

7. After the snowstorm, Defendant partially shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply salt, sand, or any other de‑icing treatment.  

8. Over the following days, daylight melting and nighttime freezing created patches of ice within the shoveled path, rendering it unsafe and slippery.  

9. Tenants at the property texted and otherwise notified Defendant of the dangerous icing condition, including pictures of the accumulation. Defendant responded that “the sun will take care of it.”  

10. Defendant took no remedial action to treat, sand, salt, or otherwise mitigate the hazard despite having actual and constructive notice of the dangerous condition.  

11. On **February 10, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises delivering groceries to a tenant of the building.  

12. While traversing the sidewalk path leading to the tenant’s door, Plaintiff slipped on the sheet of ice and fell backward, landing hard on the lower back.  

13. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered injuries to the lower back, incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses, and sustained lost wages of approximately **$600** due to inability to work for approximately one week.  

14. Plaintiff continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limited mobility and has suffered and will continue to suffer physical and emotional distress.

#### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner owes lawful visitors and those reasonably expected to be present upon the premises a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).  

17. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful visitor engaged in ordinary business at the premises, a duty of reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk abutting 45 Maple Street.  

18. Defendant had both actual and constructive notice of the icy sidewalk and failed to take reasonable measures to correct or warn of the hazard, in violation of her duty of care. See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 435 Mass. 353 (2001).  

19. Defendant’s failure to sand, salt, or adequately clear the walkway constitutes negligence under Massachusetts common law. See also **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988).  

20. Defendant’s failure to act was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. See **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401 (1991); **Janosz v. J.C. Penney Co.**, 324 Mass. 697 (1949).  

21. Plaintiff’s injury was a foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of duty, and Plaintiff exercised reasonable care at all times relevant. See **Barry v. Beverly Enterprises‑Mass., Inc.**, 418 Mass. 590 (1994); **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000).  

22. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained personal injuries, pain and suffering, lost wages, and medical expenses, and will continue to sustain such damages into the future. See **G.L. c. 231, § 6D** (governing recovery of damages for personal injury).

#### V. DAMAGES

23. Plaintiff seeks recovery of all compensable damages allowed by Massachusetts law, including:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately **$2,500**;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately **$600**;  
   c. Reasonable compensation for pain and suffering;  
   d. Costs of suit and applicable interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C**; and  
   e. Any further relief deemed just and proper by the Court.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jordan Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
