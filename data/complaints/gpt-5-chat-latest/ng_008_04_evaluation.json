The court reverses the jury verdict and orders judgment for the defendant, explicitly concluding that the circumstantial evidence did not establish that the substance was present long enough for the defendant\u2019s employees to have actual or constructive knowledge.

In abolishing the natural/unnatural accumulation distinction, the court emphasizes the general duty to protect lawful visitors from known or reasonably knowable dangers like snow and ice on walkways and parking lots, which aligns with the notion that such harms are foreseeably associated with wet/icy surfaces.",

However, the Court ultimately remands rather than definitively holding that Roche Bros. in fact acted unreasonably on the facts, so the case is authority for the legal principle, not for a factual finding of breach in this instance.",

The opinion does not affirm that, in this case, the defendant\u2019s negligence directly and proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 personal injuries, pain and suffering, medical expenses, or lost income; it concludes the opposite. Therefore, it does not support the specific causation-and-damages proposition asserted.",
