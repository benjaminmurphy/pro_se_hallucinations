Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant.  

Docket No. __________  

---

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, *Emily Johnson*, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A, and 37, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the equitable powers of this Honorable Court. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, **Liam Smith**, age 10, and **Ava Smith**, age 8.  

2. The Defendant, **Michael Smith**, is the father of the minor children and resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6 and G.L. c. 208, § 28A, as both parties and the minor children reside within the Commonwealth.

---

### **II. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR JUDGMENT**

4. On **May 14, 2021**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan** providing that the parties share **joint legal custody** of the minor children.  

5. Pursuant to that Judgment, the children **reside primarily with the Plaintiff**, with the Defendant exercising parenting time on a regular, structured schedule.  

6. The Judgment obligates both parties to promote the children’s relationship with the other parent and to refrain from making disparaging remarks about the other parent in the presence of the children.  

---

### **III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since the entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor children.  

8. Over the past year, the Defendant has **enrolled the children in extracurricular activities** scheduled during the Plaintiff’s court-ordered parenting time without prior consultation or agreement, contrary to the shared legal custody provisions and the spirit of cooperation required by the prior order.  

9. The Defendant has repeatedly told the children that it is the **Plaintiff’s fault** when they are unable to attend such activities while in her care and custody.  

10. The minor children have reported to the Plaintiff that their father describes the Plaintiff in **negative and disparaging terms**, including calling her “selfish” and suggesting that she “does not really love them” when she requests to adjust the visitation schedule.  

11. As a result of these conflicts, one of the children has begun experiencing **somatic symptoms** such as stomach aches and anxiety on transition days between homes.  

12. These developments demonstrate a **breakdown in co-parenting communication** and a **detrimental impact** on the children’s emotional wellbeing.  

13. The pattern of unilateral decision-making regarding the children’s activities and persistent disparagement constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the prior judgment, warranting modification.   

---

### **IV. LEGAL STANDARD**

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody or parenting order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that the proposed modification serves the **best interests of the children**.  

15. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all determinations of custody and parenting arrangements.  *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

16. Relevant statutory authority includes:  
   - **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A** (custody orders and modification standards);  
   - **G.L. c. 215, § 6** (probate and family court jurisdiction);  
   - **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** (modification of judgments regarding minor children born out of wedlock); and  
   - **G.L. c. 208, § 37** (equitable powers of the Probate and Family Court).  

17. Massachusetts courts have recognized that significant **interference with a child’s relationship with the other parent** or failure to cooperate in joint decision-making may constitute a sufficient “material change.”  *See* **Rosen v. Rosen**, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Pappas v. Pappas**, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 240 (2008); **Miller v. Miller**, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 989 (1986).  

18. The Court may further consider the **emotional well-being of the children** and patterns of **parental conduct that erode stability or trust** as bases for modification.  *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); **Helms v. Helms**, 392 Mass. 660 (1984).  

19. The Plaintiff’s requested modification complies with these authorities and promotes the minor children’s health, stability, and continued meaningful relationships with both parents.  

---

### **V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

20. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court **modify the existing custody order** to reflect the following:  

   a. That **Emily Johnson** be granted **sole legal and physical custody** of the minor children, **Liam Smith** and **Ava Smith**;  

   b. That **Michael Smith’s parenting time** be continued on a schedule ensuring meaningful contact with the children, but that all **extracurricular and scheduling decisions** be made with the Plaintiff’s consent or after prior written consultation;  

   c. That the Judgment include a clear provision **prohibiting disparagement** of either parent before the children and requiring both parties to foster positivity regarding the other parent’s role; and  

   d. That the Court include such additional orders as may be necessary to **protect the children’s emotional welfare**, ensure **cooperative communication**, and reduce conflict during transitions.  

---

### **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, *Emily Johnson*, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the custody order dated **May 14, 2021**;  
2. Modify said Judgment to award **sole legal and physical custody** of the minor children to the Plaintiff;  
3. Establish a revised parenting plan as set forth above;  
4. Order that all major decisions regarding the children’s education, health, and activities be made by the Plaintiff after good-faith consultation with the Defendant; and  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the children.
