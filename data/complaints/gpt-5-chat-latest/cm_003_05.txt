### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, *Sarah Johnson* (“Plaintiff”), pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6, and Rule 15 of the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to **modify the existing judgment of custody entered on October 15, 2021**, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances adversely affecting the best interests of the minor child, *Ethan Johnson* (age 10).  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:**  
   Name: **Sarah Johnson**  
   Residence: Bristol County, Massachusetts  
   Telephone: (617) 555-0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:**  
   Name: **Michael Smith**  
   Residence: Bristol County, Massachusetts  

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child **Ethan Johnson**, born [date withheld for privacy], age 10.

---

### II. PRIOR COURT ORDER

4. On **October 15, 2021**, this Honorable Court entered a Judgment establishing shared legal custody of Ethan, granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody and the Defendant parenting time on alternating weekends.  
5. At that time, the Court found that both parties were fit parents and capable of cooperative co‑parenting, and that the arrangement served the best interests of the minor child.  

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. Since entry of the prior Judgment, the Defendant’s circumstances have materially changed within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28, creating a risk to Ethan’s health, safety, and welfare.  
7. Specifically, the Defendant has, on multiple occasions, appeared to be intoxicated or otherwise impaired while caring for the child.  
8. The child has reported that his father consumes “special drinks” and “can’t walk straight.”  
9. A neighbor has provided Plaintiff with a video depicting the Defendant stumbling and having difficulty walking while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night.  
10. Ethan’s school has reported that he frequently arrives on Monday mornings exhausted and inattentive after weekends with his father, which was not previously the case.  
11. Plaintiff is gravely concerned for the child’s safety and well‑being during overnights with Defendant.  
12. These facts represent a substantial and material change in circumstances that could not have been anticipated by the Court at the time of the original Judgment.  

---

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITIES

13. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a judgment concerning custody when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the child.  
14. The “best interests of the child” standard is paramount and guides all custody determinations. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).  
15. A material change exists where the circumstances upon which the earlier judgment was based no longer reflect the present reality or threaten the child’s welfare. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981).  
16. The Court has a continuing duty to safeguard a child’s welfare where new conditions render the prior order inconsistent with the child’s best interests. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 599 (1996).  
17. Evidence of parental substance abuse and failure to provide a stable environment has repeatedly been found sufficient to warrant modification. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 841 (2003); *Adoption of Quentin*, 424 Mass. 882, 888 (1997).  
18. The Court may impose conditions or limitations such as supervised visits when necessary to protect the child while maintaining parental contact. *Custody of Victoria*, 473 Mass. 64, 72 (2015); *Custody of Eleanor*, 414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993).  
19. The doctrine permitting modification applies equally to shared legal custody where communication breakdown or parental unfitness undermines the child’s welfare. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006).  
20. The Court’s discretion to modify is also supported by *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981), *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986), and *Care and Protection of Benjamin*, 403 Mass. 24 (1988), all recognizing the primacy of child safety and the need for prompt modification when material risk arises.

### V. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff **Sarah Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the October 15, 2021 Judgment;  
2. Determine that **modification of custody and visitation** is in the best interests of the minor child, *Ethan Johnson*;  
3. Modify the current custody order to provide:  
   a. That the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by an approved third party or a supervised visitation center until further order of the Court;  
   b. Alternatively, that the Defendant’s visitation be conditioned on proof of sobriety and completion of an appropriate substance‑abuse evaluation and treatment program;  
   c. That the Plaintiff continue to have primary physical and legal custody during the pendency of this matter; and  
   d. Any other order this Honorable Court deems just and proper to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the child.
