Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Mark Reynolds,**  
Defendant.

**CIVIL ACTION NO. ________**

---

# **COMPLAINT**

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Mark Reynolds (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Ashmont Street, Apartment 2, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  
2. Defendant Mark Reynolds is an individual with a principal address for service believed to be [Defendant’s business or residential address], and at all times relevant hereto was the landlord and owner of the building located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as the property and events giving rise to this claim are located in Dorchester, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3)** and **G.L. c. 223, § 7**, because the premises that are the subject of this dispute are located in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

---

## **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant for a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).  
6. The agreed rent under the tenancy was $1,800 per month.  
7. Defendant, as the landlord, had a duty under Massachusetts law to maintain the premises in habitable condition, including providing heat sufficient to meet the requirements of the **State Sanitary Code, G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L**, and **105 C.M.R. § 410.201**, which requires that every dwelling be capable of maintaining a minimum temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.  
8. During the winter months of 2024–2025, the heating system in the Premises repeatedly malfunctioned. While it did not fail completely, the temperature commonly dropped to approximately 60 degrees for several hours during the evenings.  
9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the problem. Defendant sent repair personnel twice, but the problem persisted after each repair.  
10. The second repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional,” and that there was little more to be done.  
11. The problem recurred throughout the winter, leaving the apartment uncomfortably and unlawfully cold.  
12. Plaintiff was forced to purchase two electric space heaters to keep the unit livable, at a cost of approximately $150 per month in increased electricity bills.  
13. Plaintiff developed bronchitis in January 2025, which her physician indicated was likely aggravated by the cold indoor temperatures. Plaintiff missed three days of work and had to purchase medication.  
14. Despite repeated notice of these issues, Defendant failed to provide adequate and consistent heat.  
15. Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to, the increased cost of utilities, inconvenience, discomfort, and illness caused by Defendant’s failure to provide habitable and lawful heat levels.  
16. The ongoing heating deficiencies substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises.

## **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
### **Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**)

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  
18. Defendant, by failing to provide adequate and lawful heat levels, and by failing to make effective and lasting repairs after notice from Plaintiff, substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment, and a landlord’s failure to maintain essential services—including heat—after notice constitutes such interference.  
20. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that inadequate heat, water, or other sanitary conditions can constitute a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 99–101 (1982); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994); **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
21. It is not necessary for the landlord’s interference to be intentional; negligence or inaction after notice can be sufficient. **Simon v. Solomon**, supra; **Hemingway v. Perini**, 363 Mass. 180, 185–86 (1973).  
22. Defendant’s ongoing failure to ensure adequate heat after repeated notice from Plaintiff constitutes interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  
23. Defendant’s failure also violates the minimum habitability requirements of the **Massachusetts State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. § 410.201**, as enforced under **G.L. c. 111, § 127L**, and such violations constitute evidence of a breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 198–99 (1979).  
24. A landlord’s failure to provide functioning heat, where the tenant experiences ongoing discomfort or incurs extra expense to maintain a livable environment, amounts to constructive interference with quiet enjoyment. **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. at 198–200; **Al-Ziab**, 424 Mass. at 851.  
25. Plaintiff, therefore, has been deprived of the beneficial use of her dwelling, entitling her to damages, attorney’s fees, and costs under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

---

## **V. DAMAGES**

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:  
   a. Approximately $600 in increased electric bills and related costs;  
   b. Illness, medical expenses, and lost wages associated with bronchitis;  
   c. Emotional distress, discomfort, and inconvenience; and  
   d. The loss of quiet enjoyment of her home during the winter months.  
27. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the greater of actual damages or three months’ rent, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

---

## **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Reynolds as follows:

A. Declaring that Defendant has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Awarding Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of **$600** or, in the alternative, **three months’ rent ($5,400)**, whichever is greater, as provided by statute;  
C. Awarding reasonable costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**;  
D. Awarding interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6C**; and  
E. Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

## **VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025**.
