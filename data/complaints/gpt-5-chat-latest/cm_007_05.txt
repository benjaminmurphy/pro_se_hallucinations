**JESSICA TURNER,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL TURNER,**  
Defendant.  

---

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

---

### I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, respectfully brings this Complaint pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209, § 37**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, seeking modification of an existing custody order entered by this Court on **May 15, 2018**.

2. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter as the original **Custody Judgment** was issued by the Berkshire Probate and Family Court.

3. Plaintiff seeks a modification of custody based upon a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the best interests of the minor child, **Emily Turner (age 12)**.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. The Judgment of May 15, 2018 established shared legal and shared physical custody of the parties’ minor child, with a **50/50 week-on/week-off schedule**.

5. At the time of the original judgment, both parents were in good health, resided in close proximity, and the shared custody arrangement operated effectively for several years.

6. The Defendant, **Michael Turner**, has since been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that affects his mobility and ability to care for the minor child safely and independently.

7. Defendant’s condition includes frequent falls and limitations on physical coordination. His treating physician has advised that he **should not be alone with the child in situations involving stairs or physical assistance**.

8. Despite these medical limitations, Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the full 50/50 physical custody schedule.

9. On numerous occasions, Defendant has relied upon the child, **Emily Turner**, to assist him in basic caregiving tasks, such as helping transfer him between a wheelchair and bed and obtaining items out of his reach.

10. The child has expressed anxiety and emotional strain about being placed in situations where she feels responsible for her father’s physical safety.

11. Plaintiff respectfully submits that continuing the current 50/50 custody schedule poses safety and emotional concerns for the minor child and now conflicts with her **best interests** as defined by **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31**.

12. Plaintiff proposes that the parenting schedule be modified so that the child have **primary physical custody** with Plaintiff, with Defendant to have frequent and meaningful parenting time consistent with his health and safety limitations, including supervised or shorter visits as medically recommended.

13. The proposed modification is not punitive but is necessary to protect the child’s welfare while preserving her relationship with both parents.

---

### III. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

14. Under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, a custody or parenting order may be modified if there has been a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties or the child and if such modification is necessary in the child’s **best interests**.  

15. The law is well established that the **best interests of the child** standard governs all custody determinations. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

16. Substantial changes in a parent’s health or ability to provide safe care constitute grounds for modification. *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

17. Courts have repeatedly held that when changed circumstances render an existing schedule impracticable or detrimental, modification may be warranted. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Williams v. Massa**, 431 Mass. 619, 625 (2000).

18. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, both parents share equally in parental rights and responsibilities, but the court must consider the capacity of each parent to provide the child’s needs and welfare.

19. Cases interpreting this standard emphasize safety and stability. *See* **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219, 227 (1998); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

20. A modification is appropriate where enforcement of the current order would endanger the child’s welfare. *See* **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871 (2006).

21. To further support this Petition, Plaintiff invokes the Court’s equitable authority under **G.L. c. 215, § 6** allowing modification of judgments concerning custody when equitable circumstances require.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

22. The Defendant’s newly diagnosed and progressively debilitating neurological condition constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** unforeseen at the time of the 2018 custody order.

23. Defendant’s decreased mobility and risk of falls significantly limit his ability to provide independent care and supervision for a twelve-year-old child in a two-story residence.

24. As a result, the child is increasingly called upon to serve as a caregiver, jeopardizing her emotional well-being and safety.

25. The original 50/50 custody arrangement is therefore no longer **practicable, safe, or consistent with the child’s best interests**.

---

### V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor child since the entry of the original custody order dated May 15, 2018;

B. Modify the existing order to grant the Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the minor child, **Emily Turner**, with **shared legal custody** continuing unless otherwise determined appropriate by the Court;

C. Establish a parenting schedule granting the Defendant **reasonable and flexible parenting time** consistent with his medical condition and the child’s best interests, which may include short visits, daytime contact, or supervised parenting time if necessary;

D. Order such additional provisions as necessary for the child’s safety and continuing relationship with both parents;

E. Grant such other relief as the Court deems **just and proper**.
