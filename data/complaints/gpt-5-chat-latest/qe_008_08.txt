#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant to lease an apartment at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, MA, for $1,500 per month.  
7. Plaintiff has paid all rent due under said agreement and has complied with all terms of the tenancy.  
8. The building’s main entry door has a defective and broken lock that does not latch properly, allowing unauthorized persons to enter the building without a key.  
9. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the broken front entry lock approximately two months prior to the filing of this complaint.  
10. Despite multiple written and verbal requests—at least three over the ensuing two months—Defendant has failed and refused to repair or replace the lock.  
11. In or about **November 2025**, an unauthorized person entered the building and rifled through residents’ mail, causing the theft of Plaintiff’s package valued at approximately **$120.00**.  
12. Subsequent to that incident, Plaintiff discovered evidence suggesting that an unknown person had been sleeping in the building’s basement.  
13. Out of concern for safety and security, Plaintiff purchased a personal video camera and upgraded her apartment’s deadbolt at a cost of approximately **$200.00**.  
14. Defendant trivialized Plaintiff’s concerns and failed to take reasonable steps to secure the building common areas or repair the main door lock.  
15. Defendant’s failure to maintain secure and habitable premises has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the property, causing distress, inconvenience, expense, and loss of personal property.  
16. Plaintiff estimates total damages of approximately **$320.00** (for stolen property and security-related expenses), plus statutory damages as permitted by law.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, every tenancy includes an implied **covenant of quiet enjoyment**, meaning that the tenant shall not be disturbed in her possession by the landlord or by conditions caused or permitted by the landlord. See **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
19. Defendant knowingly failed to repair the defective entryway lock after repeated notice, thereby allowing continuing unauthorized access to the property, mail theft, and security threats, effectively depriving Plaintiff and other tenants of the ability to peacefully and securely enjoy the premises.  
20. Such failure constitutes a willful or negligent act or omission by the landlord that interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See **Alglow Realty Corp. v. Cent. Appraisal Co., 379 Mass. 495 (1980)**; **Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**.  
21. The acts and omissions of Defendant amount to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which provides for actual and consequential damages or **three months’ rent, whichever is greater**.  
22. Defendant’s conduct is analogous to that found to violate quiet enjoyment in **Faford v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc., 439 Mass. 512 (2003)** (landlord’s failure to remedy conditions interfering with access), **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)** (psychological distress actionable under covenant of quiet enjoyment), and **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)** (landlord responsible for conditions substantially interfering with tenants’ use and enjoyment).  
23. Defendant’s failure to maintain secure common areas and repair the entrance lock constitutes a defect in common areas under **G.L. c. 186, § 15**, which must be kept in a reasonably safe condition. See also **Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)**.  
24. The unauthorized intrusions and theft resulting from Defendant’s inaction directly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment. See also **Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929)**; **Whinery v. Robbins, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 343 (1983)**; **Rich v. Ellerman, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 1037 (1980)**.  
25. Defendant’s conduct also violated his duty under **G.L. c. 93A, § 2** and **940 C.M.R. § 3.17(6)** to maintain the premises in compliance with applicable landlord-tenant obligations, further evidencing negligent disregard for tenant safety (though Plaintiff asserts no separate statutory count herein).  
26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered injury, distress, loss of property, and incurred additional expenses to secure the premises.
