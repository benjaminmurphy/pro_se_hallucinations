v.  
**JAMES SULLIVAN,**  
Defendant.  
---
Civil Action No. ___________

---

### COMPLAINT  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)**

---

#### I. PARTIES
1. The Plaintiff, **Carla Martinez** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  
2. The Defendant, **James Sullivan** (“Defendant”), is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §3 and G.L. c. 212, §4, as this action arises out of a landlord-tenant relationship within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Boston Housing Court Department.  
4. Venue in Suffolk County is proper because the leased premises are located within Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood of Boston, and all acts and omissions complained of occurred in this County.

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. On or about **February 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease with Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at **123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts**, for a monthly rent of **$1,500**.  
6. During the initial showing of the apartment, Plaintiff observed visible **water stains on the ceiling** and specifically asked the Defendant about them. Defendant represented that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”  
7. Relying on that representation, Plaintiff entered into the lease and took occupancy.  
8. Shortly thereafter, during the first **significant rainstorm**, water began **dripping through the same section of the ceiling**.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak and requested repairs. Defendant repeatedly responded that the issue was “minor” and merely a “cosmetic” flaw.  
10. The water infiltration progressively worsened over subsequent months. During one heavy rainstorm, the leak **soaked Plaintiff’s couch** and **damaged a laptop** left on her coffee table, resulting in approximately **$900** in property damage.  
11. Despite repeated complaints, Defendant failed and refused to make proper repairs.  
12. The ongoing water intrusion has produced **a persistent musty odor** and apparent **mold growth**, causing Plaintiff to suffer **headaches** and to move her bed away from the affected area.  
13. Plaintiff has thereby been deprived of the **use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of her dwelling**, effectively confining her living space to half the apartment.  
14. Defendant’s continuing failure to maintain the premises in habitable condition and to correct the leak, despite notice and opportunity, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s **quiet enjoyment** of the premises.  
15. As a direct result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to (a) loss of use of substantial portions of the unit; (b) property damage of approximately $900; (c) emotional distress, inconvenience, and health-related symptoms; and (d) loss of the benefit of the bargain under the lease. Plaintiff seeks **$1,000 in damages**.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. The statute provides that a landlord who does so “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.”  
18. The **covenant of quiet enjoyment** is implicit in every residential tenancy, protecting tenants against acts or omissions that substantially impair their beneficial use of the leased premises. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).  
19. Persistent water leaks, failure to repair material defects, and resulting mold or uninhabitable conditions have repeatedly been found to constitute violations of this covenant. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 200 (1979); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977).  
20. Defendant had **actual notice** of the leak condition and its worsening state yet failed to take timely and adequate steps to repair it, in violation of statutory and common-law obligations under **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, **G.L. c. 186, §§14 and 15F**, and the Massachusetts **State Sanitary Code**, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.  
21. Such omissions constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and quiet enjoyment, similar to the violations recognized in *Sargent v. Fuller*, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 909 (1999) (sustained interference through landlord’s inaction); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982) (constructive eviction through repeated flooding and failure to repair); *Winchester v. McCue*, 385 Mass. 144, 147 (1982) (chronic leaks and disrepair amounted to breach); and *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (water leaks and mold held actionable).  
22. Defendant’s conduct also violates the **implied warranty of habitability**, which informs the extent of interference actionable under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 200 (1973); *Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 (2004).  
23. Defendant’s refusal to address health and safety hazards contravenes **G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127H**, requiring landlords to maintain premises in compliance with the sanitary code.  
24. Plaintiff’s repeated written and verbal complaints were ignored, demonstrating deliberate or reckless disregard for her right to quiet enjoyment. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 789 (1994).  
25. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual and consequential damages**, or alternatively **three months’ rent ($4,500)**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
26. Defendant’s acts and omissions were willful, wanton, and in bad faith, justifying imposition of statutory damages and full relief under Massachusetts law.

C. Award Plaintiff reimbursement for property damage in the amount of **$900**, plus consequential damages for inconvenience and distress;
