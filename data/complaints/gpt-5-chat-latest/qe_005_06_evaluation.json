Although the core issue is lead paint, the court\u2019s description of quiet enjoyment liability clearly endorses the principle that failure to respond to repeated complaints and to take available corrective measures can constitute unreasonable and substantial interference. Thus, the case supports using \u00a7 14 where a landlord fails to act after repeated complaints.",

In Haddad v. Gonzalez, the court discusses breach of the implied warranty of habitability, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and Chapter 93A, but it does not analyze or set out the standard for \u2018unreasonable and substantial interference\u2019 under the covenant of quiet enjoyment in any detail. The opinion affirms judgment on a quiet enjoyment counterclaim but focuses its legal analysis elsewhere, so it is not clear authority for the specific proposition stated.",

To avoid awarding cumulative damages, however, the judge dismissed all but the retaliation and c. 93A counterclaims."
