---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **June 15, 2023**, at approximately 8:15 a.m., Plaintiff was riding a bicycle eastbound in the marked bicycle lane along **Commonwealth Avenue**, near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02134.  
6. Plaintiff was lawfully operating his bicycle, following all traffic regulations, wearing a protective helmet, and maintaining due care.  
7. At the same time and location, Defendant had parked or stopped a vehicle adjacent to the bike lane in a designated loading zone.  
8. Without warning, Defendant opened the driver’s side door directly into the marked bicycle lane without checking for approaching cyclists or otherwise ascertaining that it was safe to do so.  
9. Plaintiff, who had no opportunity to avoid the collision, struck the open door and was thrown to the pavement.  
10. As a direct result, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries including road rash to his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bicycle, including a bent frame.  
11. At the scene, Defendant stated that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone.  
12. Defendant later made inconsistent statements to his insurer, alleging falsely that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”  
13. Plaintiff incurred medical and dental expenses of approximately **$1,500**, property losses for the damaged bicycle, and approximately **$800** in lost wages due to missed work.  
14. Plaintiff has experienced pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of normal daily activities as a result of Defendant’s negligence.  
15. Plaintiff duly complied with applicable notice requirements, and this suit is timely filed under **G.L. c. 260, § 2A** (three-year statute of limitations for tort actions).

### IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Defendant owed a duty of care under Massachusetts law to operate and exit his vehicle in a reasonably safe manner and to refrain from actions that would foreseeably endanger other lawful users of the road, including bicyclists.  
18. The duty arises under common law and statutes including **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, which specifically prohibits a person from opening the door of a motor vehicle unless it can be done safely and without interfering with traffic.  
19. Defendant breached his duty by failing to look for approaching bicyclists prior to opening his door, by being distracted by his phone, and by opening his door directly into the path of Plaintiff’s bicycle.  
20. Defendant’s actions constitute negligence as defined under Massachusetts law, including **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 282**, and by cases such as *Glenn v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co.*, 208 Mass. 442 (1911) (defining actionable negligence as failure to exercise care of an ordinarily prudent person).  
21. Defendant’s conduct violated the reasonable standard of care and foreseeably created a risk of harm to others lawfully using the roadway.  
22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained actual injuries and damages.

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITY

23. Massachusetts recognizes a duty owed by motorists to exercise due care toward bicyclists (*Delano v. Garrettson*, 351 Mass. 779 (1967); *Hubbard v. Palmer Russell Co.*, 343 Mass. 414 (1961)).  
24. “Dooring” incidents are addressed in cases and codes affirming that failure to check before opening a vehicle door constitutes actionable negligence (*Gross v. Republic Taxi Serv., Inc.*, 2016 Mass. App. Div. 105 (2016)).  
25. Under *Issacson v. Boston*, 241 Mass. 477 (1922), and *Hook v. Springfield Street Ry. Co.*, 215 Mass. 436 (1913), negligence may be found where a defendant fails to maintain proper lookout or performs an act foreseeably dangerous to others.  
26. Massachusetts adheres to the principles of comparative negligence under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, but Plaintiff was at all times using due care and any alleged contributory negligence was less than that of Defendant.  
27. Plaintiff’s recovery of medical expenses and property loss is authorized by **G.L. c. 231, § 6D**, and his damages for suffering and losses are recoverable under common-law negligence principles.  
28. The following authorities establish the elements of negligence in Massachusetts and apply to this case:  
  (a) *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty arising from foreseeable risk);  
  (b) *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37 (2009) (breach and causation);  
  (c) *Zieminski v. Kenney*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 228 (1985) (proximate cause);  
  (d) *Cottrell v. N.H. Ins. Co.*, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 164 (2012) (foreseeability and standard of care);  
  (e) *G.L. c. 90, § 14* (door-opening safety statute);  
  (f) *G.L. c. 231, § 85* (comparative negligence);  
  (g) *G.L. c. 260, § 2A* (limitations period);  
  (h) *Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283* (reasonable person standard);  
  (i) *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (foreseeability and duty);  
  (j) *Glenn v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co.*, 208 Mass. 442 (1911) (definition of negligence).  
29. Under these authorities, Defendant is liable for Plaintiff’s injuries because his failure to exercise due care in opening his vehicle door directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s damages.

### VI. DAMAGES

30. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
  (a) Physical pain and suffering, and bodily injury;  
  (b) Emotional distress and interference with normal activities;  
  (c) Medical and dental expenses of approximately **$1,500**;  
  (d) Lost wages of approximately **$800**;  
  (e) Property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle and equipment;

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;  
B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed **$25,000**;  
C. Award costs pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)** and statutory interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;
