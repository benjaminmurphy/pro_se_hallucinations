### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)*

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff **Jordan Smith** (“Plaintiff”) resides at 24 Chelsea Street, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, where he is a lawful residential tenant pursuant to a written or oral rental agreement entered into on or about June 1, 2022.

2. Defendant **Emily Johnson** (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 24 Chelsea Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”).

3. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000, and therefore this Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19 and G.L. c. 185C, §3.

4. Venue is proper in the **Chelsea Division of the District Court Department**, as the property is located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy at the Premises on or about June 1, 2022, paying monthly rent in the amount of **$1,500**.

6. The main entry door to the building has a broken lock that does not latch properly, allowing unauthorized persons to push the door open at any time.

7. Beginning approximately **two months prior to the filing of this Complaint**, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the defective lock and requested that it be promptly repaired.

8. Defendant acknowledged the problem and represented that it would be fixed, but despite at least **three separate reminders**, Defendant failed to complete or arrange any repair.

9. In the absence of adequate security, unauthorized persons have **entered the building**, rummaged through residents’ mail, and **stolen packages**, including one belonging to Plaintiff valued at **approximately $120**.

10. Plaintiff has also discovered evidence suggesting that strangers have been **sleeping in the basement** of the building, further compromising the safety and habitability of the Premises.

11. As a result of Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses of approximately **$200** to purchase an additional deadbolt and security camera for his apartment door.

12. On multiple occasions, Plaintiff informed Defendant of these continuing problems. Defendant responded that Plaintiff was “overreacting” and took no further action to secure the premises.

13. Defendant’s inaction constitutes an **interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** of his tenancy, in violation of Massachusetts law, by substantially impairing Plaintiff’s right to peaceful and secure possession of the Premises.

14. Plaintiff has suffered substantial **stress, inconvenience, loss of property, and expenses** as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the building in a reasonably secure condition.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14**

15. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of a residential tenant’s premises and is liable for damages if the tenant’s enjoyment is disturbed by circumstances for which the landlord is responsible or about which the landlord unreasonably fails to act.

17. The defective entry door lock and Defendant’s failure to timely correct the condition constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, depriving Plaintiff of safety and security in his home.

18. A landlord’s failure to repair known security defects can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See e.g., Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (failure to repair conditions affecting safety and livability held to violate quiet enjoyment); *Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 378 Mass. 758 (1979) (landlord liable for interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment from unremedied conditions); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (quiet enjoyment breached by substantial interference even without intent).

19. Other cases affirming a landlord’s duty to maintain premises free from dangerous or disruptive conditions include *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Hemingway v. Brennan*, 326 Mass. 556 (1950); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005); and *Kelley v. LaForce*, 288 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002) (interpreting Massachusetts law).

20. Defendant had actual knowledge of the defective lock for at least two months prior to the thefts and unauthorized entries and negligently or willfully failed to remedy the defect.

21. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a reasonably secure condition represents a direct breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

22. Pursuant to that statute, a tenant who suffers such interference is entitled to recover **actual and consequential damages**, and where the violation is willful, **three months’ rent or three times the actual damages**, whichever is greater, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

23. Plaintiff’s actual financial losses include approximately **$120** for stolen property and **$200** in costs for replacement locks and a security camera, totaling **$320**, exclusive of statutory damages and fees.

24. Defendant’s disregard of repeated repair requests was willful or at least reckless, entitling Plaintiff to **treble damages** and attorney’s fees under G.L. c. 186, §14.

### IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jordan Smith** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and declare that Defendant **Emily Johnson** breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;
