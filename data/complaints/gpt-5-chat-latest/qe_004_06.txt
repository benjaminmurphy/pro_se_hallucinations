### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)

**Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”),** brings this action against **Defendant, Michael Williams (“Defendant”),** and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.  

2. Defendant Michael Williams is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in or conducts business in Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 (“the Premises”).

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19, as this action involves a civil claim for damages arising in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  

4. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court as the Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Worcester, Massachusetts.  

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to lease a residential apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

6. Plaintiff has consistently paid monthly rent of $1,200 and has otherwise complied with all lease obligations.  

7. Beginning in or around September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings throughout her kitchen.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation. Defendant responded by placing a few traps in the apartment.  

9. Although two or more mice were caught, the infestation persisted, and Plaintiff continued to find droppings on a weekly basis.  

10. Defendant hired an exterminator for a single visit. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building required more comprehensive pest treatment.  

11. Defendant refused to authorize further extermination efforts, stating that extensive treatment was “overkill” and “too expensive,” and that such conditions were “normal for older buildings.”  

12. As a result of Defendant’s failure to adequately remedy the pest infestation, Plaintiff has been deprived of the quiet enjoyment of her home, has suffered anxiety about cooking and eating in her own kitchen, and has been forced to dispose of contaminated food and purchase additional storage materials.  

13. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $280 in direct damages, including approximately $200 in discarded food and $80 for pest-proof storage containers.  

14. Despite repeated notice, Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable steps to restore habitability and to ensure the quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–14 above as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. G.L. c. 186, §14.  

17. Defendant’s actions and omissions, including failing to maintain the Premises free from rodent infestation, violated this covenant.  

18. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her dwelling. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–717 (1977) (landlord liable when conduct or inaction substantially interferes with tenant’s use and enjoyment).  

19. Persistent rodent infestation constitutes a substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and a violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. §410.550, which requires a landlord to maintain the premises free from rodent infestation. See also *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 871 (1991); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1987).  

20. Defendant’s failure to abate the infestation after notice violated G.L. c. 239, §8A and constitutes a retaliatory and negligent failure to maintain habitable conditions. See *Lipsitt v. Plaud*, 466 Mass. 240, 246–247 (2013); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 200 (1979).  

21. Massachusetts recognizes that a tenant need not vacate the premises to sustain a claim under G.L. c. 186, §14. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).  

22. Defendant’s conduct also constitutes a violation of the implied warranty of habitability, as interpreted in *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 200 (1973), which supports and informs the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

23. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover actual damages and costs under G.L. c. 186, §14, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees should counsel later appear. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–851 (1997).  

24. The landlord’s failure to maintain the Premises rodent-free also violates his duty under G.L. c. 111, §127A, which mandates compliance with the State Sanitary Code. Consistent with *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 101 (1982), emotional distress and inconvenience damages are recoverable for breach of quiet enjoyment.  

---

## V. DAMAGES

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses totaling approximately $280.  

26. Plaintiff has further suffered anxiety, emotional distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.  

27. Plaintiff seeks statutory damages, which under G.L. c. 186, §14 may include actual and consequential losses, as well as multiple damages if the interference was willful.  

---

## VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $280, or such other amount as determined at trial;  
B. Statutory damages and multiple damages as permitted under G.L. c. 186, §14;  
C. Costs of this action;  
D. Reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14 (to be determined if counsel appears); and  
E. Such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
