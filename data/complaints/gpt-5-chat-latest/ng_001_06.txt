#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 12, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s grocery store located at 150 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

6. Plaintiff was shopping in the dairy aisle, a location routinely used by customers and employees.  

7. As Plaintiff proceeded down the aisle, she stepped into a visible puddle of spilled milk and slipped, falling directly onto her right hip.  

8. The spill was large enough that grocery cart tracks were visible through it, demonstrating that the condition had existed for a noticeable period before Plaintiff’s fall.  

9. No warning signs, “wet floor” cones, or other safety precautions were in place at the time of the incident.  

10. A store employee was stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet from the spill and, after the incident, informed Plaintiff that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but chose to continue stocking before retrieving cleaning supplies.  

11. Defendant owed a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees, including promptly cleaning or warning of known hazards such as spilled liquids.  

12. Defendant breached this duty by failing to remove or warn of the spill after actual or constructive notice.  

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a **hip sprain**, resulting in pain, medical treatment, and lost wages.  

14. Plaintiff sought medical evaluation at an urgent care center the next day and was prescribed physical therapy.  

15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500 in medical expenses** and **$1,200 in lost wages** due to missed shifts at her café job.  

16. Plaintiff has endured and continues to endure pain, discomfort, and physical limitations since the fall.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts law, an owner or occupier of land owes lawful visitors a duty to maintain reasonably safe premises and to remedy or warn of hazards that the owner knows or should know of through reasonable care.  *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**; **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**.  

19. Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition—namely, the spilled milk—yet failed to act within a reasonable time to remove or warn of it.  *See* **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165 (1973)** (duty where condition existed for sufficient time to be discovered through reasonable care).  

20. Defendant, through its employee, expressly admitted knowledge of the spill existing before Plaintiff’s fall, evidencing actual notice and a failure to take remedial action.  

21. Defendant’s breach of duty constitutes negligence under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which imposes liability for damages proximately resulting from negligent acts or omissions.  

22. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, expenses, wage loss, and pain and suffering.  

23. Comparable Massachusetts precedent establishes a store’s liability when a customer is injured due to unremedied floor hazards.  *See* **Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., 208 Mass. 273 (1911)** (liability where hazard existed long enough for reasonable inspection); **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263 (1961)** (failure of grocery store to maintain safe aisle conditions); **Simmons v. W. F. Wood, Inc., 390 Mass. 857 (1984)**; **Toubiana v. Priestly, 402 Mass. 84 (1988)**.  

24. Massachusetts courts further recognize that the foreseeability of harm from spilled liquids in retail stores imposes a duty of periodic inspection and prompt cleanup.  *See* **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007)**.  

25. By failing to institute or follow reasonable inspection and cleanup procedures, Defendant directly violated its duty under the standards of ordinary care articulated in **Thurlow v. Crossman, 336 Mass. 248 (1957)** and **Coates v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 450 Mass. 490 (2008)**.  

26. Accordingly, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for negligence pursuant to the above‑referenced statutes and case law.

#### V. DAMAGES

27. As a result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately **$2,500**;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately **$1,200**;  
   c. Pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress; and  
   d. Continuing physical limitations and discomfort.

28. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence and to adjust the monetary amount of damages after further discovery.

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff against Defendant **Somerville Grocery Store LLC**;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably exceeding **$25,000**, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
C. Award interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
D. Award costs and reasonable expenses incurred in this action; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

#### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
