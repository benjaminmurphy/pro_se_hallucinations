### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

#### I. INTRODUCTION

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Samantha Johnson**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter 208, § 28**, and relevant case law, to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on **May 15, 2020**, on the grounds that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children, **Emily Johnson (age 8)** and **Ethan Johnson (age 6)**, such that continuation of the existing parenting schedule is no longer appropriate.

---

#### II. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Samantha Johnson, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555‑0123. Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Johnson, also residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the parents of two minor children:  
   - **Emily Johnson**, born [DOB Redacted], age 8.  
   - **Ethan Johnson**, born [DOB Redacted], age 6.

---

#### III. JURISDICTION AND PRIOR ORDER

4. This matter arises under the jurisdiction of the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court**, which entered a Judgment or Order regarding custody and parenting time on **May 15, 2020**, in Docket No. [original docket no. if known].  
5. At that time, the Court ordered **joint legal custody** of the children, with **primary physical custody** to the Plaintiff and a parenting schedule providing the Defendant parenting time every other weekend and one overnight each week.

---

#### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. The existing parenting schedule was established when both parties worked regular daytime hours, allowing each parent to safely and consistently care for the children.  
7. In or about **September 2025**, the Defendant began new employment requiring overnight shifts from **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** several nights per week, including many of the nights during which he is scheduled to have overnight parenting time.  
8. Since beginning this new schedule, the Defendant has on numerous occasions notified the Plaintiff, often on short notice, that he is too tired after work to care for the children overnight, and has requested or required the Plaintiff to assume unplanned overnight care.  
9. On other occasions, the Defendant has reportedly left the children at his residence with a roommate who is not a relative or known caregiver, without advance notice or the Plaintiff’s consent.  
10. The minor children have informed the Plaintiff that when visiting their father, they often fall asleep on the couch while he naps following his work shifts.  
11. These circumstances demonstrate that the Defendant’s overnight employment materially interferes with his ability to exercise the ordered overnight parenting time in a safe and consistent manner.  
12. The children’s stability, safety, and routines have been disrupted, creating anxiety and fatigue for both children and the Plaintiff.  
13. The Court’s primary concern under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31** and related statutes is the **best interests of the child**, which now require modification of the existing parenting schedule.  

---

#### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

14. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Court may modify a judgment relative to custody or parenting time “upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  
15. Similarly, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, applies the same standard to modifications concerning nonmarital children, emphasizing best interests and material change.  
16. Massachusetts case law holds that changes affecting a parent’s availability or ability to care for the child constitute a material change in circumstances. See, e.g.:  
   - **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests standard governs custody modifications);  
   - **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (substantial change in work schedule justified modification);  
   - **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (court must weigh the practical impact of changed circumstances on children’s welfare);  
   - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (material change must significantly affect child’s well-being);  
   - **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (court evaluates parents’ ability to meet children’s needs);  
   - **Pierce v. Pierce**, 455 Mass. 286 (2009) (employment changes affecting parenting capacity may require adjustment);  
   - **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (child’s emotional stability central to best interests analysis);  
   - **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (best interests involve continuity and safety);  
   - **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986) (caregiver fitness and capacity key to custody determinations); and  
   - **Zullo v. Goguen**, 423 Mass. 679 (1996) (court must prioritize children’s welfare above parental convenience).  
17. The Defendant’s new overnight work schedule constitutes a **substantial and material change** unforeseen at the time of the 2020 Order. His ability to care for the children overnight is significantly diminished, and this change adversely affects the children’s welfare.  
18. The requested modification to limit overnights to times when the Defendant is actually off duty serves the best interests of the children by ensuring continuity, restfulness, safety, and predictability.

#### VI. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Modify** the Judgment or Order entered on **May 15, 2020**, to provide that the Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur **only on nights when he is not required to work overnight shifts**, and that he shall provide the Plaintiff with **at least 48 hours’ notice** of any change or cancellation due to his work schedule;  

B. Maintain all other terms of the existing custody order, including joint legal custody, except as modified herein;  

C. Grant such **further relief** as this Court deems just and proper in accordance with **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and the best interests of the minor children.
