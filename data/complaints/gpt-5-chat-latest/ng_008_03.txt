---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful patron and invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 245 Washington Street in Quincy, Massachusetts.  
6. The layout of the premises included a narrow hallway between the kitchen and dining area, which customers were expected to traverse when accessing the restroom facilities.  
7. While Plaintiff was dining, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing several full water glasses in the hallway connecting the kitchen and dining room.  
8. The server promptly picked up the broken glass but left behind a substantial amount of water and ice on the tile floor, stating she would “be right back with a mop.”  
9. No warning signs, barriers, or other precautions were placed at or near the wet area to warn customers of the dangerous condition.  
10. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose from her seat to proceed to the restroom.  
11. As Plaintiff entered the hallway, she observed the floor glistening but believed it to be the natural shine of the tile.  
12. Unaware of the slippery condition, Plaintiff stepped onto the wet area, lost her footing, and fell, twisting her right knee.  
13. After the incident, Plaintiff overheard other staff members remarking that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time.  
14. Defendant’s employees did not provide immediate assistance or proper warnings to other patrons following the accident.  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a sprained knee that required an orthopedic brace, medical care, and a course of physical therapy lasting several weeks.  
16. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500 and lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to her inability to work during recovery.  
17. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent knee pain and discomfort as a result of the injury.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I – Negligence**

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully stated herein.  
19. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as an invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, inspection, and operation of its premises, including the duty to protect against, repair, or warn of unsafe and unreasonably dangerous conditions that Defendant knew or should have known existed.  
20. The law of Massachusetts imposes on property owners and occupiers a duty to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
21. Defendant breached this duty by failing to:  
   a. Remove the water and ice in a timely manner;  
   b. Place warning signs or cordon off the hazardous area;  
   c. Train and supervise its employees to take reasonable precautions after spills; and  
   d. Warn Plaintiff and other patrons of the danger.  
22. Under Massachusetts law, a restaurant owes its patrons a duty to warn of hazards that are known or reasonably foreseeable. *O’Sullivan v. Shaw*, 431 Mass. 201 (2000); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
23. Defendant’s failure to address the known and obvious spill constitutes a breach of ordinary care within the meaning of *Hubbard v. Palmer Russell Co.*, 343 Mass. 414 (1961).  
24. Defendant, through its employees, had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition, as demonstrated by staff members’ acknowledgment that they had been avoiding the puddle for some time before the incident. *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.*, 332 Mass. 560 (1955).  
25. Massachusetts courts hold that owners are liable when they fail to act reasonably to eliminate a known hazard, especially in high-traffic public areas. *Dattilo v. Best Foods, Inc.*, 338 Mass. 572 (1959); *Vertentes v. Barletta Co.*, 392 Mass. 165 (1984).  
26. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages. *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101 (1978).  
27. As a result, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages, for which Defendant is liable under Massachusetts law.  
28. The standard for negligence requires proof of duty, breach, causation, and damages, all of which are satisfied herein. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Coombes v. Florio*, 450 Mass. 182 (2007).  
29. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a violation of the reasonable person standard as articulated in *Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000), and *Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston*, 365 Mass. 320 (1974).

### IV. DAMAGES

30. As a direct, foreseeable, and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical injuries including a sprained knee;  
   b. Pain and suffering;  
   c. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500;  
   d. Lost wages of approximately $1,200;  
   e. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   f. Other damages to be proven at trial.  
31. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, believed to exceed $25,000;  
B. Reimbursement of all reasonable medical expenses, lost wages, and out-of-pocket costs;  
C. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as authorized by G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
D. Costs of this action; and  
E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
