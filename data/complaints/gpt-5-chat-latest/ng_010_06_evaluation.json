It does not address any duty regarding trees or other natural conditions on land, nor a general landowner obligation to ensure that trees and appurtenances do not pose risks to travelers. The case is therefore about sidewalk obstruction and nuisance, not tree-related duties of landowners along public ways.",

It does not address, state, or apply a rule about an occupier\u2019s duty to take reasonable care to remove or repair a dangerous condition, nor does it discuss breach by failure to do so. Therefore, this excerpt does not support the specific proposition about defendant\u2019s failure to use reasonable care regarding a dangerous condition.",
