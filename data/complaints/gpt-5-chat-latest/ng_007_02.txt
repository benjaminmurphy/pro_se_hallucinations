### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son was enrolled in the after-school program operated by Defendant at its facility located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, Massachusetts.  
5. Defendant represented to parents, including Plaintiff, that all children in the program would be supervised at all times during athletic and recreational activities.  
6. On the date in question, approximately twenty school-age children were present in the gymnasium. Defendant was supposed to provide at least two staff members for supervision.  
7. Only one staff member remained present, while the other left to perform paperwork in the office.  
8. The staff member who remained was seated by the bleachers and preoccupied with a mobile phone, providing minimal supervision.  
9. During that time, several older children, approximately twelve years old, began engaging in rough, tackle-style play on the hardwood gym floor.  
10. Other children attempted to alert the supervising staff member, but she dismissed the behavior, responding, “boys will be boys.”  
11. Shortly thereafter, one of the older children tackled Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son to the ground, causing him to strike his head on the hardwood floor.  
12. The child lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds.  
13. Emergency services were called, and Plaintiff’s son was transported to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a **concussion**.  
14. Plaintiff’s son missed several days of school and continues to suffer residual symptoms related to head trauma.  
15. Plaintiff incurred **medical expenses totaling approximately $5,500** directly attributable to this incident.  
16. Plaintiff did not lose wages but experienced significant emotional distress as a result of his child’s injury and recovery process.  
17. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising children in its custody and control.  
18. Defendant breached that duty by failing to provide adequate supervision, failing to maintain safe conditions, and failing to intervene to stop obviously dangerous horseplay.  
19. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s child’s injuries and Plaintiff’s resulting damages.

### COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

20. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1–19 above.  
21. Under Massachusetts law, a duty of reasonable care arises where one undertakes to supervise minors. *See* *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 435 Mass. 353 (2001); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
22. Defendant owed a legal duty to Plaintiff’s son to exercise reasonable care in the supervision of participants in its after-school program. *See* *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).  
23. Defendant breached this duty by failing to provide sufficient staff, neglecting to monitor children’s activities, and ignoring reports of rough play. *See* *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1987).  
24. Defendant’s acts and omissions created an unreasonable risk of physical harm, particularly given its knowledge that unsupervised play among children can lead to serious injury. *See* *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Carrier v. Riddell, Inc.*, 721 F.2d 867 (1st Cir. 1983).  
25. The breach of duty was the proximate and foreseeable cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff’s son. *See* *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101 (1978).  
26. Plaintiff suffered actual damages, including medical expenses and emotional distress stemming from the injury to his child.  
27. Under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, Defendant is liable for its negligent acts and omissions that caused injury to Plaintiff’s son.  
28. The doctrine of *respondeat superior* renders Defendant vicariously liable for the negligence of its employees acting within the scope of their employment. *See* *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317 (2002).  
29. Plaintiff did not contribute to the cause of the incident, and comparative negligence, under *G.L. c. 231, § 85*, does not bar or substantially reduce recovery in this case.  
30. Defendant’s negligent supervision constitutes a breach of its obligation under Massachusetts common law and foreseeably caused Plaintiff’s son’s injuries. *See* *Popponesset Beach Ass’n v. Marchillo*, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 586 (1996); *Canni v. St. Paul Pioneer Press*, 169 F. Supp. 2d 205 (D. Mass. 2001).

   c. Emotional distress and anxiety experienced by Plaintiff; and

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Brockton Community Center**;
