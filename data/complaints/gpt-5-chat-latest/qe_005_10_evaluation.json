The court\u2019s focus is on soot from a defective furnace, violations of the State Sanitary Code, warranty of habitability, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and G.L. c. 93A, not on sleep-related interference as such.

It explains that \u201cactual and consequential\u201d damages under the quiet enjoyment statute include personal injuries such as emotional harm, and in discussing overlapping damages it explicitly treats emotional distress as a compensable consequence of the interference with quiet enjoyment. Thus, the case supports the proposition that a quiet enjoyment breach can include substantial interference resulting in mental distress.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that tenants may recover \u2018actual and consequential\u2019 damages from landlords who have interfered with their quiet enjoyment of leased premises. \u2026 Generally, \u2018actual damages\u2019 are losses flowing directly from a wrongful act. \u2026 \u2018Consequential damages\u2019 cover all losses that are reasonably foreseeable to the actor\u2026 For example, consequential damages in an action based on contract or warranty may include personal injuries caused by the breach. \u2026 The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages, therefore, suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery.\u201d"

While Justice Quirico dissents from the majority\u2019s broader formulation of an implied warranty of habitability, he clearly recognizes a tenant\u2019s right to habitable premises and to be free from substantial violations of the sanitary code; the undisturbed-possession aspect is implicit in making habitability a landlord obligation tied to rent. Because this is a concurrence/dissent rather than the majority, it only moderately supports the proposition but is directionally accurate.",
