There is no discussion of childcare, supervision of minors, or a special duty based on such an undertaking, so the case does not support the claimed proposition.",

Furthermore, at the time that Kelly committed the murder, he had not started to work that day.\n\nOur analysis does not stop here. A special relationship between the parties may give rise to a common-law duty. \u2026 Here, the motion judge ruled that Titus & Bean did not have a duty to perform a background check on Kelley\u2019s prior criminal acts because it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would attack a member of the public.\u201d"

Lynn concerns municipal immunity under the discretionary function exception and the open-and-obvious danger doctrine, not foreseeability of assault or rough play due to negligent supervision. The court analyzes whether decisions about fencing, snow removal, and warning signs are discretionary policy choices and whether there was a duty to warn, but it does not address risks of assault, horseplay, or supervision of children. Thus it does not support the stated proposition about foreseeability of assault or rough play as a risk of inadequate supervision.",

We need not resolve this question, however, because the danger of sledding down the snow-covered stairs was open and obvious. \u2018Landowners are relieved of the duty to warn of open and obvious dangers on their premises because it is not reasonably foreseeable that a visitor exercising (as the law presumes) reasonable care for his own safety would suffer injury from such blatant hazards.\u2019\u201d"
