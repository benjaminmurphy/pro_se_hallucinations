**RACHEL BENNETT,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**DAVID CARTER,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Rachel Bennett**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, § 28, and any other applicable authority, for a modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on **June 15, 2021**, concerning the minor child **Sophie Carter (age 9)**.  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Rachel Bennett**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and primary custodial parent of the minor child, **Sophie Carter**, born [date of birth omitted for privacy].  
2. The Defendant, **David Carter**, currently resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts but has expressed the intent to relocate to **New Hampshire** for employment purposes.  
3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, as this Court issued the current custody and parenting order on **June 15, 2021** and continues to hold jurisdiction over custody matters involving the minor child.

---

### II. BACKGROUND AND EXISTING ORDER

4. On **June 15, 2021**, this Court entered a Judgment establishing the custodial and parenting time arrangement between Plaintiff and Defendant.  
5. Under that Judgment, the Plaintiff, Ms. Bennett, was granted **primary physical custody** of the parties’ daughter, **Sophie**.  
6. The Defendant, Mr. Carter, was granted **parenting time** every **Wednesday overnight** and **every other weekend**, consistent with the parties’ then mutual residence in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area, and the minor child’s enrollment in a local school system.  
7. The parenting plan was premised upon both parents living within close proximity to one another and the child’s school and activities, making midweek overnights practical and consistent with Sophie’s best interests.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since the entry of the prior order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** as defined under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and relevant Massachusetts law.  
9. Specifically, the Defendant, Mr. Carter, seeks to **relocate to New Hampshire** for employment purposes, a distance that would require approximately **ninety (90) minutes of driving each way**, depending on traffic, between his residence and Sophie’s school.  
10. The Defendant intends to maintain the current Wednesday overnight visitation schedule despite the increased travel burden.  
11. The proposed continuation of midweek overnights under these new geographic circumstances would result in Sophie enduring excessively long commutes, sleep disruption, anxiety about travel, and interference with her school attendance and after-school activities.  
12. The minor child has expressed anxiety regarding the long drives and difficulty keeping up with school and extracurricular engagements.  
13. The relocation and its impact on the existing schedule constitute a **material and substantial change** affecting the child’s welfare, necessitating modification of the prior order to preserve and protect her best interests.  
14. The Massachusetts courts have consistently recognized that a substantial geographic change materially altering the logistics of a parenting plan is sufficient grounds for modification. *See* **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  
15. The best interests of the child remain the paramount concern under Massachusetts law. *See* **G.L. c. 208, § 28**; **G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a)**; **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); **Delmolino v. Nance-Delmolino**, 386 Mass. 114 (1982).  
16. The requested modification serves the child’s welfare by ensuring that her custodial schedule remains stable, developmentally appropriate, and supportive of her educational and emotional wellbeing.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

17. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, this Court may modify a judgment relating to custody or parenting time upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and a finding that modification is in the **best interests of the child**.  
18. Courts have repeatedly held that a relocation or logistical change rendering an existing plan impractical constitutes such a material change. *See* **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Williams v. Massa**, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
19. When circumstances affecting the feasibility or effect of a parenting plan change substantially, the Court must craft a new arrangement that protects the child’s welfare. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **White v. LaGrassa**, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 383 (2011).

### V. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

20. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:  
   a. **Eliminate the Wednesday overnight visitation**, and in its place, provide the Defendant with reasonable midweek **dinner visits or virtual contact** as mutually agreed;  
   b. **Adjust weekend parenting time** to accommodate the increased distance, potentially by extending the Defendant’s alternate weekend from **Friday after school through Sunday evening**;  
   c. Confirm that **transportation responsibilities** be fairly allocated, considering each parent’s location; and  
   d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the child’s best interests.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Rachel Bennett**, respectfully prays that this Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the Judgment of June 15, 2021;  
2. Determine that modification of custody and parenting time is in the **best interests of the minor child, Sophie Carter**;  
3. Modify the prior Judgment by eliminating the midweek overnight, adjusting the weekend schedule as set forth herein, and issuing such additional orders as are fair and equitable;  
4. Award such further and general relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
