      "support_reasoning": "The concurring opinion excerpt deals with relocation, statutory interpretation under the paternity statute, and the limits of a judge\u2019s authority to order a custodial parent to return to Massachusetts. It does not discuss standards for later modification of custody or visitation, nor does it address the evidentiary role of a child\u2019s therapeutic evidence or the child\u2019s expressed wishes. Nothing in the provided text suggests that the child\u2019s therapy-related evidence or desire for more time with a parent is identified as a legitimate factor supporting modification.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "After paternity was established, the judge was obligated to take as a given that the mother and the child resided 400 miles apart from, and in another State than, the father, and to fashion custody and visitation orders pursuant to the three factors set out in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), again respecting and not disturbing the mother\u2019s decision to relocate. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003) ('If the parenting arrangement in which a child has lived is satisfactory and is reasonably capable of preservation, it is ordinarily in the child\u2019s best interests to maintain that arrangement...')."
