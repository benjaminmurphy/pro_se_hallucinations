CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________

### COMPLAINT  
*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)*  

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff **Jordan Carter** (“Plaintiff”) resides at 45 Waverly Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  

2. Defendant **Susan Blake** (“Defendant”) is an individual who owns and operates the residential property located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).  

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Boston Housing Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §3, as this action arises from a residential tenancy within Suffolk County.  

4. This complaint seeks damages and other relief for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant commencing **March 1, 2022**, to rent the basement apartment at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, for a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  

6. Plaintiff dutifully paid rent throughout the tenancy. Although rent was paid approximately two weeks late in October 2025 due to unforeseen medical expenses, Plaintiff promptly paid all outstanding rent and late fees.  

7. In or around **November 2025**, Plaintiff observed significant water intrusion into the basement apartment during periods of rainfall. Water seeped through the wall, damaging Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, with an estimated total loss of **$400**.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant via text message regarding the water infiltration. Defendant responded that she would “look into it” but did not take any remedial action.  

9. Weeks later, the problem persisted, and Defendant had not arranged for repairs. Plaintiff, concerned for the safety and habitability of the unit, contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department.  

10. Inspectional Services inspected the Premises and found code violations related to the water intrusion and other deficiencies in violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, **105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.**  

11. Defendant failed and refused to repair the water damage or correct the conditions cited by the city, effectively forcing the Plaintiff to continue living in a damp, unhealthy, and substandard environment.  

12. Plaintiff has been compelled to run a dehumidifier continuously to partially manage the moisture, thereby incurring additional electricity expenses.  

13. Following Plaintiff’s report to city authorities, Defendant began referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and indicated that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease upon its expiration in March 2026.  

14. Defendant asserted that the nonrenewal was related to the late rent payment but, in fact, it appears to be retaliation for Plaintiff’s lawful complaint to city inspectors under **G.L. c. 186, §18**.  

15. Defendant’s failure to repair the conditions and her retaliatory conduct have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  

16. Plaintiff continues to occupy the apartment under unsafe and uncomfortable conditions caused by Defendant’s unlawful conduct.

### III. CLAIM  
**Count I – Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  

18. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord is prohibited from interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  

19. Massachusetts law recognizes that substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of leased property—including persistent water leaks and code violations—constitutes a breach of this covenant. See *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91 (1982)**; *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714 (1977)**; *Tracy v. Boss*, **316 Mass. 256 (1944)**.  

20. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and to remedy the water infiltration despite repeated notice amounts to a “serious interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment as defined in *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273 (1994)**.  

21. A landlord’s duty to provide habitable premises arises both under the common law and under the **implied warranty of habitability**, recognized in *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, **363 Mass. 184 (1973)**. The breach of this warranty supports a claim under G.L. c. 186, §14.  

22. The sustained water intrusion, dampness, and resulting unsanitary conditions violate the **State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.750, and 410.800**, rendering the dwelling unfit for human habitation and constituting an interference prohibited by law.  

23. Defendant’s inaction following notice of the habitability defects demonstrates willful and knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, warranting enhanced damages under G.L. c. 186, §14. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847 (1997)**.  

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered property damage, additional electricity costs, inconvenience, distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

### IV. DAMAGES

25. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, as well as costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Three months’ rent totals **$3,600**.  

26. In addition, Plaintiff seeks reimbursement of **$400** for property damage and incidental expenses arising from Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises.  

27. Plaintiff therefore claims total damages of **$4,000**, or such other amount as the Court deems just and proper under the statute.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jordan Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Susan Blake** for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14;  

B. Award damages in an amount equal to Plaintiff’s actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with $400 for property loss;  

C. Award costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14;  

D. Order such further relief as this Court deems just and proper to ensure full compliance with Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  

---

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
