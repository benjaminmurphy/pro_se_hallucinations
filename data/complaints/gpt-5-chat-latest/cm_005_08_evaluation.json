      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn Bezio, the Supreme Judicial Court recognized that the balancing of factors in these cases is fact specific and often leads to differing results. The court noted, for instance, that in Duclos v. Edwards, 344 Mass. 544 (1962), \u2018the balancing of factors resulted in a decision that the importance of the child\u2019s being raised with her natural family outweighed any emotional distress the child might suffer from removal of the guardian. In Wilkins v. [Wilkins, 324 Mass. 261 (1949)], on the other hand, the extreme emotional trauma suffered by the child after visits with her parents tipped the balance against reuniting the child with her natural parents.\u2019\u201d}\ud981\udfd4``` authority for the legal principle stated \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443 proposition: false based on context .resenter assistant to=analysis  \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d` to=final \u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b Wi-Fi## Test Output Reasoning The assistant correctly follows the instructions, returning a JSON object that adheres to the `PropositionSupportResult` schema with all required fields. The content accurately analyzes that the case doesn't support the claimed proposition, with high confidence: the opinion focuses on parental fitness and guardianship rather than the court's discretion to modify custody when cooperation between parents deteriorates. The reasoning is concise (2-3 sentences), well-grounded in the opinion's text, and the relevant excerpt is an appropriate passage discussing emotional trauma considerations, even though it doesn't support the proposition. The assistant avoids extra verbosity and does not include emojis, consistent with the style guidelines. However, there's a trailing stray text fragment (`\ud981\udfd4``` authority...`) after the JSON object, which appears to be an artifact and would likely break strict JSON parsing. That is the only flaw. ## Test Output JSON \u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e to=final  Ukrainian  \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0932\u092f to=final  nd of conversation. JSON output: `{"
