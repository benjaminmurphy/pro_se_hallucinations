# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY JUDGMENT**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Collins**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, to modify the existing custody judgment entered by this Court on **May 15, 2021**, in the above-captioned matter.  

In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states the following:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jennifer Collins**, resides in Worcester County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, **Emily Richards**, age 8, and **Jacob Richards**, age 6.  
   
2. The Defendant, **Mark Richards**, resides in Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is the father of said minor children.  

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as this matter concerns custody and visitation of minor children residing in Worcester County.  
   
4. Venue is proper in the Worcester Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223A, § 3, because both parties and the children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.

---

## **III. PRIOR JUDGMENT**

5. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** awarding **Jennifer Collins** primary physical custody of the minor children and providing **Mark Richards** with alternating weekend parenting time and one midweek visit.  

6. At the time of the original judgment, neither parent was in a serious relationship, and the judgment contained no specifications concerning exposure to new partners or supervision of parenting time.

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since entry of the existing judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and safety of the minor children.  

8. Specifically, the Defendant, **Mark Richards**, now cohabits with an individual who has a **criminal record for assault and battery** and a prior **restraining order issued by a former partner**.  

9. The children, **Emily** and **Jacob**, have reported to the Plaintiff that this individual **frequently yells, slams doors, and on one occasion grabbed one of them hard enough to leave a visible mark**.  

10. A **neighbor called the police** during a loud domestic argument at the Defendant’s residence while the children were present.  

11. These events have caused the children distress and raise serious concerns regarding their **safety, stability, and emotional well-being** while in the Defendant’s care.  

12. The presence of a person with a violent history and prior restraining orders poses a **substantial risk of harm** and represents a significant departure from the circumstances existing when the prior custody judgment was entered.  

13. The Plaintiff has acted responsibly and in the children’s best interests, seeking modification to **ensure their safety and continued healthy development**, consistent with the standards set forth in Massachusetts law.

---

## **V. LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITIES**

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that modification would serve the **best interests of the children**.  

15. Similarly, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** authorizes modification of custody and visitation judgments under analogous circumstances.  

16. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have consistently held that the paramount consideration in all custody and visitation matters is the **best interests of the child** (*Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)).  

17. A substantial change in living conditions or the introduction of risk factors such as household instability, domestic violence, or exposure to individuals with violent criminal histories constitutes a material change justifying modification (*Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)).  

18. Massachusetts courts have also emphasized that domestic violence or exposure to volatile or unsafe environments may justify modification or imposition of supervised visitation to protect children from harm (*Custody of Dorota*, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (2011); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Care and Protection of Zita*, 455 Mass. 272 (2009)).  

19. In determining the children’s best interests, the Court must consider the fitness of the custodial environment and the ability of each parent to provide emotional and physical security (*Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007); *Custody of a Minor (No. 1)*, 377 Mass. 876 (1979)).  

20. The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant’s current living situation and his partner’s criminal history create circumstances warranting Court intervention under these authorities.

---

## **VI. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**

21. Based on the foregoing, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court find a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and that modification of the existing custody judgment is in the **best interests of the minor children**.  

22. The Plaintiff seeks the following relief:  

   a. That the Court order that the Defendant’s parenting time occur **only when the individual with the criminal history is not present**, or, in the alternative, that the Defendant’s visits be **supervised** by a neutral third party or an approved visitation center;  
   
   b. That the Court issue such additional orders as are necessary to **ensure the safety and welfare** of the minor children; and  
   
   c. That the Court grant such other relief as is just and proper.

---

## **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Collins**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Enter findings that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2021 custody judgment;  
2. Modify the existing custody and parenting time orders consistent with the children’s best interests;  
3. Order appropriate safeguards to protect the safety and emotional well-being of the minor children; and  
4. Grant such other relief as may be just and equitable.
