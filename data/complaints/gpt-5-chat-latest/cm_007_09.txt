### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**Lisa Thornton,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Michael Thornton,**  
Defendant.

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, *Lisa Thornton*, pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and Supplemental Probate and Family Court Rule 29*, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on June 15, 2018, to reflect a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the parties’ minor child, *Emma Thornton (age 12).*  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. The Bristol Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and *G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, as the original custody judgment was entered by this Court on June 15, 2018.  
2. Both parties and the minor child continue to reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; venue is therefore proper in this Court.

### IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

1. On June 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Schedule awarding the parties **shared physical custody** of their minor child on an alternating week schedule (50/50 arrangement).  

2. At the time the order was entered, both parents lived within close proximity, shared parental responsibilities effectively, and maintained stable health and environments conducive to a shared custody arrangement.  

3. For several years following entry of the judgment, the shared physical custody plan worked well; Emma enjoyed strong routines, consistent schooling, and a close relationship with each parent.  

4. Since that time, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances**.  

5. The Defendant, *Michael Thornton*, has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that significantly impacts his mobility and ability to care physically for the minor child.  

6. The Defendant has experienced multiple falls in the home, has limited ability to navigate stairs, and, according to his treating physician, should not be left alone with the child in situations requiring quick physical response.  

7. Despite medical advice, the Defendant continues to insist upon maintaining the previous 50/50 physical custody schedule.  

8. As a result, the minor child, Emma, has been placed in situations requiring her to assist her father physically, including helping him transfer from his wheelchair to bed and fetching items for him around the house, which places an inappropriate caregiving burden upon her.  

9. These circumstances have created stress, safety concerns, and emotional strain for the child, affecting her school performance and general well-being.  

10. The Plaintiff, *Lisa Thornton,* remains willing and able to facilitate frequent, meaningful contact between the child and the Defendant in a manner consistent with the Defendant’s health and safety limitations.  

11. The Plaintiff seeks modification to designate her as the child’s **primary physical custodian**, with reasonable parenting time for the Defendant consistent with the child’s best interests and his current medical capacities.

### V. LEGAL STANDARD

1. Under *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and *G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that modification is in the **best interests of the child.**

2. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that a modification of custody is justified where changed circumstances significantly affect the child’s welfare.  *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

3. Health or medical deterioration of a parent can constitute a material change warranting modification when the parent’s capacity to meet the child’s needs is impacted.  *See* **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Ellis v. Ellis**, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 1004 (1996).  

4. Courts emphasize that the best interests of the child remain the paramount concern.  *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 840–841 (2003).  

5. The relevant inquiry balances the child’s health, safety, emotional development, and stability.  *See* **Mandel v. Mandel**, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 348 (2009); **M.C. v. T.K.**, 463 Mass. 226 (2012).  

6. Additionally, *G.L. c. 208, § 31* defines legal and physical custody, providing that the court must evaluate whether continued shared custody serves the child’s best interests in light of current circumstances.  

7. The Court retains continuing jurisdiction to make such modifications as justice requires.  *See* **Champion v. Champion**, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).  

8. Where continuation of a shared custody plan would place undue responsibility, risk, or anxiety on the minor child, modification is warranted to preserve the child’s welfare.  *See* **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

### VI. ARGUMENT

1. The Defendant’s progressive neurological condition and resulting physical limitations constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** unforeseen at the time of the original custody judgment.  

2. The current 50/50 shared physical custody plan is no longer feasible or consistent with Emma’s best interests because it places her in unsafe and emotionally taxing situations concerned with the Defendant’s care rather than her own development.  

3. The Plaintiff can provide a stable, secure, and nurturing home environment where the child’s educational, emotional, and physical needs are adequately met.  

4. The Defendant remains a loving and important presence in Emma’s life; however, parenting time must be modified to prioritize safety and the medical realities now present.  

5. The requested modification advances the child’s welfare and aligns with Massachusetts precedent recognizing that the custodial arrangement must adapt as circumstances materially change and the child’s best interests so require.

### VII. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Lisa Thornton**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the June 15, 2018 custody judgment.  
2. Modify the existing custody order to award **primary physical custody** of *Emma Thornton* to the Plaintiff.  
3. Establish a parenting-time schedule for the Defendant, *Michael Thornton*, consistent with his health limitations and the child’s best interests, including but not limited to supervised or daytime visitation as appropriate.  
4. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.
