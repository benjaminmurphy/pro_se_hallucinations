---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Emily Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 45 Broadway Street, Apartment __, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  
2. Defendant **John Ramirez** (“Defendant”) is an individual and the landlord and owner of the residential property located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 185C, §3**, as the amount in controversy is less than $50,000 and arises from a residential tenancy located in Chelsea, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court because the rental premises are located in Chelsea and the events giving rise to this action occurred therein. See **Mass. R. Civ. P. 3** and **G.L. c. 223, §1**.

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts, with monthly rent of $1,500.  
6. Plaintiff consistently paid rent and complied with all material terms of the tenancy.  
7. Approximately two months prior to December 1, 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the main entry door lock to the building was broken and did not latch, allowing anyone to enter the building freely.  
8. Defendant acknowledged the issue but failed to repair the lock despite repeated reminders by Plaintiff.  
9. In or around November 2025, an unknown individual entered the building and rifled through tenants’ mail; several tenants, including Plaintiff, reported missing packages. Plaintiff lost a package valued at approximately $120.  
10. Plaintiff also discovered evidence that an unknown person had been sleeping in the building’s basement, creating safety and security concerns.  
11. Plaintiff, fearing for her safety, purchased a personal door security camera and replaced the deadbolt on her unit door at her own expense, costing approximately $200.  
12. When Plaintiff raised these concerns again, Defendant dismissed them, stating that Plaintiff was “overreacting.”  
13. As a result of Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff has suffered loss of property, out-of-pocket expenses, emotional distress, and substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment and security of her dwelling.  
14. Plaintiff has incurred total damages of approximately **$320**, representing $120 in stolen property and $200 in protective expenses, plus emotional distress and statutory damages as allowed by law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” A violation entitles the tenant to actual and statutory damages.  
17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every tenancy. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).  
18. A landlord breaches this covenant when their conduct, or failure to act, substantially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).  
19. Defendant’s failure to repair a defective entry door lock after notice constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s right to safely and privately occupy her dwelling. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997) (landlord’s failure to remedy dangerous condition amounts to substantial interference).  
20. The repeated unauthorized entries and Theft of tenant mail are consequences directly flowing from Defendant’s neglect, which courts have found constitute breaches of quiet enjoyment. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 199 (1979) (landlord liable for failure to ensure safe access to premises).  
21. Defendant’s conduct in ignoring Plaintiff’s repeated complaints demonstrates reckless disregard for her right to quiet enjoyment, similar to the landlord’s neglect found actionable in **Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.**, 439 Mass. 512, 517 (2003).  
22. Defendant’s failure to maintain security also violates **G.L. c. 186, §14** and **G.L. c. 93A, §2**, as construed in **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (security-related defects deemed interference).  
23. Massachusetts courts have imposed liability under §14 for persistent violations affecting safety or habitability. See **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005); **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
24. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate building security also constitutes a violation of the landlord’s duty to maintain common areas in a reasonably safe condition, reinforcing the breach of the covenant. See **Lipsitt v. Plaisted**, 466 Mass. 240, 245–46 (2013).  
25. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered property loss, anxiety, diminished habitability, and out-of-pocket expenses.

### V. DAMAGES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages or **three months’ rent**, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.  
27. Plaintiff therefore seeks:  
   a. Statutory damages of three months’ rent ($1,500 × 3 = **$4,500**) under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
   b. Alternatively, actual damages in the amount of **$320** plus additional compensation for emotional distress;  
   c. Costs and any other relief this Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **John Ramirez**, and that the Court award:

1. Statutory damages pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, or actual damages of at least $320;  
2. Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
3. Prejudgment interest under **G.L. c. 231, §6B**;  
4. Any and all other relief the Court deems just and proper.
