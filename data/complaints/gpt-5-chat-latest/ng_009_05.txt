# COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Jessica Carter (“Plaintiff”), by and for herself, brings this Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

## II. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Carter is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, Lynn, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns and operates the residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts (the “Premises”). Defendant’s principal place of business is, on information and belief, in Essex County, Massachusetts.  

---

## III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 223 because the events giving rise to these claims occurred within the Commonwealth and within the judicial district of this Court.  
4. Venue is proper in Lynn District Court because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Lynn, Massachusetts.

---

## IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff resided on the third floor of the Premises.  
6. Defendant, as the owner and landlord, had a statutory and common-law duty to maintain all smoke detectors in the common areas, including hallways, pursuant to G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E and 26F, and the Massachusetts State Fire Code, 527 C.M.R. 1.00.  
7. For several months prior to September 15, 2023, the smoke detector installed in the third-floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit emitted a recurrent low-battery chirping sound.  
8. At some point, a person—identity unknown—removed the battery from that alarm and left it on the windowsill of the hallway.  
9. Plaintiff personally notified Defendant of the inoperative detector on at least three separate occasions, and Defendant’s representative verbally promised each time to “take care of it.”  
10. Defendant failed and neglected to replace the battery or restore a functioning smoke alarm.  
11. On the night of September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in the first-floor kitchen of another apartment in the Premises.  
12. Because the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit had been disabled, there was no audible alarm to warn Plaintiff or other residents on the upper floors of the fire.  
13. Plaintiff awoke only after smelling heavy smoke. By that time, the hallway was already filled with thick smoke, severely limiting her ability to breathe and evacuate.  
14. Plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation injuries, was transported by ambulance to a hospital, and remained overnight for observation.  
15. Plaintiff incurred approximately \$5,000 in medical expenses and lost approximately \$1,200 in wages during her recovery.  
16. Plaintiff also sustained significant smoke and water damage to personal property located within her apartment.  
17. Defendant’s failure to maintain a working smoke detector was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and property losses.

## V. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
19. To establish negligence under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the plaintiff suffered damages; and (4) the defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of those damages. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006).  
20. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the Premises and its common areas, including smoke detection equipment, in reasonably safe condition. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  
21. Defendant also had statutory duties under G.L. c. 186, § 15; G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E–26F; and the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.482(B), which requires landlords to maintain operable smoke detectors in multifamily dwellings. Violation of such statutes constitutes evidence of negligence. *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990).  
22. Defendant breached its duties by failing to ensure that the smoke detector in the third-floor hallway was operational and by ignoring multiple tenant complaints about the inoperative alarm.  
23. In the landlord‑tenant context, the landlord is liable in negligence for injuries caused by failure to remedy dangerous conditions in common areas under the landlord’s control. *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 165 (1980).  
24. Defendant’s inaction constituted a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and other tenants. *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  
25. Plaintiff was a person lawfully on the premises to whom this duty was owed. *Souza v. Prario*, 456 Mass. 472, 476 (2010).  
26. Defendant’s breach was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as the lack of an operating smoke detector delayed her awareness of the fire, resulting in harmful smoke exposure. *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).  
27. Defendant knew or should have known that disabling or failing to maintain smoke alarms creates a substantial risk of serious injury or death from fire. *Jalbert v. Lafayette Ins. Co.*, 464 Mass. 43, 49 (2013).  
28. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were a direct and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligence. *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 284; see also *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 732 (2000).  
29. Plaintiff has complied with or is exempt from any applicable notice requirements under Massachusetts law. *G.L. c. 84, § 18* (by analogy).

## VI. DAMAGES

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical injury in the form of smoke inhalation;  
   b. Medical expenses of approximately \$5,000;  
   c. Lost wages of approximately \$1,200;  
   d. Pain and suffering;  
   e. Emotional distress and anxiety related to the fire; and  
   f. Property damage to her personal belongings.  

---

## VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed \$6,200;  
C. Award interest and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
D. Award statutory attorney’s fees if applicable under G.L. c. 93A (to the extent any unfair act is found); and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

## VIII. JURY DEMAND

Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
