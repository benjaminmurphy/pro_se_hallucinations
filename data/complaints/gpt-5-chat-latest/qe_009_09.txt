# **COMPLAINT**

---

## **I. INTRODUCTION**

This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Collins (“Plaintiff”) against her landlord, Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**, arising from Defendant’s failure to repair electrical defects that rendered a portion of Plaintiff’s leased apartment uninhabitable. Defendant’s failure to timely remedy these substantial defects constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights.

---

## **II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff Jessica Collins** is an individual residing at 125 Maple Street, Apartment 2B, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.  
2. **Defendant Mark Thompson** is an individual doing business as a residential landlord with an address believed to be in or around Springfield, Massachusetts. Defendant owns and manages the rental property located at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

---

## **III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this action involves a landlord-tenant dispute regarding a residential tenancy within the jurisdiction of the Western Division Housing Court Department.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court because the leased property is located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the cause of action arose there.

---

## **IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to lease a two-bedroom apartment located at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of **$1,200.00**.  
6. The tenancy has continued on a month-to-month basis under the same terms since its inception.  
7. As of approximately **October 15, 2025**, one of the two bedrooms in the leased premises lost electrical power entirely—neither the overhead light fixture nor any outlets functioned.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant inspected the premises and subsequently sent an electrician, who informed both Plaintiff and Defendant that significant wiring repair work would be required.  
9. Defendant has failed to complete the necessary repair for over **six weeks** as of the date of this filing.  
10. As a result of the defective electrical condition, Plaintiff cannot use one of the apartment’s two bedrooms, which was previously used as her home office.  
11. Plaintiff has been forced to work elsewhere, including coffee shops and a coworking space, incurring substantial additional expenses totaling approximately **$15 per day** and **$150 per month** in coworking fees.  
12. Plaintiff has notified Defendant multiple times of the continued electrical outage; Defendant has repeatedly responded that repairs are “complicated” but has taken no substantive steps to restore electricity.  
13. Plaintiff continues to tender rent of $1,200 per month, notwithstanding that a portion of the apartment has become uninhabitable.  
14. Defendant’s failure to repair violates the landlord’s statutory duty to maintain the premises in compliance with the **Massachusetts State Sanitary Code**, **105 CMR 410.351** (requiring that every habitable room be provided with adequate electrical service).  
15. The deprivation of electrical service to a bedroom constitutes a significant interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, amounting to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

---

## **V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.”  
18. Massachusetts law implies a covenant of quiet enjoyment in every residential lease. See **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)**.  
19. The covenant is breached when a landlord, by act or omission, subjects the tenant to serious interference with her tenancy. See **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)**.  
20. Defendant’s failure to repair the electrical wiring, rendering one bedroom unusable for over six weeks, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
21. Defendant’s continued inaction despite knowledge of the defect amounts to “indirect interference” within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**. See **Jablonski v. Clemons, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004)** (landlord’s failure to repair electrical problems constitutes actionable interference).  
22. Massachusetts courts recognize that significant loss of use due to defective housing conditions violates the covenant. See **Cruz Management Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994)**; **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994)**.  
23. A landlord’s ongoing failure to maintain essential services such as heat, electricity, or water can support damages under the statute. See **Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**; **Davis v. Allard, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 508 (1994)**.  
24. The duty to maintain habitable premises arises under both **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and **the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.** See **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)** (landlord must comply with code standards); **Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)**.  
25. Defendant’s inaction has deprived Plaintiff of the beneficial use of a substantial portion of her apartment, constituting constructive partial eviction and actionable interference. See **Dorgan v. Loukas, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1985)**.  
26. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: (a) deprivation of adequate living and working space; (b) expenses for alternative work accommodations; and (c) frustration, inconvenience, and discomfort.  
27. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

---

## **VI. DAMAGES**

28. Plaintiff’s rent is $1,200 per month. Three months’ rent equals **$3,600.00**.  
29. Plaintiff’s actual consequential costs over the six-week period include approximately **$900.00** in out-of-pocket expenses for coffee shop and coworking space fees, plus loss of use of a bedroom constituting at least 50% of the unit’s functional space.  
30. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks damages in the statutory amount of three months’ rent under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, or such other amount as the Court deems just, plus costs and attorney’s fees.

---

## **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Collins** respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Find that Defendant **Mark Thompson** has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **three months’ rent ($3,600.00)**, or alternatively **actual damages of at least $900.00**, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
C. Award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as permitted by statute;  
D. Order Defendant to promptly repair the electrical wiring in the affected bedroom to restore electricity; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

## **VIII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
