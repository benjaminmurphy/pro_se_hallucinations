### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a public path at **Chestnut Hill Park**, Newton, Massachusetts.  

7. The park is posted with clear signage stating that **all dogs must be kept on leashes** at all times.  

8. Defendant **regularly allowed his large dog to roam freely** in the park, despite these posted leash requirements.  

9. On the date of the incident, Defendant was present at the park with his dog. The dog was **unleashed**, and Defendant was approximately **thirty feet away**, holding the leash draped over his shoulder while engaging in conversation with others.  

10. As Plaintiff jogged along the path, Defendant’s dog suddenly **charged toward her**, barking loudly and aggressively.  

11. Plaintiff, reasonably fearing that the dog was about to attack or bite her, **swerved off the paved path** to avoid the charging animal.  

12. As a direct result of swerving, Plaintiff **tripped over a tree root**, lost her footing, and **fell down a small embankment**, suffering a **broken wrist**.  

13. The dog stopped near Plaintiff after her fall, and Defendant then called the dog back.  

14. Several bystanders witnessed the entire event.  

15. Plaintiff was transported to a local emergency room where she was treated for her fractured wrist, required to wear a brace for several weeks, and lost use of her dominant hand during recovery.  

16. Plaintiff incurred **medical expenses of approximately $5,000** and **lost wages of approximately $1,200** during her recovery period.  

17. Plaintiff also suffered **pain, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life**, including being unable to perform in a piano recital she had been preparing for.

### III. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a **duty of reasonable care** to other park users, including Plaintiff, to control his dog and comply with applicable leash laws and posted regulations. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); *Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co.*, 407 Mass. 185 (1990).  

20. Defendant breached that duty by allowing his dog to run loose and unsupervised in a public park, in violation of both the posted rules and **G.L. c. 140, §173**, which authorizes municipalities to regulate and require dogs to be restrained.  

21. Defendant’s negligence created a **foreseeable risk of injury**, including that park users might be frightened or physically harmed by the sudden approach of an unleashed dog. See *Coyne v. City of Somerville*, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 420 (1996) (foreseeability central to negligence).  

22. It was **reasonably foreseeable** that Plaintiff, startled by an aggressive dog charging at her, might instinctively flee or move to avoid contact, potentially causing a fall and resulting injuries. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (negligent acts include foreseeable reactions to danger).  

23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes **negligence per se** under Massachusetts law because he violated a safety regulation intended to protect members of the public—namely, the **City of Newton’s leash ordinance** enacted pursuant to **G.L. c. 140, §§173–174E**. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355 (1990) (violation of safety statute provides evidence of negligence).  

24. As a **direct and proximate result** of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and endured pain and suffering. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty to control one’s property and animals where third-party injury foreseeable); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (negligence standard requires reasonable foreseeability of harm).  

25. Plaintiff’s injuries were not due to any negligent act or omission of her own but were instead **caused entirely by Defendant’s failure to properly restrain and control his dog**. See *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991) (ordinary principles of negligence apply where defendant’s carelessness induces plaintiff’s injury).  

26. Defendant’s duty and breach are further supported by *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) (duty of care exists when actor’s conduct poses risk of harm to others); *McGuiggan v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co.*, 398 Mass. 152 (1986) (reasonable person standard governs negligence actions); and *Adams v. Bullock*, 227 Mass. 377 (1917) (negligence judged by foreseeable risk).  

27. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for all injuries proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost earnings, and pain and suffering. See *Mass. Gen. Laws* c. 231, §§6B–6D (authorizing recovery of interest and damages for personal injury).

### IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, and award the following relief:  

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably estimated to exceed **$6,200** for medical bills and lost wages, plus additional damages for pain and suffering;  
B. Pre‑ and post‑judgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §6B**;  
C. Costs of this action; and  
D. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

### V. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
