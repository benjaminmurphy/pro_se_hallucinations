---

### I. INTRODUCTION

1. Plaintiff Jessica Wallis (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against her landlord, Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), for breach of the statutory and common law covenant of quiet enjoyment arising out of Defendant’s failure to protect Plaintiff from substantial interference caused by extended and disruptive renovation work at the property she rents in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2. This action seeks actual and statutory damages under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §14 and related Massachusetts common law, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as permitted by statute.

---

### II. PARTIES

3. Plaintiff **Jessica Wallis** resides at **218 Harvard Street, Unit __, Cambridge, MA 02139** (“the Premises”), which she rents from Defendant pursuant to a written lease agreement dated May 1, 2021.  

4. Defendant **Mark Thompson** is an individual residing, upon information and belief, in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, who owns and manages the rental property at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, MA.  

---

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 218, §19** and **M.G.L. c. 231, §1**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.  

6. Venue is proper in the **Cambridge District Court** pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 223, §8**, because the property that is the subject of this action is located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff has lawfully occupied the Premises since **May 1, 2021**, under a residential tenancy agreement at a monthly rent of **$2,300**.  

8. In or around **October 2025**, Defendant commenced renovation of the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s.  

9. Since that time, and continuing through at least **December 1, 2025**, construction activities—including drilling, hammering, and loud conversation among workers—have occurred on most weekdays between approximately **8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M.**  

10. The noise levels have been substantial and persistent, interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to concentrate and work from home.  

11. Construction activity has also generated significant **dust and debris**, which have entered Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system, causing additional discomfort and inconvenience.  

12. The disruptions have lasted over **two months** and remain ongoing, with Defendant having indicated that work may continue for an additional month or more.

13. Defendant was notified by Plaintiff on multiple occasions of the intensity and impact of the disturbances, but has taken no adequate steps to mitigate the intrusions.

14. Defendant offered Plaintiff a rent reduction of **$100 for one month**, which failed to reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the continued substantial interference with her tenancy.

15. Plaintiff has continued to pay her rent as required and has not destroyed, damaged, or misused the Premises in any way.

16. Defendant’s actions and omissions have substantially impaired Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her rented dwelling, in violation of **M.G.L. c. 186, §14** and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized under Massachusetts common law.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered distress, loss of use and enjoyment of her home, and economic damages estimated at **$500.**

### V. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, §14)**

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–17 as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for actual and statutory damages.  

20. The statute provides that such interference, if substantial and without justification, constitutes a breach irrespective of the landlord’s intent. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  

21. Defendant’s conduct—including prolonged, excessive noise and dust arising from renovations under his control—constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

22. Courts have found comparable disturbances to violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (noise from lounge next door under landlord’s control constituted breach);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord liable for persistent flooding and failure to protect tenant’s habitability);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (repeated noise and interference can constitute breach even absent eviction);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord’s actions causing tenant’s loss of enjoyment are actionable);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. **Wendt v. Handler**, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 162 (2014) (landlord liable for failing to address harmful conditions within control);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment breach shown where landlord fails to prevent foreseeable interference);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (substantial noise and invasions sufficient for statutory damages);  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. **Emigrant Mtge. Co. v. D’Agostino**, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2016) (recognizing covenant as integral to tenant’s possessory interest).  

23. Defendant’s knowledge of the disturbance, combined with his failure to prevent or minimize its impact, establishes a “direct or indirect interference” under the meaning of the statute. See **Auburn Woods Homeowners Ass’n v. Fair Housing Council of Oregon**, 490 U.S. 99 (1989, analogy to nuisance principle as applied in MA law); **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  

24. By reason of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual damages, statutory damages of at least one month’s rent** pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, and reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Award Plaintiff **actual damages** in the amount of **$500**, or such other sum as the Court deems just;  
C. Award **statutory damages** of **one month’s rent ($2,300)** under M.G.L. c. 186, §14;  
D. Award **reasonable attorney’s fees and costs** as provided by law;  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VIII. CONCLUSION

Defendant’s prolonged construction work and failure to prevent severe noise and dust infiltration constituted an actionable breach of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment guaranteed by **M.G.L. c. 186, §14** and Massachusetts common law. Plaintiff seeks fair compensation and statutory relief for the deprivation of peaceful use and enjoyment of her home.
