Although the specific issue was whether a *strict-liability* lead paint violation alone suffices (the court held it does not), the case affirmatively recognizes that, where the landlord has notice or reason to know of a dangerous condition and fails to act reasonably, that failure can breach quiet enjoyment under \u00a7 14 and the implied covenant.

The court explains that omissions such as failing to repair known defects can violate \u00a7 14 and, applying that principle, finds a violation where inadequate heat and hot water and vermin infestation substantially impaired the value of the premises.
