# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

---

### **INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully files this **Complaint for Modification** pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7**, seeking modification of the judgment of custody and parenting time entered by this Honorable Court on **April 15, 2021**. Since entry of that judgment, a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred which warrants modification in order to serve the **best interests of the minor child**, **Emily Johnson**, age 8.

---

### **PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Sarah Johnson, residing in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Mark Thompson, formerly residing in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and now intending to relocate to New Hampshire for employment.

3. The parties are the parents of **Emily Johnson**, born [date intentionally omitted for privacy], age 8.

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, as the original custody order was entered by the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** on April 15, 2021.

5. Venue is proper in Middlesex County as the Plaintiff continues to reside within this judicial district and the original judgment issued from this Court.

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On **April 15, 2021**, the Court entered a custody order providing that the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, have **primary physical custody** of the parties’ minor child, **Emily Johnson**, with the Defendant to have **parenting time** every Wednesday overnight and **every other weekend**.

7. The existing parenting schedule was established at a time when **both parents resided in the Cambridge area**, within close proximity to Emily’s school, minimizing travel time and disruption.

8. The Defendant has now obtained a new employment opportunity and intends to **relocate to New Hampshire**, approximately ninety (90) minutes’ drive each way from Emily’s home and school.

9. The Defendant has expressed his desire to maintain the **identical midweek overnight schedule** despite this relocation.

10. If continued, the midweek overnight would require **extended travel periods**, including early-morning commutes that would significantly disrupt the child’s **education, sleep routine, and extracurricular enrollment**.

11. Emily, age 8, has begun to experience **anxiety and fatigue** related to the long travel required for her father’s parenting time since he began spending time at or near his new residence.

12. It is in Emily’s **best interests** that the midweek overnight be eliminated and that parenting time be adjusted to accommodate the new geographic realities and minimize disruption to her stability and well-being.

13. The change in Defendant’s residence and its logistical consequences constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the prior order, warranting review by this Court.

---

### **LEGAL STANDARD**

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify judgments concerning custody and parenting time “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

15. A party seeking modification must show both (a) a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the earlier judgment, and (b) that the proposed modification is in the **best interests of the child**.  
   See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Pierce v. Pierce*, 455 Mass. 286 (2009).

16. The Court has consistently held that fundamental changes in a parent’s location, employment, or the child’s schooling constitute adequate grounds for modification.  
   See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).

17. The Court must give paramount consideration to the **best interests of the child**, assessing stability, continuity, and daily routine.  
   See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

18. The child’s welfare is the “touchstone” of every custody determination. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

19. Massachusetts courts recognize that long-distance travel and disruption of schooling are not in a child’s best interest. *Cahill v. Cahill*, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 1126 (2008) (Rule 1:28 decision).

20. Pursuant to *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), the Court may adjust parenting time schedules to accommodate material changes in residence even absent bad faith.

21. Therefore, under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the above authorities, modification is appropriate and necessary to protect the health, education, and stability of Emily Johnson.

### **REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Sarah Johnson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. **Find** that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the custody order on April 15, 2021, due to the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire;

b. **Modify** the existing judgment to **eliminate the Wednesday overnight parenting time**, substituting a reasonable alternative that minimizes disruption (such as alternate weekend parenting time or extended school vacation time);

c. **Reallocate transportation responsibilities** in accordance with the parties’ new residences;

d. **Establish any other conditions** the Court deems proper to safeguard the best interests of the minor child, including adjustments to holiday or summer schedules if necessary; and

e. **Grant such other and further relief as is just and proper.**

---

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

The Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the prior judgment consistent with the foregoing requests, determining that continued midweek overnights are not in Emily’s best interests, and setting a new parenting schedule reflecting the changed circumstances.

---

### **VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE**

I, **Sarah Johnson**, hereby verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

  
Date: **December 1, 2025**  
Respectfully submitted,
