**LISA THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON**,  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7(b))

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Lisa Thompson**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **January 15, 2019**, concerning the minor child **Emma Johnson (age 8)**.  

In support thereof, the Plaintiff asserts as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Lisa Thompson**, resides in ____________, Massachusetts, and is the mother and primary custodial parent of the minor child, Emma Johnson.  
2. The Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, resides in **Cape Cod, Massachusetts**, and is the father of the minor child.  

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction properly lies with this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 & 6**, as this Court issued the existing custody judgment and retains continuing jurisdiction over matters concerning the care and custody of the minor child.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Barnstable Probate and Family Court**, as the Defendant now resides within this division and the existing order was entered by this Court.

---

## III. EXISTING ORDER

5. On **January 15, 2019**, this Court issued a custody order granting primary physical custody of the minor child to **Lisa Thompson**, with **Mark Johnson** receiving parenting time every other weekend and one mid‑week overnight on **Wednesdays**.  
6. At the time of the original order, both parties resided in the same town, approximately five minutes from the child’s school, making the mid‑week overnight practical and minimally disruptive.

---

## IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the January 15, 2019 order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** materially affecting the welfare of the minor child.  
8. Specifically, the Defendant relocated approximately **ninety (90) miles away**, from the child’s hometown to **Cape Cod**, Massachusetts.  
9. Despite this relocation, the Defendant continues to exercise the Wednesday overnight, which now involves approximately **three (3) hours of round‑trip travel** on either side of the school day.  
10. The child must wake around **4:30 A.M.** on Thursday mornings in order to return home in time for school.  
11. As a result, the child has become **chronically fatigued**, with diminished classroom participation, as observed and reported by her teacher.  
12. The current midweek arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the minor child, as required under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  
13. The child’s well‑being and educational stability are materially compromised by this disruptive midweek travel schedule.  
14. The best interests of the child would be promoted by eliminating the midweek overnight and adjusting the Defendant’s weekend parenting time accordingly.

---

## V. LEGAL STANDARD

15. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, “the Court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.”  
16. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that relocation or significant changes in a parent’s circumstances can constitute a **material and substantial change** justifying modification. See, e.g.:  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006) (material changes affecting a child’s stability warrant modification).  
   - *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (move rendering parenting schedule impractical constitutes material change).  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (relocation materially affecting child’s interests requires modification).  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003) (stability and continuity are central to best‑interest analysis).  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996) (court considers educational needs and emotional stability).  
   - *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998) (best interests must guide custody determinations).  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 493 (2012) (disruption to education and routine significant to child’s welfare).  
   - *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619, 625 (2000) (child’s well-being is paramount in any modification).  
   - *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (change in parents’ residences may justify adjustment in parenting schedule).  
   - *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 682 (2016) (best-interest test considers practicality and impact on child’s schooling).  

17. The facts here establish such a material and substantial change in circumstances and demonstrate that modification is necessary to protect the child’s welfare, educational engagement, and stability.

## VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

18. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
   a. Eliminate the Defendant’s **midweek overnight parenting time on Wednesdays**;  
   b. Permit the Defendant instead to have additional weekend or holiday parenting time as the Court deems appropriate, structured to minimize school‑night disruption; and  
   c. Make such further orders as are just and equitable to promote the best interests of the minor child.

---

## VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Lisa Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the prior judgment;  
2. Determine that modification of the existing custody and parenting schedule is **necessary and in the best interests of the minor child**, **Emma Johnson**;  
3. Issue a new parenting plan eliminating the mid‑week overnight with adjustments to ensure continued meaningful contact between the child and her father; and  
4. Grant such additional relief as justice and equity may require.
