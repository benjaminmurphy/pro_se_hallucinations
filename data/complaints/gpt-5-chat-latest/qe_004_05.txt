---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Maria Gonzales**, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.  
2. The Defendant, **Steven Thompson**, is an individual who owns and manages the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as the property in question is located in Worcester County and the rental arrangement arose within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  
4. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court because the subject property is located in Worcester, Massachusetts.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the apartment located at **123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603**, for a monthly rent of **$1,200.00**.  
6. Beginning approximately three months ago, Plaintiff noticed mouse droppings throughout her kitchen area, an indication of an ongoing rodent infestation.  
7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of these conditions. Defendant responded by placing a few traps, which caught only two mice.  
8. Despite this, rodent droppings continued to appear regularly in the kitchen area.  
9. Plaintiff again notified Defendant, who replied that such problems were “normal for older buildings” and implied that improper housekeeping was the cause.  
10. Defendant subsequently arranged for an exterminator to make one visit, but no follow‑up treatments were performed.  
11. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building likely required a more comprehensive extermination treatment to eliminate the infestation effectively.  
12. Defendant refused to authorize further extermination services, stating that they were too expensive and unnecessary.  
13. As a result of the continued infestation, Plaintiff has been unable to enjoy the full, quiet use of her residence. She has been forced to discard approximately **$200** worth of food and purchase **$80** in new storage containers to protect her groceries.  
14. Plaintiff experiences anxiety and discomfort cooking or eating in her own kitchen due to persistent evidence of rodents.  
15. Defendant has been repeatedly informed of the continuing infestation but has failed to take adequate remedial measures to abate the conditions.  
16. The presence of rodents and unsanitary conditions render the premises unfit for human habitation and constitute a breach of Defendant’s obligations under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1–16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts carries with it an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, protecting tenants from serious interference with the use and enjoyment of their leased premises caused by the landlord.  
19. Defendant’s failure to properly exterminate, repair, and maintain the leased premises constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the property.  
20. Massachusetts courts recognize that unsanitary or unsafe conditions, especially involving vermin infestation, violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  
21. Defendant’s failure to maintain sanitary and habitable conditions breaches the implied warranty of habitability and evidences a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
22. Under **M.G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, Plaintiff is entitled to assert this claim due to the existence of conditions materially affecting health, safety, or well-being.  
23. Defendant’s persistent neglect and refusal to abate the rodent infestation constitute a “substantial interference” with Plaintiff’s use of the premises, thereby violating **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 101–102 (1982).  
24. The conduct described herein is comparable to that found actionable in *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), where persistent housing defects and landlord neglect constituted a breach of quiet enjoyment.  
25. Additional Massachusetts authority confirms that even omissions—such as failing to make essential repairs or address infestations—can breach the covenant. *See Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Trustees of Cambridge Point Condominium Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC*, 478 Mass. 697 (2018).*  
26. The Department of Public Health’s Sanitary Code, **105 C.M.R. 410.550**, requires landlords to maintain residential units free from rodent infestation. Defendant’s failure to do so constitutes a violation of law supporting Plaintiff’s claim.  
27. By his actions and inactions, Defendant has constructively interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of her home. *See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Lezberg v. Rogers*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1158 (1989).*  
28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages including but not limited to property loss, emotional distress, and interference with her peaceable possession of the premises.

### V. DAMAGES

29. Defendant’s violation of **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14** entitles Plaintiff to recover actual damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
30. Plaintiff seeks actual damages of **$280** for personal property loss and expenses, or, in the alternative, the statutory amount of three months’ rent (**$3,600**) as permitted under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, plus court costs.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Steven Thompson for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of her actual damages ($280) or three months’ rent ($3,600), whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs of this action and other relief as justice may require; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
