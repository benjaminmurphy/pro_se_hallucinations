### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”), by and for her complaint against Defendant Michael Adams (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.  

2. Defendant, Michael Adams, is an individual who also resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, in the adjoining duplex unit to Plaintiff’s residence.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in the Superior Court of Hampden County, pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as this action is civil in nature and the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  

4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Hampden County, Massachusetts, specifically at the property located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant share a common driveway at their duplex residence located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

6. Defendant habitually kept a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against a wooden fence directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s usual parking space in the shared driveway.  

7. Plaintiff repeatedly expressed concern to Defendant that the ladder, resting unsecured against the fence, posed a risk of falling, particularly during windy conditions.  

8. Defendant assured Plaintiff that he would secure or relocate the ladder but failed to take any action to do so.  

9. On or about March 15, 2023, during a period of strong winds, Plaintiff was backing her vehicle—a 2018 Toyota Camry—into the driveway.  

10. A sudden gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to fall over, striking Plaintiff’s vehicle, damaging the hood and windshield, and causing significant property damage.  

11. Plaintiff immediately informed Defendant of the incident, and the damage required Plaintiff to have the vehicle repaired, necessitating bodywork and windshield replacement.  

12. Plaintiff was required to pay her insurance deductible and incur rental car expenses while her vehicle was in the repair shop for approximately one week.  

13. Plaintiff has suffered property damage, out-of-pocket repair expenses, insurance deductible costs, and incidental losses as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE  

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, every person owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. *Janosky v. ABM Janitorial Servs.*, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 1105 (2014); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331 (1983).  

16. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in maintaining his property and equipment so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others lawfully present thereon. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

17. Defendant breached this duty by failing to secure or store the ladder in a manner that would prevent it from falling under reasonably foreseeable conditions, such as high winds. *Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc.*, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 637 (2002) (failure to take reasonable protective measures constitutes breach).  

18. Defendant knew or should have known that an unsecured aluminum extension ladder placed upright against a fence in an open driveway could fall and cause property damage. *Helfman v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co.*, 114 Mass. 385 (1873) (foreseeability governs negligence).  

19. Defendant’s failure to tie down, secure, or store the ladder properly created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm. *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996).  

20. Defendant’s conduct constituted a failure to act with the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances, thereby breaching his duty of care. *Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283*; *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained property damage to her vehicle and incurred financial losses, including the cost of repair, insurance deductible, and rental car expenses, all proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent acts or omissions.  

22. Plaintiff acted with reasonable care at all relevant times and in no way contributed to the occurrence or the resulting damages. *Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50 (1988).  

23. The elements of negligence—duty, breach, causation, and damages—are satisfied under Massachusetts common law. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  

24. Accordingly, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages sustained as a result of his negligence.

---

### V. DAMAGES  

25. As a result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Property damage to her automobile, including a dented hood and cracked windshield;  
   b. Costs of repair, including payment of her insurance deductible;  
   c. Rental car and incidental expenses; and  
   d. Emotional distress and inconvenience associated with the repair and loss of use of her vehicle.  

26. Plaintiff’s damages are reasonably estimated to exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Michael Adams on the claim of negligence;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to exceed $25,000;  
C. Award interest and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C;  
D. Award reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses as allowed by law; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
