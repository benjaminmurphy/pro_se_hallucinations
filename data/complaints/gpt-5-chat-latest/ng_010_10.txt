Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MIKE THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff, **Jessica Hart**, through this Complaint against Defendant **Mike Thompson**, alleges as follows:

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

1. This is a civil action arising from personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff as a result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to properly maintain and inspect a large, cracked tree limb on his property, which ultimately fell and struck Plaintiff on July 15, 2023, on Maple Avenue in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

---

### II. PARTIES

2. Plaintiff **Jessica Hart** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. She regularly walks near 45 Maple Avenue as part of her daily activities.

3. Defendant **Mike Thompson** (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, the owner and person in control of the property located at **45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts**.

---

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, § 4**, which grants the Superior Court jurisdiction over civil actions for damages in excess of $50,000.

5. Venue is proper in this Court under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, §§ 1 & 2**, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Berkshire County, and Defendant resides or transacts business therein.

---

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Defendant is the owner and person in control of the residential property located at **45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts**.

7. In front of Defendant’s property stands a large, mature maple tree, with branches extending over the public sidewalk.

8. For months prior to July 15, 2023, one of the major branches of that tree was visibly cracked, drooping, and posed a foreseeable risk of detachment.

9. Neighbors, including the Plaintiff, observed the defective and dangerous condition of the branch. Several neighbors informed Defendant of the condition and urged him to have the tree inspected or maintained.

10. Defendant acknowledged awareness of the branch’s condition and stated he would “deal with it in the spring,” yet undertook no remedial action.

11. On **July 15, 2023**, during a routine summer thunderstorm—an ordinary, foreseeable weather event in the region—the cracked limb snapped and fell onto the public sidewalk below.

12. At that time, Plaintiff was walking home along the sidewalk in front of 45 Maple Avenue carrying grocery bags.

13. The falling limb struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground and causing immediate pain and injury.

14. Plaintiff was transported for medical evaluation and treatment, where she was diagnosed with a **shoulder strain and multiple bruises**.

15. Plaintiff incurred **approximately $2,500** in medical expenses and lost **approximately $600** in wages due to inability to work during recovery.

16. Plaintiff has experienced pain, suffering, inconvenience, and emotional distress as a result of Defendant’s negligent maintenance of his property.

17. The storm conditions on July 15, 2023, were ordinary in character and not so extreme as to constitute a superseding cause or “act of God.”  

18. Defendant’s failure to inspect, trim, or remove a known dangerous limb constitutes a breach of his duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of his property, including vegetation that presents a foreseeable risk to lawful users of adjacent public ways.

---

### V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

20. Under **Massachusetts common law**, property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful users of abutting public ways to prevent foreseeable risk of harm arising from defective conditions on their property or structures overhanging the public way. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Foley v. Mattina*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (2016).

21. Defendant had a duty to inspect, maintain, and remedy the dangerous condition of the cracked and overhanging tree limb adjacent to the public sidewalk. *Corsetti v. Stone Co.*, 396 Mass. 1, 10 (1985).

22. Defendant breached that duty by failing to take reasonable steps to have the tree limb pruned, removed, or inspected despite actual and constructive notice of its hazardous state. *Wolfe v. Ford Motor Co.*, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 346 (1978); *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).

23. Defendant’s breach was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431*; *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002).

24. The harm to Plaintiff was foreseeable: a large, cracked, drooping branch over a sidewalk creates an obvious risk of injury to pedestrians. *Griffin v. General Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362, 366 (1980).

25. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under the **Massachusetts comparative negligence statute**, **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85**. Plaintiff was not negligent and, if contributory negligence is alleged, any such negligence was less than the negligence of Defendant.

26. Plaintiff’s damages include but are not limited to her medical expenses, lost wages, physical pain, mental suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986); *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540 (1982).

27. Defendant’s breach of duty is actionable negligence under Massachusetts law. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); *Cottam v. CVS Pharmacy*, 436 Mass. 316 (2002).

---

### VI. DAMAGES

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, incurred medical expenses totaling approximately **$2,500**, lost wages of **$600**, and endured pain and suffering, physical and emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

29. Plaintiff continues to bear ongoing discomfort and inconvenience as a result of the injury.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Hart** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;  
B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, together with statutory interest under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §§ 6B–6C**;  
C. Award costs of this action pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---
