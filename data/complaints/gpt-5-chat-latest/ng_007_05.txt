### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. On **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s minor son J.J. attended an after-school program operated by Defendant at 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA.  
6. Defendant publicly represented and advertised that children enrolled in the program would be **“supervised at all times”** by competent staff members.  
7. On that date, approximately twenty children were present in the gymnasium. Defendant assigned two staff members to supervise the group.  
8. One staff member left the gym to perform paperwork in the administrative office, leaving only one employee—who remained largely inattentive and distracted by her phone—to supervise the children.  
9. During this time, two older boys began playing a rough, tackle-style game on the hardwood gym floor.  
10. Several children warned the staff member, who responded dismissively, stating “boys will be boys,” and did not intervene.  
11. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to properly supervise, one of the older boys tackled J.J., causing him to strike his head hard on the floor and lose consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.  
12. J.J. was transported to the emergency room and diagnosed with a **concussion**. He required medical treatment, missed several days of school, and has experienced continuing symptoms and distress.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$4,500** in medical expenses and **$1,200** in lost wages while attending to his son’s recovery.  
14. Defendant knew or should have known that unsupervised or inadequately supervised physical activity by older children in a gym created a foreseeable risk of injury to younger children.  
15. Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in hiring, training, and supervising personnel responsible for child safety.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE
16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed a **duty of reasonable care** to supervise children entrusted to its care and to protect them from unreasonable risks of physical harm. See **Sharpe v. Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc., 401 Mass. 788 (1988)**; **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (1965)**.  
18. That duty arises from Defendant’s voluntary undertaking to provide organized, supervised childcare services. See **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37, 41 (2009)** (those undertaking custody of another owe a duty to exercise reasonable care).  
19. Defendant **breached** its duty by failing to maintain adequate supervision and by permitting dangerous horseplay among children in its care. See **Morgan v. Lalumiere, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986)** (foreseeability of injury determines duty to control children).  
20. Defendant’s acts and omissions constituted negligence as defined in **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which provides that a plaintiff may recover damages where the defendant’s lack of ordinary care causes injury.  
21. Defendant’s negligence was the **direct and proximate cause** of J.J.’s injuries and of Plaintiff’s resulting economic losses. See **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101 (1978)** (causation established where harm is foreseeable consequence of negligent act).  
22. Defendant failed to meet the standard of care required under **Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013)**, which holds that those supervising children must act reasonably to prevent foreseeable harm.  
23. The breach of duty was further contrary to the principles set forth in **Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983)**, recognizing that custodial institutions owe a duty to protect those under their supervision from foreseeable harm.  
24. Defendant’s conduct also violated the standards identified in **Hobson v. Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), 480 Mass. 1009 (2018)** (duty arises where relationship creates reliance on defendant for safety).  
25. Plaintiff has sustained damages in the form of medical expenses, loss of income, and emotional distress. See **Campbell v. City of Lynn, 430 Mass. 611 (2000)** (recovery for economic and noneconomic damages caused by negligence is permissible).  
26. As a **proximate result** of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff and his minor son suffered actual damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to exceed $50,000.  
27. Plaintiff also relies upon relevant authorities including **Toubiana v. Priestly, 402 Mass. 84 (1988)**; **Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston, 365 Mass. 320 (1974)**; and **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc., 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002)**, each affirming the principle that negligence liability arises where the defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care causes injury to a foreseeable victim.

### VI. DAMAGES
28. As a consequence of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff and his minor son have suffered:
   - Medical expenses: approximately **$4,500**;  
   - Lost wages: approximately **$1,200**;  
   - Pain, suffering, and emotional distress; and  
   - Other compensable damages to be determined at trial.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Ethan Johnson**, on behalf of his minor son, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;
