### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1.  The Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson** ("Mother"), brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, seeking modification of an existing custody and parenting time order entered by the Barnstable Probate and Family Court on **April 15, 2019**.

2.  The Defendant, **Michael Adams** ("Father"), is the other parent of the minor child, **Emily Adams**, age 8.

3.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 29 and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as the original custody judgment was issued by this Court and both parties continue to have significant connections to the Commonwealth.

---

**II. EXISTING ORDER**

4.  The current custody arrangement, as set forth in the Judgment of April 15, 2019, designates Mother as the primary custodial parent. Father has parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek overnight each Wednesday.

5.  At the time of the entry of the order, both parties resided in the same community, making the Wednesday overnight a brief commute to the child’s school the following morning.

---

**III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6.  Since the entry of the original order, **a substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred** within the meaning of *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010), and *Roe v. Roe*, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 967 (1990).

7.  Specifically, Father has relocated from the parties’ former town to **Cape Cod**, approximately ninety (90) miles away from the child’s school and Mother’s residence.

8.  Despite this significant change in geography, Father continues to exercise the midweek Wednesday overnight, which now entails picking Emily up from school, driving her ninety miles to his new home, and awakening her at approximately 4:30 a.m. for a return trip to school early Thursday morning.

9.  These early-morning trips result in fatigue, stress, and diminished school performance for Emily. Her teacher has confirmed a noticeable decrease in her participation and alertness on Thursdays following the overnight with Father.

10.  The material change in circumstances — specifically, Father’s relocation and the resulting disruption to Emily’s rest, schooling, and overall wellbeing — has rendered the current parenting schedule no longer in Emily’s best interests under *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), and *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).

---

**IV. GOVERNING LEGAL STANDARD**

11.  Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody or visitation order may be modified "if the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child."

12.  Massachusetts law provides that the **best interests of the child** remain the paramount consideration. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

13.  A substantial geographic relocation of a parent, when it significantly affects a child’s stability, school attendance, or wellbeing, constitutes a material change warranting review. *Signorelli v. Albano*, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 939 (1985); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

14.  The Court also has continuing jurisdiction to amend custody and parenting time to serve the child’s best interests. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

15.  The modification requested herein seeks to ensure Emily’s health, education, and welfare remain protected, consistent with *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) and *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

16.  The child’s fatigue, disrupted sleep, and compromised school performance following the weekly midweek commute further justify modification. Courts have repeatedly recognized that disruption to a child’s schooling and rest patterns is contrary to the child’s best interests. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).

---

**V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

17.  Mother respectfully requests the following modifications to the existing custody and parenting plan:

   a.  Elimination of the midweek Wednesday overnight visit, to be replaced with a brief after-school or evening contact on Wednesdays if feasible and if it does not disrupt Emily’s rest or school responsibilities;  
   
   b.  Adjustment of the weekend parenting schedule, if necessary, to preserve consistent and meaningful time between Father and Emily but without the long-distance overnight travel on school nights; and  
   
   c.  Any additional relief the Court deems just and proper to promote Emily’s best interests.

---

**VI. CONCLUSION**

18.  A substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred due to Father’s move to Cape Cod and the detrimental effects of the midweek overnight arrangement upon the minor child’s sleep, education, and welfare.

19.  Modification of the existing custody and visitation order is required to serve **Emily Adams’ best interests**, as contemplated by G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the precedent established in *Smith v. McDonald*, *Mason v. Coleman*, *Rosenthal v. Maney*, *Williams v. Massa*, *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, *Custody of Kali*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Murray v. Super*, *Hunter v. Rose*, and *Rolde v. Rolde*.

### WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1.  Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the April 15, 2019 Judgment;  
2.  Determine that modification of the parenting schedule is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Adams;  
3.  Eliminate the current Wednesday overnight;  
4.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems fair, just, and appropriate.
