The opinion explicitly concludes there was no actionable failure to remove, sand, or repair the hazardous icy condition because the ice was a natural accumulation that had not been changed from its natural state.

As has been discussed, however, the evidence indicates only that the ice on which the plaintiff fell was a natural accumulation. The situation is, therefore, governed by the Aylward decision, where there can be no liability because, as was said in Aylward, supra at 79, \u2018naturally accumulated snow and ice on property does not per se constitute a defective condition.\u2019\u2026 In conclusion, there was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably have concluded that an act or omission by the town changed the condition of the ice\u2026 Because such a conclusion is necessary in order to find liability, judgment for the town was required.\u201d}"
