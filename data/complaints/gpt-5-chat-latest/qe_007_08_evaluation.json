The court\u2019s analysis focuses almost entirely on the measure of damages for breach of the implied warranty of habitability in the context of a subsidized tenancy. Because the decision neither defines the scope of the covenant of quiet enjoyment nor explains that it covers substantial interferences caused by the landlord or acts the landlord authorizes or tolerates, it does not provide direct authority for the claimed proposition.",

The SJC holds that some degree of landlord fault (at least negligence with notice) is required for a quiet enjoyment violation and explicitly rejects automatic liability based solely on a statutory violation.

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

Instead, Berman holds that the tenant\u2019s rent obligation abates as soon as the landlord has notice of the breach, regardless of the landlord\u2019s fault or the reasonableness of its repair efforts.
