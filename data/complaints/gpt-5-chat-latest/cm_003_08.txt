**Jessica Sullivan,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Thompson,**  
Defendant.

### INTRODUCTION AND NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, §28 and c. 209C, §20, Plaintiff **Jessica Sullivan** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on **September 15, 2021**, in the above-entitled matter.  

2. The current judgment provides for **shared legal custody** of the minor child, **Ethan Thompson (born [DOB omitted for privacy], age 8)**, with primary physical custody to Plaintiff and scheduled weekend parenting time for Defendant **Mark Thompson**.  

3. Plaintiff seeks a modification of this custody arrangement on the grounds that **a material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the prior order, and that a modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the child**, consistent with governing Massachusetts law.

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, §28** (modification of judgments for custody and support of minor children), **M.G.L. c. 209C, §20**, and **M.G.L. c. 215, §6**.  

5. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court**, where the original order was entered and where the child continues to reside.

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6. On **September 15, 2021**, following a hearing on the merits, this Court entered an order granting shared legal custody of Ethan to both parents, with primary residency with the Plaintiff, and regular weekend parenting time for Defendant.  

7. At the time of that order, both parties were found to be stable, loving parents who could engage in cooperative co‑parenting.  

8. Since that judgment, circumstances have changed substantially.  

9. In recent months, **Ethan** has reported troubling observations from visits with Defendant, including that there are “special drinks” in Defendant’s home and that sometimes Defendant “can’t walk straight.”  

10. A **neighbor** who is aware of the parties’ shared-custody arrangement sent Plaintiff a **video recording** showing Defendant stumbling while getting Ethan out of the car late one evening, apparently under the influence of alcohol or another intoxicant.  

11. In addition, **Ethan’s school staff** have observed that he frequently arrives on Monday mornings appearing exhausted and withdrawn, raising concerns about his weekend environment.  

12. Plaintiff has acted promptly and appropriately upon learning of these concerns, seeking to limit unnecessary conflict while protecting her son’s wellbeing.  

13. Plaintiff believes these developments constitute a **material and substantial change** in circumstances since the prior order and demonstrate that the existing custodial arrangement no longer serves **Ethan’s best interests** as required by law.

### LEGAL STANDARDS

14. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, §28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody judgment upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances and (2) that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.  

15. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 845 (2003) (court must determine whether changed circumstances affect child’s welfare); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006) (trial courts have broad discretion to modify custody when the child’s safety and welfare are implicated).  

16. In **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985), the Supreme Judicial Court emphasized that the “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody modifications.  

17. **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 260 (2001) holds that deterioration in a parent’s conduct or lifestyle may constitute a material change warranting modification.  

18. The Court in **White v. White**, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 132 (1996) recognized that evidence of habitual substance abuse and its impact on the child’s environment justifies altering custodial arrangements.  

19. **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540, 544 (2010) instructs that a parenting plan should protect the child from exposure to unsafe or unstable conditions, even where the parent previously was fit.  

20. In **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488, 495 (2012), the Court reiterated that the Family Court's paramount duty is to act with the child’s welfare paramount over competing parental interests.  

21. See also **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (unreported changes in a parent’s stability warranted modification); **Adoption of Cadence**, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 452 (2012) (court may consider patterns of neglect or impaired parenting capacity); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405–06 (1981) (the court may order limitations on visitation to ensure a child’s safety).  

22. The Court may impose appropriate **conditions or supervised parenting time** under **M.G.L. c. 208, §28A**, and **Mass. Prob. Ct. Standing Order 1‑06**, to safeguard a child’s welfare during transitions.

### REQUESTED MODIFICATION

23. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the current custody order be modified as follows:  

   a. That Plaintiff **Jessica Sullivan** be granted **sole legal and physical custody** of the minor child, **Ethan Thompson**; or, in the alternative,  

   b. That Defendant **Mark Thompson’s** parenting time be **temporarily supervised** or subject to such conditions as the Court deems appropriate to ensure Ethan’s safety and welfare, including but not limited to abstaining from alcohol or intoxicants before and during visitation periods.  

24. Plaintiff further requests that the Court order any other relief necessary to protect the best interests of the child, including possible evaluation, substance abuse assessment, or parenting programs under the supervision of the Probation Department.  

---

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Sullivan** respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a **material and substantial change of circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the September 15, 2021 custody order;  
2. Enter a **Modified Judgment** granting Plaintiff sole legal and physical custody of Ethan Thompson;  
3. Alternatively, impose **supervised or conditional parenting time** for Defendant, with safeguards including sobriety requirements and scheduled visitation center supervision as necessary;  
4. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable in the best interests of the minor child.
