**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
**(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

Filed: December 1, 2025  
____________________________________  

### I. PARTIES
1. Plaintiff **Jessica Adams** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment #2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.  
2. Defendant **Mark Thompson** (“Defendant”) is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 21, as the amount in controversy is less than $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the property at issue is located within this Court’s jurisdictional district.  

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. Plaintiff has been a lawful tenant of Defendant since June 1, 2022, under a written lease agreement to rent the second-floor apartment at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), for $1,800 per month.  
6. The lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.  
7. Around June 1, 2025, tenants moved into the third-floor apartment in the same building.  
8. Since moving in, those tenants have repeatedly engaged in excessive noise, including stomping, loud music late at night, and moving furniture during overnight hours.  
9. Plaintiff made multiple good-faith efforts to resolve the issue directly with the upstairs tenants, who temporarily reduced their noise before resuming their disruptive behavior.  
10. Plaintiff notified Defendant at least five to six times between July 2025 and October 2025 of the ongoing disturbances and requested intervention.  
11. Defendant failed to take reasonable or effective action to address the noise, stating he “can’t control how people live,” and thereby allowed the interference to continue.  
12. As a result of the ongoing disturbances, Plaintiff has suffered substantial loss of sleep, stress, and a reduction in her ability to peacefully occupy her home.  
13. Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses, including approximately $40 per month for prescribed sleep medication and costs for noise-mitigation equipment such as earplugs and a white noise machine.  
14. Plaintiff also received a written warning from her employer for falling asleep at work due to sleep deprivation caused by the interference.  
15. These conditions and Defendant’s failure to remedy them have substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

16. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of his premises.”  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease in Massachusetts. *See* **Winchester v. O’Brien**, 266 Mass. 33, 36 (1929); **Davis v. Comerford**, 483 Mass. 164, 167 (2019).  
19. The statute provides for actual and consequential damages, including three months’ rent or three times the tenant’s actual damages, whichever is greater.  
20. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable measures to address repeated, severe disturbances caused by other tenants under his control constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 718–20 (1977) (landlord liable where tenants’ conduct foreseeably caused noise disturbance); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982) (same).  
21. Defendant’s inaction amounts to an “indirect interference” prohibited by statute. *See* **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); *see also* **Berman v. Linnane**, 434 Mass. 301, 303 n.4 (2001) (covenant of quiet enjoyment breached by interference attributable to landlord’s failure to act).  
22. Plaintiff’s deprivation of peaceful habitation constitutes the “substantial interference” required for statutory liability. *See* **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982); **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  
23. Plaintiff’s damages include excessive noise exposure, loss of sleep, mental anguish, workplace performance issues, and out-of-pocket medical and mitigation expenses.  
24. Plaintiff estimates that her actual damages total approximately **$2,500**, and she seeks recovery of statutory triple damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
25. Defendant’s conduct was willful and in disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory rights, warranting an award of treble damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees. *See* **Cruickshank v. Dukakis**, 840 F.2d 1020, 1026 (1st Cir. 1988); **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1987).  

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Adams respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, consisting of three times her actual damages, or three months’ rent (3 × $1,800 = $5,400), whichever is greater;  
C. Award additional consequential damages in the amount of $2,500 or such other amount as the Court deems just;  
D. Award Plaintiff her costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees as mandated by statute;  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems equitable and proper.  

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
