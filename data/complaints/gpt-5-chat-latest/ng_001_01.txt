### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On **September 16, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee shopping in the dairy aisle of Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Dairy Ave, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

6. As Plaintiff traversed the aisle, she stepped into a substantial puddle of spilled milk on the floor. There were visible **shopping cart tracks** through the puddle, indicating it had been present for several minutes.  

7. There were **no warning signs, cones, or other notices** alerting customers of the dangerous condition.  

8. A store employee was stationed approximately fifteen (15) feet away stocking shelves and admitted, after Plaintiff fell, that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but intended to finish his stocking before retrieving cleaning supplies.  

9. As Plaintiff stepped into the puddle, she lost her footing and fell hard onto her right side, striking her **hip** on the floor surface.  

10. Plaintiff was initially shaken but completed her shopping. Later that evening, she experienced increasing hip pain and sought medical attention at a local urgent care clinic the following day.  

11. Medical personnel diagnosed **a hip sprain**, for which Plaintiff underwent several sessions of physical therapy.  

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses and lost approximately **$1,800** in wages due to her inability to work at her café job for several shifts.  

13. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent discomfort in her hip, has endured pain and inconvenience, and suffered disruption to her normal activities.

### **COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a **duty of reasonable care** to maintain the premises in a safe condition and to protect her against dangers of which Defendant knew or should have known. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  

16. Defendant further had a duty under Massachusetts law to inspect and remedy hazards or, where immediate remediation was not possible, to warn invitees of such hazards. *See* **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780, 783‑84 (2007); **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  

17. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to timely clean or warn of the spilled milk despite actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. *See* **Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.**, 332 Mass. 560 (1955); **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988).  

18. The employee’s statement that he had observed the spill “a few minutes ago” constitutes actual knowledge of the hazard, and Defendant’s failure to act promptly constitutes negligence. *See* **Palmisciano v. Thomas**, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 522, 526 (2002).  

19. Defendant’s conduct falls below the standard of care required by law for operators of business premises open to the public and violates its common‑law duty of reasonable maintenance. *See* **Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.**, 400 Mass. 837, 842‑43 (1987).  

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, economic losses, and emotional distress. *See* **Graves v. General Ins. Corp.**, 344 Mass. 505 (1962).  

21. Massachusetts law expressly recognizes a plaintiff’s right to recover for pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages proximately caused by a defendant’s negligence. *See* **G.L. c. 231, §85**, **G.L. c. 231, §6F**, *and* **O'Connor v. Raymark Indus., Inc.**, 401 Mass. 586 (1988).  

22. Defendant’s negligence was both the factual and legal cause of Plaintiff’s damages within the meaning of *Restatement (Second) of Torts §431*, as adopted in Massachusetts law. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006).  

23. Plaintiff bears no comparative fault; she acted reasonably and was unaware of the dangerous condition. Even if some comparative negligence were found, her recovery would remain available under **G.L. c. 231, §85** so long as her fault does not exceed that of Defendant. *See* **Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.**, 403 Mass. 50, 60 (1988).

   b. Medical expenses totaling approximately **$1,200**;
