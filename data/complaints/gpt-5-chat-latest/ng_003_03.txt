### **IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was an invitee and lawful customer on Defendant’s retail premises at **123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts**.  

7. The Defendant, through its agents, servants, and employees, had stacked large and heavy boxes of kitchen appliances on tall shelving units, approximately five to six boxes high.  

8. These stacks were **unsupported by straps, barriers, or safety mechanisms**, creating a foreseeable risk that they could topple or fall if the shelving was bumped or jostled.  

9. While Plaintiff was examining kitchen products, another customer’s shopping cart lightly struck a lower shelf.  

10. That minor contact caused a large toaster‑oven box to fall from an upper shelf, striking Plaintiff on the shoulder and side of the head.  

11. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and pain, and store management completed an incident report.  

12. Defendant’s manager offered Plaintiff a store coupon rather than medical assistance.  

13. Later that day, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, and he was examined at a local emergency department. Physicians diagnosed a **mild concussion and shoulder strain**.  

14. Plaintiff incurred **approximately $1,500** in medical expenses and lost **approximately $800** in wages from his employment as a delivery driver.  

15. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain and limitation of mobility in his right shoulder.  

16. Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages were the **direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence** in maintaining its premises in an unsafe condition for customers.

### **V. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE**

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–16 above as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a **duty of reasonable care** to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect against foreseeable risks of harm.  
   *See* *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371–72 (2010).

19. Defendant breached that duty by (a) improperly stacking heavy merchandise on high shelves, (b) failing to use restraints, guards, or warning signs, and (c) failing to inspect or correct a dangerous condition of which it knew or should have known.  
   *See* *Bowers v. P. Wile’s, Inc.*, 475 Mass. 34, 38 (2016); *Schulze v. Town of Winchester*, 410 Mass. 431, 434 (1991).

20. Defendant’s employees and agents knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that unrestrained stacks of heavy boxes in customer aisles created an unreasonable risk of injury.  
   *See* *Deagle v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

21. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent falling merchandise, contrary to accepted retail safety practices.  
   *See* *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).

22. Defendant’s conduct constituted **negligence** under Massachusetts common law and **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 283 & 343 (1965)**.

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. bodily injury (concussion and shoulder strain);  
   b. pain and suffering;  
   c. lost wages and diminished earning capacity; and  
   d. medical expenses.  
   *See* *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267 (1986); *Griffin v. General Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362, 367 (1980).

24. Defendant’s failure to maintain its premises violated the standard of reasonable care required under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which compares negligence of the parties. Plaintiff’s comparative fault, if any, was less than that of Defendant.

25. Defendant is therefore liable to Plaintiff for all damages permitted under **Massachusetts law**, including compensatory damages for injuries, medical costs, lost income, and general damages for pain and suffering.  
   *See* *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84, 88 (1988); *Donovan v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.*, 455 Mass. 215, 228 (2009).

   - Medical expenses: approximately **$1,500**;  
   - Lost wages: approximately **$800**;  
   - Pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience.  

27. Plaintiff seeks all compensatory damages recoverable under Massachusetts common law and statute, including prejudgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Marcus Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter **judgment** in his favor and against Defendant for an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, together with statutory interest and costs;
