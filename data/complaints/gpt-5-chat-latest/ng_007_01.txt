**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s minor son J.C., age eight, was enrolled in and attending an after-school program operated by the Defendant at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

6. Defendant represented to the public, including Plaintiff, that all children attending its after-school program would be *appropriately supervised at all times* while participating in activities at the community center, including while playing in the gymnasium.

7. At the time of the incident, Defendant had two staff members assigned to supervise approximately twenty children during gym activity.

8. One of those staff members left the gym to perform paperwork in an office, leaving only one individual present to supervise the group of children.

9. The remaining staff member was inattentive, sitting near the bleachers and looking at her cell phone for an extended period.

10. During this time, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began roughhousing and engaging in tackle-style play on the hardwood gym floor.

11. Several children notified the staff member of the unsafe behavior, but she failed to take any corrective action, responding only with, “boys will be boys.”

12. Moments later, one of the larger boys tackled J.C., who is small for his age, causing him to fall and strike his head forcefully on the gym floor.

13. J.C. lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and required emergency medical attention.

14. He was transported to a local emergency room and diagnosed with a concussion.

15. J.C. missed several days of school and follow-up appointments were necessary to monitor and treat his concussion symptoms.

16. Plaintiff incurred **approximately $3,500** in medical expenses associated with his son’s injury.

17. The injury, pain, and disruption caused significant distress to J.C. and emotional anguish to his family.

18. The harm to J.C. was a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to provide adequate supervision and failing to maintain a safe environment for minor children under its care.

**V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

19. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully restated herein.

20. Under Massachusetts law, the Defendant owed a legal duty of care to Plaintiff’s minor child to supervise him with reasonable attention and to protect him from foreseeable harm while he was in Defendant’s custody. See **Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc., 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1987)** (duty of care owed where relationship creates reliance on supervision); **Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47 (1983)** (institutions assuming supervision of minors owe duty of reasonable care).

21. Defendant also owed a duty under **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A(4)**, adopted in Massachusetts, recognizing a duty of custodians to protect those in their charge from unreasonable risk of physical harm.

22. Defendant breached its duty of care by:
   a. Failing to ensure adequate staffing and supervision of the gym area;  
   b. Allowing unsafe and aggressive behavior to continue unchecked;  
   c. Failing to respond to warnings by other children of dangerous play; and  
   d. Neglecting to follow its own stated policies requiring constant supervision of minors.

23. Massachusetts law recognizes that a party assumes a duty of reasonable care when it undertakes to supervise children. See **Doherty v. Belmont, 396 Mass. 271 (1985)** (school owes reasonable care in supervision); **Driscoll v. Worcester, 215 Mass. 493 (1913)**; **Brum v. Town of Dartmouth, 428 Mass. 684 (1999)** (foreseeability central to duty and breach).

24. Defendant’s conduct was unreasonable and negligent under the circumstances as defined by **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and fell below that level of care an ordinarily prudent entity would have exercised under like conditions. See **Ulwick v. DeChristopher, 411 Mass. 401 (1991)**.

25. Defendant’s failure to maintain proper supervision was the legal and proximate cause of J.C.’s injuries. See **J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio, Tort Law § 290 (3d ed. 2005)**; **Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995)** (causation established where harm is foreseeable consequence of negligent act).

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s minor child has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and mental distress, and Plaintiff has incurred financial loss due to medical expenses.

27. Massachusetts courts consistently recognize the right of a parent to recover for medical expenses incurred on behalf of a minor injured child under general negligence principles. See **Keenan v. Eli Lilly & Co., 418 Mass. 654 (1994)**; **Ferriter v. Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, Inc., 381 Mass. 507 (1980)**.

28. Defendant’s failures breached a duty recognized under Massachusetts common law and supported by **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6A & 85**, which require full compensation for harm caused by negligent acts.

---

**VI. DAMAGES**

29. As a direct result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:
   - Medical expenses in the approximate amount of **$3,500**;  
   - Emotional distress and mental suffering for Plaintiff’s son; and  
   - Loss of enjoyment of normal activities and educational disruption.

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jason Callahan, individually and as parent and next friend of his minor child, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Brockton Community Center;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably estimated at not less than **$3,500**, plus interest and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. Award such additional damages as are just and proper for Plaintiff’s son’s pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life;  
D. Award Plaintiff his costs in bringing this action; and  
E. Grant such further and other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.

---

**VIII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**
