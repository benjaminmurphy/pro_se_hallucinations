The court emphasizes that it is enough that the same general kind of harm (violent criminal misuse of a stolen gun) was foreseeable, even if the precise manner (shooting a police officer during a foot chase) was not, which aligns directly with the claimed proposition about type and manner of harm being foreseeable consequences of the defendant\u2019s actions.",
