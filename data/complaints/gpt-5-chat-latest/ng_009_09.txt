(Negligence)  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **David Martinez** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 3F, Lynn, Massachusetts 01901.  
2. Defendant **Lynn Apartment Management, Inc.** (“Defendant”) is a Massachusetts corporation with a principal place of business in Lynn, Massachusetts, engaged in the business of owning, operating, and managing rental properties, including the building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 231, § 1**, as the amount in controversy exceeds the District Court’s minimum jurisdictional threshold but does not exceed the statutory limit.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, because the cause of action arose in this judicial district, and Defendant conducts business and owns property in Lynn, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff resided on the third floor of the residential apartment building located at **123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts**, owned and managed by Defendant.  
6. Under **G.L. c. 148, § 26B**, property owners and managers are required to install and maintain operational smoke detectors in common hallways and living areas of multi‑unit dwellings.  
7. For several months before July 15, 2023, the smoke detector located in the common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment was nonfunctional and emitted a continuous “chirping” sound indicating a depleted battery.  
8. The battery was eventually removed, rendering the detector inoperative.  
9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the inoperative detector on at least three separate occasions, including in writing and by telephone.  
10. Despite these notifications, Defendant failed to repair or replace the smoke detector or take any other action to restore fire safety compliance.  
11. On or about **July 15, 2023**, a fire originated in a first‑floor apartment within the same building due to a kitchen accident.  
12. Because the smoke detector in the third‑floor hallway lacked a working battery, no alarm sounded to warn Plaintiff and other occupants.  
13. Plaintiff became aware of the fire only after smelling smoke, at which point the hallway was already filled with thick smoke.  
14. Plaintiff attempted to escape the building, suffering severe smoke inhalation and respiratory distress, requiring overnight hospitalization and medical treatment.  
15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$7,000** in medical expenses and lost **$2,500** in wages due to missed work.  
16. Plaintiff’s personal property sustained smoke and water damage, causing additional loss.  
17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the property, including all fire detection equipment, in a reasonably safe condition.  
18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to repair, replace, or maintain the smoke detector and by failing to comply with applicable fire safety codes and Massachusetts statutory requirements.  
19. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and losses.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I – Negligence**

20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 19 as though fully set forth herein.  
21. In Massachusetts, a landlord must exercise reasonable care to maintain common areas in a safe condition for tenants and lawful occupants. **See Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973); **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162, 163–64 (1980).  
22. Defendant’s failure to maintain operational smoke detectors constitutes negligence under **G.L. c. 148, §§ 26B, 27**, and **105 C.M.R. 410.482**, which impose duties to install and maintain functional fire protection devices.  
23. Massachusetts law recognizes a landlord’s liability for injuries resulting from unsafe or defective conditions in common areas that are under the landlord’s control. **Lindsey v. Massios**, 372 Mass. 79, 82 (1977); **King v. G&M Realty Corp.**, 373 Mass. 658, 659 (1977).  
24. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent property manager under similar circumstances. **See Glidden v. Maglio,** 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  
25. A violation of a statutory duty, such as failure to comply with **G.L. c. 148** or local fire safety regulations, constitutes evidence of negligence. **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990); **Guinan v. Famous Players‑Lasky Corp.**, 267 Mass. 501, 516 (1929).  
26. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. **See Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47, 51–52 (1983); **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 147 (2006).  
27. Plaintiff’s smoke inhalation, medical expenses, lost wages, and property losses were the foreseeable and direct results of Defendant’s failure to maintain fire safety equipment. **See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996).  
28. As a further matter, Defendant’s negligent conduct constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability as recognized in **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973), evidence of negligence and failure to maintain habitable premises.  
29. Plaintiff’s damages include but are not limited to:  
   a. Hospital and medical expenses: approximately **$7,000**;  
   b. Lost wages: approximately **$2,500**;  
   c. Property damage and personal losses due to smoke and water; and  
   d. Pain, suffering, and emotional distress.  
30. Defendant’s conduct directly caused the above‑described damages and proximately resulted in Plaintiff’s injuries.

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;

C. Award Plaintiff interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 261, § 1**;  
D. Grant such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
