      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not describe Thomas\u2019s \u201crepeated written and verbal complaints\u201d being ignored. To the contrary, the court repeatedly notes that Cruz Management made repeated, though negligent and ineffectual, attempts to repair and respond to her complaints. The case holds that negligent failure to adequately correct known defects can violate G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, but it does not frame the conduct as deliberate or reckless disregard based on ignoring complaints.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSince the evidence indicated that the ineffectual attempts were made to respond to the tenant\u2019s complaints, only negligent conduct was shown. In the judge\u2019s opinion, this was not sufficient to establish liability under \u00a7 14. \u2026 Cruz Management had notice of numerous sanitary, building and fire code violations in the apartment\u2026 It was wholly foreseeable \u2026 that the failure adequately to correct these violations\u2026 would impair substantially the value of the leased premises\u2026 On the facts found by the judge a violation of \u00a7 14 has been shown.\u201d"
