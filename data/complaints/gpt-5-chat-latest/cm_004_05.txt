### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, *Emily Johnson*, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and respectfully files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on **April 15, 2018**, concerning the minor child **Lucas Smith** (age 8). In support thereof, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 208, § 28**, which authorizes the Court to modify custody judgments upon a showing of changed circumstances.  
2. Venue properly lies in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court**, where the original custody decree was issued and where both parties and the minor child reside.  
3. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and Defendant, Michael Smith, are the lawful parents of the minor child, **Lucas Smith**, born in Massachusetts.

---

### II. PRIOR ORDER

4. On **April 15, 2018**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** awarding Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the minor child.  
5. The same order granted Defendant **three short midweek visits** and a **Sunday afternoon visit**, with **no overnight** parenting time, based primarily upon his then living situation—a single room within a shared apartment with unrelated roommates, which lacked adequate space for a young child.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. The law of the Commonwealth is well-settled that a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the child. *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
7. Since the entry of the 2018 judgment, there has been a **significant and material change** in the circumstances of the parties and the child, warranting modification.  
8. The child, **Lucas Smith**, is now eight (8) years old and attends school full time. At his current age and developmental stage, short midweek visits are disruptive to his academic schedule, homework, and bedtime routines.  
9. The Defendant, **Michael Smith**, has materially improved his living situation by securing **his own apartment with multiple rooms and a separate bedroom for Lucas**, eliminating the concerns that existed in 2018.  
10. The child has consistently expressed a desire to spend additional time with his father, including **overnight visits**, which the current order prohibits.  
11. Plaintiff and Defendant have **amicably co-parented** since the 2018 order, maintaining cooperative communication regarding their child’s education, health, and extracurricular activities.  
12. The Plaintiff believes that limited, structured overnight visitation will serve the **best interests of Lucas**, providing stability, balanced parental involvement, and reduced weekday transitions.  
13. The best interests of the child govern all custody determinations in Massachusetts. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
14. Continuing to enforce a visitation schedule based on circumstances that no longer exist would now be contrary to Lucas’s best interests and contrary to the principles of **G.L. c. 208, § 28**.  
15. Massachusetts law recognizes that as a child grows older, the parenting plan should evolve accordingly to suit changing developmental and practical needs. *See* **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Blixt v. Blixt**, 437 Mass. 649 (2002); **Miller v. Todd**, 952 N.E.2d 1005 (Mass. App. Ct. 2011).  
16. Both parents agree in principle that the present schedule should be modified to promote greater stability and consistent routines during the school week.  
17. The requested modification reflects not any parental misconduct but the **natural evolution of the child’s age, school responsibilities, and the father’s improved living conditions**, all of which materially alter the circumstances underpinning the 2018 Order.

---

### IV. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION

18. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court “may make a judgment modifying any earlier judgment as to custody or visitation if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  
19. Additional authority supporting this Court’s power and obligations in determining the best interests of the child includes:

   - **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** (applicable to parenting orders for unmarried parents);  
   - **G.L. c. 215, § 6** (granting Probate Court equitable jurisdiction);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981);  
   - *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981);  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   - *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976);  
   - *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649 (2002).  

20. Collectively, this legal authority supports a modification where a parent’s housing stability has improved and where the former schedule no longer serves the child’s emotional and developmental needs.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

21. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

   a. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the April 15, 2018 custody order;  
   b. Determine that a modification of the custody and parenting order is in the **best interests of the minor child, Lucas Smith**;  
   c. Modify the existing order to provide the Defendant, **Michael Smith**, with **over­night parenting time on alternate weekends**, from **Friday after school to Sunday evening**, and a **midweek evening dinner visit** on weeks when no weekend visit occurs;  
   d. Grant such other and further relief as may be just and equitable.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully prays that this Court:

1. Issue a modified custody order consistent with the foregoing;  
2. Confirm that such modification serves the best interests of Lucas Smith pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 208, § 28**;  
3. Grant any additional relief this Court deems just and proper.
