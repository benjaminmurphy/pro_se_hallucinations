**JORDAN TYLER,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**SOPHIA MARTINEZ,**  
Defendant.  

Civil Action No. ___________

---

### COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Jordan Tyler (“Plaintiff”), brings this Complaint against Defendant, Sophia Martinez (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), for violation of the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, **Jordan Tyler**, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  
2. Defendant, **Sophia Martinez**, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this matter involves a residential tenancy and alleged violations of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law occurring within Suffolk County.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court Department because the leased premises are located in Roxbury, within Suffolk County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **March 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent a **basement apartment at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119**, at a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. Plaintiff duly paid rent throughout the tenancy, except for a delay of approximately two weeks in October 2025, which was fully cured along with the late fee.  
7. In or around **November 2025**, Plaintiff began observing **water seeping through the basement wall** whenever it rained heavily.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message of the water intrusion. Defendant acknowledged receipt and stated she would “look into it.”  
9. Defendant took **no timely or effective action** to remedy the water infiltration problem.  
10. As the condition persisted, Plaintiff contacted the **City of Boston Inspectional Services Department**, which inspected the unit and confirmed the existence of **water penetration and other housing code violations**, in violation of **105 C.M.R. 410.000 (State Sanitary Code)**.  
11. The water intrusion caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, totaling approximately **$400**, and forced Plaintiff to operate a dehumidifier continuously, increasing electric costs.  
12. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant **failed to repair or mitigate** the condition in violation of her duty to maintain the premises in a habitable condition.  
13. Following the inspection and Plaintiff’s exercise of his rights under the housing code, Defendant labeled him a “problem tenant” and indicated she would **not renew the lease upon its expiration in March 2026**, asserting the prior late rent as a pretext.  
14. Defendant’s conduct—failure to address the water intrusion and retaliatory treatment following Plaintiff’s complaint—**substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises**.

---

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 14.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord is prohibited from “directly or indirectly interfering with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”  
17. Defendant’s failure to repair water infiltration, resulting in persistent damp conditions and damage to Plaintiff’s property, constitutes a substantial and unreasonable **interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** of the leased premises.  
18. Defendant’s actions and omissions are further prohibited under **Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), which holds that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached by any act or failure to act that materially impairs the character and value of the leased premises.  
19. Defendant’s retaliatory conduct, manifested by the threat not to renew Plaintiff’s lease following his lawful complaints to municipal authorities, also constitutes a violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 18** (retaliatory eviction statute), evidencing interference with quiet enjoyment as defined in **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
20. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a landlord’s **failure to correct sanitary code violations** may give rise to damages for breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).  
21. Additional authority recognizes that persistent water leaks and unremedied structural issues establish a breach even absent intent. See **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
22. The covenant of quiet enjoyment “protects tenants against acts or omissions by the landlord that impair the character or value of the leasehold.” **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
23. Defendant’s failure to act also violates the warranty of habitability recognized in **Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway**, supra, and the statutory obligations of landlords under **G.L. c. 239, § 8A** and **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
24. The conduct described, including code violations and retaliatory intent, collectively constitutes a continuing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses, inconvenience, emotional distress, and property damage.

---

### V. DAMAGES

26. Plaintiff has sustained actual damages in the amount of **$800**, consisting of $400 in property loss and approximately $400 in additional costs, discomfort, and loss of use.  
27. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant for **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **statutory damages equal to three months’ rent ($3,600)** or actual damages of $800, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff **reasonable costs** and any **attorney’s fees allowable under statute**;  
D. Order Defendant to **remedy all code violations** and **refrain from retaliatory non-renewal or eviction** in violation of G.L. c. 186, §§ 14 and 18; and  
E. Grant such **other and further relief** as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VIII. SIGNATURE

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025.**
