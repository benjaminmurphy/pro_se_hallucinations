**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28 & G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Samantha Reed**, and respectfully submits this **Complaint for Modification** of the custody order entered by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court on **April 15, 2021**, concerning the parties’ minor child, **Emily Turner**, age 8.  

Pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 208, § 28**, **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 209C, § 20**, and the controlling Massachusetts case law, Ms. Reed asserts that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the prior judgment such that modification of the current custody and parenting schedule is necessary for the best interests of the child.

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** under **G.L. c. 215, § 6** and **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, because the original custody judgment was issued by this Court and both parties and the child reside within or are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.  

5. Venue is also proper in this division under **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 4.2** and local probate jurisdictional rules.

---

**IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

6. The current custody arrangement was established by Order of this Honorable Court entered on **April 15, 2021**, in which Samantha Reed was awarded **primary physical custody** of Emily, and Kyle Turner was granted parenting time consisting of **Wednesdays overnight and every other weekend**.  

7. The schedule was negotiated and approved at a time when both parents lived in the **Cambridge, Massachusetts** area, and Emily attended school locally.

---

**V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the April 15, 2021 Order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** within the meaning of **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981), and **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

9. Specifically, the Defendant, **Kyle Turner**, now intends to **relocate to New Hampshire** for a new employment opportunity.  

10. This relocation would increase the travel time between households to approximately **ninety (90) minutes each way**, significantly affecting the practicality of the midweek overnight schedule.  

11. The current parenting schedule was crafted on the assumption of geographic proximity, which no longer exists.  

12. Because the existing custody order hinges on the parties’ residences being within close proximity to one another and to Emily’s school, the contemplated move materially undermines the functionality and stability of the schedule.  

13. Continued enforcement of the midweek overnight with such distance would cause Emily to endure extended commutes on school nights, resulting in early wake-ups, late returns, and disruption to her academic and extracurricular engagement.

14. These conditions have already resulted in **increased anxiety and stress** for the minor child, demonstrating that the prior arrangement is no longer consistent with her **best interests** as required by **Haas v. Puchalski**, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980) and **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

15. The child’s needs and daily routines must be prioritized under **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), which holds that custody and parenting orders should reflect the child’s welfare, academic stability, and emotional well-being.

---

**VI. APPLICABLE LAW**

16. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified if there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the last judgment and if modification is in the best interests of the child.  

17. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, the same standard applies to modifications of custody or parenting orders involving unmarried parents.  

18. Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly held that relocation of a parent or change in proximity constitutes a *material change* warranting review of custodial arrangements: **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Malachi M. v. Quintina Q.**, 483 Mass. 725 (2019); **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); and **Macri v. Macri**, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 362 (2019).

19. The controlling principle remains the child’s **best interests**, considering academic stability, continuity, and minimizing disruption—see **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); and **Williams v. Massa**, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).  

20. The relocation of one parent outside Massachusetts substantially impacts existing parenting arrangements and justifies modification when the current order becomes impractical or detrimental, consistent with **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), and **Mason v. Coleman**, supra.

---

**VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

21. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the April 15, 2021 Order as follows:

   a. **Eliminate the midweek overnight** on Wednesdays, in light of the Defendant’s relocation and the travel burden placed on the minor child.  
   b. **Adjust weekend parenting time** to provide Defendant with compensatory or extended time during school breaks, holidays, or alternating three-day weekends, as the Court deems appropriate.  
   c. Such further equitable relief as the Court finds just and proper to ensure continuity and stability for Emily Turner.

---

**VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Samantha Reed**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the prior custody order;  
2. Enter a **Modified Custody and Parenting Time Order** consistent with Emily Turner’s best interests, removing the midweek overnight and adjusting the weekend schedule to reflect the increased distance between households;  
3. Schedule a hearing on this Complaint; and  
4. Grant such other relief as this Court deems fit and proper.

---

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025.**
