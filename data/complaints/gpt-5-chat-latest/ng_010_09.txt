### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

**Plaintiff Emily Johnson**, by and for herself, brings this Complaint against **Defendant John Smith** for negligence and states the following:  

---

### I. PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 exclusive of interest and costs and the incident occurred in Berkshire County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about **August 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk adjacent to 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  

6. In front of said property stood a large, mature maple tree with a visibly cracked and drooping branch extending over the sidewalk area.  

7. For an extended period before the incident, the damaged branch was apparent to the Defendant and others in the neighborhood.  

8. Neighbors had warned Defendant that the branch appeared hazardous and suggested he retain an arborist to inspect it.  

9. Defendant acknowledged the condition, reportedly stating he would “deal with it in the spring,” but failed to take any remedial measures to remove or secure the limb.  

10. On the date of the incident, during a routine summer thunderstorm producing nothing more than moderate wind and rain typical for the area, the compromised branch broke and fell directly onto Plaintiff as she passed beneath.  

11. The branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground and causing her immediate physical injury.  

12. Plaintiff sustained a **shoulder strain and multiple bruises**, incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses, and suffered **$400** in lost wages due to one week of missed work.  

13. Plaintiff’s injuries and economic damages were the direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain the tree in a reasonably safe condition.

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful users of adjacent public ways to avoid creating or maintaining conditions on the property that pose an unreasonable risk of harm. **M.G.L. c. 231, § 85**; *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

16. The duty extends to natural or artificial conditions reasonably known to the landowner when such conditions abut public ways. *Sullivan v. Boston Gas Co.*, 414 Mass. 129 (1993); *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196 (1994).  

17. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the decayed tree limb presented a foreseeable risk of falling onto pedestrians. *Clough v. Bertuzzi*, 2008 Mass. App. Unpub. LEXIS 897; *Jones v. Hayden*, 310 Mass. 90 (1941).  

18. Defendant had a continuing obligation to inspect and maintain the tree in a reasonably safe condition. *Ferris v. Board of Health of Beverly*, 310 Mass. 243 (1941); *Doucet v. Winchester*, 233 Mass. 570 (1919).  

19. Despite actual and constructive notice of the defective condition, Defendant failed to act with reasonable care in pruning, removing, or otherwise safeguarding against the foreseeable risk the limb posed. *Carey v. Malley*, 327 Mass. 189 (1951).  

20. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable precautions constituted a breach of his duty of care. *Reynolds v. Waltham City Council*, 485 Mass. 116 (2020).  

21. Defendant’s breach was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting financial losses. *Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1990); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 323 (1965) (adopted in *Cottam v. CVS Pharmacy*, 436 Mass. 316 (2002)).  

22. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered pain, emotional distress, medical expenses, and lost wages, all in an amount to be proven at trial but believed to exceed **$25,000**.  

---

### V. DAMAGES  

23. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses for evaluation and treatment.  

24. Plaintiff missed approximately one week of employment, losing around **$400** in wages.  

25. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain and reduced strength in her injured shoulder, causing ongoing discomfort and diminished quality of life.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **John Smith**;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$25,000**;  
C. Award pre‑ and post‑judgment interest pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
D. Award costs and reasonable expenses under **M.G.L. c. 261, § 1**; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  

Pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
