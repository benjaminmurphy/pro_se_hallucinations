---

### I. PARTIES

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant **Mark Thompson** (“Defendant”) is an individual residing in Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, because the amount in controversy does not exceed the statutory jurisdictional limit of the District Court and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.  
4. The acts and omissions alleged herein took place within the geographic jurisdiction of the Newton District Court, located in Middlesex County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **May 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was jogging on a designated public jogging path within **Newton Park**, located at **123 Maple Street, Newton, Massachusetts**.  
6. The park contained posted signs stating, “All dogs must be kept on leash at all times.”  
7. Defendant was present that day with his large dog, which he regularly allowed to run loose in the park without a leash, contrary to said posted regulations and in violation of **Newton City Ordinance §§ 9-30 and 9-33**, as well as **G.L. c. 140, § 173**, which require dog owners to restrain their animals in public places.  
8. While Plaintiff was jogging, Defendant’s unleashed dog suddenly charged toward her, barking aggressively.  
9. Defendant stood approximately thirty (30) feet away, holding the dog’s leash over his shoulder, which was not attached to the animal.  
10. Fearing that the dog was about to bite her, Plaintiff instinctively turned off the pathway to avoid contact.  
11. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped over a partially exposed tree root and fell down a small embankment, suffering a **fractured wrist** and other physical injuries.  
12. The dog did not bite or otherwise make physical contact with Plaintiff, but the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries was her reasonable effort to avoid being attacked by Defendant’s negligently uncontrolled dog.  
13. Several other joggers witnessed the incident and can attest that Defendant’s dog was unleashed and that Defendant was inattentive at the time.  
14. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment, incurred **approximately $3,500** in medical expenses, and lost **approximately $1,200** in wages while she was unable to work.  
15. Plaintiff also endured pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life, including missing a piano recital for which she had practiced extensively.  
16. Defendant owed a duty to the public, including Plaintiff, to control his dog and comply with applicable leash laws and ordinances.  
17. Defendant breached that duty by allowing his dog to roam freely without restraint.  
18. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and related damages.

### IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 as though fully set forth herein.  
20. Under **Massachusetts common law**, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care so as not to subject others to an unreasonable risk of harm. *See* **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)**; **Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)**.  
21. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to control his dog and prevent foreseeable harm. *See* **Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co., 407 Mass. 185 (1990)**; **Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47 (1983)**.  
22. Defendant’s failure to leash his dog constituted a breach of duty, violating both statutory and common-law standards of care. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355 (1990)** (violation of a statute or ordinance may be evidence of negligence); **Guinan v. Famous Players–Lasky Corp., 267 Mass. 501 (1929)**.  
23. The risk that an unleashed dog could frighten pedestrians or joggers, causing injury, is both *foreseeable* and *natural*. *See* **Leibovich v. Antonellis, 410 Mass. 568 (1991)** (foreseeable risk analysis applies to negligence), and **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996)**.  
24. Plaintiff’s reaction to avoid a perceived threat was reasonable under the circumstances, satisfying the legal standard of proximate cause as articulated in **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 296**, adopted in **Souza v. United States, 726 F.2d 49 (1st Cir. 1984)** (applying Massachusetts law).  
25. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries, including physical pain, medical expenses, and loss of income. *See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**.  
26. Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm sustained. *See* **Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312 (2002)**.  
27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical injury (fractured wrist and associated medical treatment);  
   b. Economic losses (approximately $3,500 in medical expenses and $1,200 in lost wages); and  
   c. Pain, suffering, and emotional distress.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Mark Thompson**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **compensatory damages** in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to exceed **$4,700**, plus fair compensation for pain and suffering;

D. Award **costs of this action**; and  
E. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
