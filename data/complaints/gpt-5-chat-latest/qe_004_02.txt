**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)  
_______________________________________________________  

**Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”),** for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Smith (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:  

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 45 Brook Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.  
2. Defendant Michael Smith is an individual with a principal address upon information and belief at ______________________, and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (“the Premises”).  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in the Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19, as this action concerns a residential tenancy located within Worcester County and the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, §2 because the property at issue is located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business as a landlord there.  

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for the residential property located at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff has at all times paid rent in the amount of $1,200 per month and otherwise complied with all lease obligations.  
7. Around September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen, indicating a rodent infestation.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem by oral and written communication.  
9. Defendant responded by placing a few traps in the kitchen area but failed to take further effective measures after only limited success.  
10. Plaintiff continued to find rodent droppings weekly despite Defendant’s minimal efforts.  
11. An exterminator hired for a single visit informed Plaintiff that the building likely required comprehensive extermination treatment to eliminate the problem.  
12. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for further treatment, claiming that rodent activity was “normal for older buildings” and blaming Plaintiff’s housekeeping.  
13. Plaintiff maintains her kitchen in a clean and sanitary condition at all times.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered significant distress living in an unsanitary environment, has lost approximately $200 in contaminated food, and expended approximately $80 on storage containers to prevent further contamination.  
15. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a habitable and sanitary condition has rendered Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the property substantially impaired.  
16. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her rented home in violation of Massachusetts law.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs.  
18. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing that the tenant shall not be interfered with in her peaceful use and enjoyment of the premises by the acts or omissions of the landlord.  
19. Defendant’s failure to adequately address the rodent infestation constitutes a breach of this covenant.  

20. Massachusetts law provides that a landlord’s inaction leading to persistent unsanitary conditions or infestations interfering with the tenant’s comfort and safety amounts to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Youghal, LLC v. Entwistle*, 484 Mass. 1019 (2020).  

21. Defendant’s failure also violates the implied warranty of habitability recognized in *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and constitutes a dangerous or unsanitary condition contrary to the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and 410.600, which require landlords to maintain the premises free of rodent infestation.  

22. The interference was both substantial and unreasonable, and directly resulted from Defendant’s acts and omissions.  

23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a violation of G.L. c. 186, §14, entitling Plaintiff to recover actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.  *See* G.L. c. 186, §14; *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman*, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33 (1929); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Dolben Co. v. Friedmann*, 2004 Mass. App. Div. 41 (2004).  

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses totaling approximately $280, emotional distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of her residence.

---

### **V. DAMAGES**

25. Plaintiff seeks statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, in an amount no less than three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual damages ($280), whichever is greater, plus costs and attorney’s fees.  
26. Plaintiff further seeks all other relief deemed just and proper by this Court.

---

### **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE,** Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages in an amount equal to three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual damages ($280), whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff the costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees (should she retain counsel);  
D. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### **VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
