It does not involve minors, children, or any articulated duty to provide supervision commensurate with a child\u2019s age or activities.

Yakubowicz involves a movie producer and theater owner\u2019s alleged negligence relating to exhibiting a violent film and allowing a patron to consume alcohol, plus foreseeability of off\u2011premises violence. The court holds there was no breach of duty on these facts and does not address gymnasium supervision, older children\u2019s unsafe play, or ignoring prior warnings in a premises\u2011liability/supervision context, so it does not support the claimed proposition.",

The judge properly entered summary judgment for Saxon on this count on the ground that Saxon did not owe the decedent a duty to protect him from acts resulting from Barrett\u2019s self-induced intoxication."
