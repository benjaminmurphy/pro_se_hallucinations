# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

**Filed:** December 1, 2025

## **I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **Sara Mitchell** (“Plaintiff”), resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children **Emma Thompson**, age 10, and **Liam Thompson**, age 8.  

2. Defendant, **Kyle Thompson** (“Defendant”), also resides within Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

3. This Court entered an order on or about **March 15, 2022**, establishing joint legal custody of the minor children, with primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and parenting time for the Defendant on alternating weekends and as otherwise agreed.  

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and related case law (see *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)).

## **II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS SHOWING A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

5. Since the entry of the March 15, 2022 custody order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children, as defined by **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

6. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities scheduled during Plaintiff’s court-ordered parenting time without first obtaining her consent or consulting her, contravening the spirit of joint legal custody.  

7. The Defendant has made statements to the minor children blaming Plaintiff for missed activities and characterizing her as “selfish” or “uncaring,” thereby disparaging Plaintiff to the children and undermining their relationship with her, contrary to the express provisions of the existing order.  

8. As a result, the children—particularly Emma—have exhibited signs of emotional distress, including stomach aches and anxiety on transition days. This demonstrates that the current arrangement is causing instability and emotional harm, circumstances that Mass. courts deem significant in modification proceedings (*Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)).  

9. The existing provisions for joint legal custody, though entered in good faith, are no longer serving the children's best interests because Defendant’s conduct has impeded cooperative decision-making, contrary to the standards articulated in *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

10. The pattern of non-cooperation constitutes a material change in circumstances under *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015), which held that persistent interference with a co-parent’s custodial relationship can justify modification.  

11. The children’s best interests and welfare are paramount to this determination (*Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003); *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981)).  

12. Plaintiff has maintained a stable home environment, continued the children’s schooling and extracurricular participation, and communicated consistently regarding their health and education, consistent with the standards established in *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

13. The current conflict has impaired the children’s emotional wellbeing, their sense of security in transitions, and their trust in both parents—factors heavily weighted in modification analysis (*Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986)).  

14. Plaintiff seeks to modify the existing custody order to ensure decisions are made in a cooperative, child-centered manner that prevents further emotional harm and preserves the children's stability and wellbeing.

## **III. APPLICABLE LAW**

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a custody order “upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.”  

16. Massachusetts courts have consistently required a two-part showing for modification: (1) a material change in circumstances and (2) that the proposed modification serves the children's best interests (*Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981)).  

17. Where parents with joint legal custody can no longer communicate or cooperate effectively, modification to sole legal custody is appropriate (*Rolde*, supra; *Mason*, supra).  

18. Stability and continuity in the children’s primary residence are determinative factors (*Custody of Kali*, supra).  

19. Emotional harm caused by parental conflict and disparagement may warrant modification to protect the children’s mental health (*Yannas*, supra; *Bouchard*, supra).  

20. The Court is authorized under **G.L. c. 215, § 6** to grant such equitable relief as may be necessary for the welfare of the children.

## **IV. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Sara Mitchell**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the Court’s March 15, 2022 custody judgment;  

B. Modify the existing custody order to grant **Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, sole legal and physical custody** of the minor children, **Emma Thompson** and **Liam Thompson**;  

C. Establish a clear schedule for Defendant’s parenting time that minimizes transition-related conflict and ensures both parents support the children’s relationship with the other;  

D. Provide that all major decisions regarding the children’s education, health, and extracurricular activities shall be made by Plaintiff after consultation with Defendant, but without the requirement of mutual consent;  

E. Order that neither parent shall disparage the other to or in the presence of the children; and  

F. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the children’s best interests.
