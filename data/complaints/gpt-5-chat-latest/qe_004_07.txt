(M.G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

## **INTRODUCTION**

This is a complaint brought by Plaintiff **Emily Johnson**, a tenant residing at **252 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605**, against her landlord, **Michael Thompson**, for breach of the statutory **covenant of quiet enjoyment** under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14**, arising from Defendant’s persistent failure to abate a rodent infestation that has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment of her home.

---

## **PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff Emily Johnson** (“Plaintiff”) is an adult individual residing at 252 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605. Plaintiff has continuously resided there pursuant to a written lease agreement beginning on or about **January 15, 2022**, and continues to rent the premises for **$1,200 per month**.

2. **Defendant Michael Thompson** (“Defendant”) is the owner and lessor of the premises located at 252 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605. Upon information and belief, Defendant resides in Massachusetts and transacts business as a landlord within Worcester County.

---

## **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 212, §3**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the Worcester District Court.  

4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court under **G.L. c. 223, §8**, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester County and the leased premises are located there.

---

## **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff began renting the apartment located at 252 Elm Street on **January 15, 2022**, from Defendant pursuant to a residential tenancy agreement.  

6. Beginning approximately in **September 2025**, Plaintiff noticed **mouse droppings and signs of rodent activity** in her kitchen.  

7. Plaintiff promptly reported these conditions to Defendant by direct communication and requested remedial measures consistent with the landlord’s obligations under **G.L. c. 186, §14** and **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, as well as the Massachusetts **State Sanitary Code**, **105 CMR 410.550**, which requires a landlord to maintain premises free from infestation.  

8. Defendant responded by placing a few traps and arranging for a single exterminator visit, but failed to implement comprehensive or continued treatment as recommended by the exterminator.  

9. Despite Plaintiff’s continued communications, the problem persisted, and mouse droppings continued to appear on a weekly basis.  

10. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns as “normal for older buildings” and took no further substantial measures to eliminate the infestation, thereby failing to provide habitable premises.  

11. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to, **approximately $200 in contaminated food losses** and **$80 in storage container expenses**, as well as **emotional distress, anxiety, and interference with daily living** caused by the infestation and Defendant’s inaction.  

12. The conditions materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the apartment, and Defendant’s failure to remedy the infestation constitutes a **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment** implied and imposed under **Massachusetts law**, specifically **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

## **CAUSE OF ACTION**

### **Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord is prohibited from directly or indirectly interfering with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises. The statute provides a civil remedy for tenants where the landlord’s acts or omissions cause a material interference with the tenant’s use of the property.  

15. The **failure to maintain residential premises in a habitable condition**, including the presence of rodents, constitutes a material interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 101–02 (1982); **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977).  

16. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that a **landlord’s failure to correct unsanitary or unsafe conditions**—including infestations—violates both the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855, 871 (1991); **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 197–200 (1973).  

17. Defendant’s actions and omissions, including his failure to provide adequate extermination and to maintain sanitary conditions, constitute a **constructive interference** with Plaintiff’s tenancy in violation of **G.L. c. 186, §14**. See also **Winchester v. J.W. R. Co., Inc.**, 371 Mass. 641, 646 (1976); **Mescall v. Somerset Properties Co.**, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 104 (1984).  

18. Plaintiff’s loss of use and enjoyment is further supported by the requirement under the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 CMR 410.550**, that “the owner shall maintain the dwelling free from rodents, insects, and other pests,” and **failure to comply** constitutes a breach of both **statutory and common-law duties**. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 201 (1979); **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1987).  

19. Defendant’s conduct was willful, knowing, and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, justifying the imposition of statutory damages and attorney’s fees under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered **monetary damages, discomfort, distress, and loss of enjoyment of her home**.

---

## **DAMAGES**

21. Plaintiff has suffered at least **$280** in direct out-of-pocket expenses for food loss and storage materials, along with **non-economic damages** including emotional distress, annoyance, and interference with normal life functions associated with the repeated rodent infestation.  

22. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, as well as **reasonable attorney’s fees and costs**.  

Given the monthly rent of **$1,200**, Plaintiff seeks **three months’ rent ($3,600)** as statutory damages, plus **costs**.

---

## **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in her favor on all counts;  
B. Award statutory damages under **G.L. c. 186, §14** in the amount of **three months’ rent ($3,600)** or actual damages, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff **costs of this action**;  
D. Grant **such further relief** as this Court deems just and proper.

---

## **JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
