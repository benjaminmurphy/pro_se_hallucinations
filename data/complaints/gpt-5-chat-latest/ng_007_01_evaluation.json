It does not discuss, recognize, or analyze any general Massachusetts common\u2011law principle that an actor who undertakes to supervise children thereby assumes a duty of reasonable care. Supervision of children is mentioned only factually in the school setting, not as a doctrinal basis for imposing a duty of care, so this case does not support the proposition cited.",

Instead, the Supreme Judicial Court holds that Westwood owed no duty to provide safe passage across the state highway, that its only voluntarily assumed duty (hiring police for traffic control) was performed with due care, and that the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the city shows the officer was not negligent. Thus, the court rejects, rather than affirms, any theory that Westwood\u2019s supervision or lack thereof legally and proximately caused the injuries.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn this case, Westwood voluntarily undertook one specific task, that of hiring police officers to direct pedestrians across Route 1A between the south parking lot and the track. Thus, Westwood was cast with a duty to exercise due care in carrying out the particular task of hiring those officers. \u2026 [T]he jury verdict that the city of Revere was not negligent supports the conclusion that Westwood performed this duty with due care\u2026 Hence, even if we were to assume that Officer Falzarano was Westwood\u2019s agent, there is no ground for attributing to Westwood vicarious liability for his acts.\u201d"
