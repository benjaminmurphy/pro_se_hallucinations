------------------------------------------------------------  
**Emily Johnson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.                                                    Civil Action No. _______

**Mark Thompson,**  
Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------------

### **COMPLAINT**

**Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”)** brings this action against her landlord, **Mark Thompson (“Defendant”)**, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws and established caselaw.  

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.  
2. Defendant **Mark Thompson** is an individual with an address believed to be in Hampden County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and landlord of the subject premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (“the Premises”).

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**.  
4. Venue is proper in Hampden County under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the Premises are located in Springfield, and the acts and omissions giving rise to this complaint occurred within this county.  

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **May 1, 2021**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, for **$1,400 per month**.  
6. Since the commencement of her tenancy, Plaintiff has paid all required rent and has materially complied with all terms of the lease and with her statutory duties as a tenant.  
7. Beginning approximately six weeks ago, one of the two bedrooms in the apartment lost electrical service completely. The outlets stopped functioning, and the overhead light no longer operated.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical outage.  
9. Defendant sent an electrician who determined that the wiring problem would require a substantial repair.  
10. Defendant informed Plaintiff that he was “getting quotes” but that the repair was “complicated” due to the age of the building’s wiring.  
11. Since that time, Defendant has failed to make any effective repair or restoration of electrical service to the affected bedroom.  
12. Plaintiff has been unable to use that bedroom for any of its intended purposes, including use as a home office.  
13. As a result, Plaintiff has been forced to incur additional expenditures, including approximately **$15 per day** for coffee shops and meals while working outside the home, and a **$150 per month coworking membership**.  
14. The lack of electricity has rendered one of the two bedrooms unusable, materially interfering with Plaintiff’s right to enjoy and use her leased premises.  
15. The condition has continued for a period of approximately six weeks and persists as of the date of this complaint.  
16. Defendant has failed to act with reasonable promptness to correct the known defect, despite his legal obligations to maintain the premises in habitable condition and free from conditions interfering with quiet enjoyment.  

---

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, and any such interference constitutes a violation entitling the tenant to actual and statutory damages.  
19. The statute imposes liability where the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.  
20. Defendant, by failing to timely repair and restore electrical service to one of Plaintiff’s two bedrooms, has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home.  
21. Defendant was notified of the defective condition, had the ability to correct it, and unreasonably failed to do so for more than six weeks.  
22. The lack of adequate electric service renders a portion of the apartment uninhabitable and materially impacts Plaintiff’s living conditions and use of space.  
23. Defendant’s inaction constitutes a constructive eviction from part of the premises and a continuing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized under Massachusetts law.  

---

### **V. LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES**

24. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law in all residential leases in Massachusetts. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
25. A landlord violates the covenant where his or her conduct, or failure to act, “substantially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment.” **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
26. Liability under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** may arise from inaction or neglect where the landlord allows uninhabitable conditions to persist. See **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
27. The existence of defective electrical wiring is a material defect affecting habitability under **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, **105 C.M.R. 410.351**, and **410.750**, which require landlords to maintain electrical systems in good repair.  
28. The landlord’s failure to remedy known defects may constitute interference under **Lipsitt v. Plaud**, 466 Mass. 240 (2013)**, and **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991)**.  
29. The covenant also protects the tenant’s right to freedom from substantial interference caused by the landlord’s neglect. See **Winchester v. O’Brien**, 266 Mass. 33 (1929); **Tripp v. Keith**, 217 Mass. 164 (1914)**.  
30. Plaintiffs in similar cases have recovered damages for loss of use of part of the premises and consequential damages. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005)**.  
31. Defendant’s continuing failure to restore electrical service and habitability violates these statutory and common-law protections.

### **VI. DAMAGES**

32. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Loss of use of one bedroom for at least six weeks;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses of approximately **$15/day** to work outside her home;  
   c. Membership fees for alternative workspace totaling approximately **$150 per month**;  
   d. Diminished value and use of the leased premises.  
33. Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of **$1,200**, representing her actual losses and the diminished enjoyment of her tenancy, as well as reimbursement of reasonable costs, attorney’s fees (as permitted by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**), and any other statutory relief.

### **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on the claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **actual and statutory damages** in the amount of **$1,200** or such other amount as the Court deems just and proper;  
C. Award **reasonable attorney’s fees and costs** as provided by statute;  
D. Grant **any other relief** the Court deems just and equitable to redress the Defendant’s violations; and  
E. Retain jurisdiction over this matter as necessary to enforce the judgment.  

---

### **VIII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
