Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor (“Plaintiff”),** and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20;* and *Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7*, for a modification of the existing custody order entered by this Court on **June 15, 2020**, involving the minor child, **Emily Johnson (age 10)**. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Taylor**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the primary residential parent of the minor child under the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan entered on **June 15, 2020**.

2. The Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and exercises parenting time with the minor child pursuant to the aforesaid judgment.

3. The parties share joint legal custody pursuant to the current Judgment.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20;* and *G.L. c. 215, § 6.*

5. Venue properly lies in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court**, where the original custody judgment was entered and the minor child resides.

---

### III. RELEVANT BACKGROUND AND CURRENT COURT ORDER

6. On **June 15, 2020**, the Court entered a custody and parenting time order providing for **joint legal custody** of the minor child, **Emily Johnson**, with the Plaintiff as the *primary residential parent*.

7. Pursuant to that order, the Defendant is granted *substantial weekend parenting time*, including overnight stays on Sunday, and both parties are required to *cooperate on school matters* and *keep each other informed* regarding the child’s educational progress.

8. At the time the order was entered, the child was attending school consistently, performing well academically, and there were no concerns relating to truancy or missed instructional time.

---

### IV. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SINCE THE ENTRY OF THE PRIOR JUDGMENT

9. Since the entry of the June 15, 2020 Order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** materially affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child.

10. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly kept the minor child home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, asserting that the child “needs a mental health day.”

11. These absences are *unauthorized* and *unexcused*; no medical documentation or doctor’s note has been provided to justify these absences.

12. As a result of these repeated absences, the Plaintiff has received *truancy warnings* from the child’s school and/or school district.

13. The minor child’s grades and standardized test scores have fallen markedly, which represents a significant decline from her prior academic standing.

14. The Defendant has also refused or failed to transport the child to scheduled tutoring sessions during his weekend parenting time, further impairing her educational progress.

15. The Plaintiff has made numerous good-faith attempts to communicate and cooperate with the Defendant regarding school attendance, academic performance, and tutoring, but these efforts have not resulted in compliance or improvement.

16. The continued pattern of school absences, the educational decline, and the Defendant’s unwillingness to prioritize the child’s attendance and academic needs constitute a **material change of circumstances** under Massachusetts law.

---

### V. LEGAL STANDARD AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITY

17. Pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28,* a custody order “may be modified if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”

18. Massachusetts law requires both a material change in circumstances and a showing that modification serves the child’s best interests. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *G.L. c. 208, § 28.*

19. The “best interests of the child” standard remains the paramount consideration. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

20. The Court has recognized that a substantial change in a child’s schooling or welfare can justify modification of custody. *See* **Anderson v. Anderson**, 407 Mass. 251 (1990); **Custody of Sorrel**, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (1998).

21. A parent’s failure to foster a child’s education has been deemed a sufficient change in circumstance to warrant modification of custody or parenting time. *See* **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

22. Courts have further held that when one parent interferes with a child’s schooling, the Court may adjust custody or legal decision-making authority to protect the child’s educational welfare. *See* **Stevens v. Stevens**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 606 (1988); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

23. Under *G.L. c. 208, § 31*, joint legal custody determinations must reflect an ability of parents to cooperate and communicate; when that ability deteriorates, modification may be appropriate. *See* **Rolde**, supra; **Mason**, supra; **Yannas**, supra.

24. The Defendant’s consistent disregard for school attendance obligations demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to act in the child’s best interest, satisfying the “material change” threshold per *Smith*, supra, and *Anderson*, supra.

### VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Wherefore, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Taylor**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior judgment;

B. **Modify the existing custody order** to provide that the Plaintiff, **Jessica Taylor**, shall have *final decision-making authority* over matters relating to **school attendance and educational issues**, including tutoring and homework compliance;  
   **or**, in the alternative,

C. **Modify the parenting schedule** to remove or adjust the Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time, so that the child returns to the Plaintiff’s residence Sunday evenings to ensure school attendance Monday mornings;

D. **Order** any such further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the child pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and the relevant case law cited herein.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Accept jurisdiction over this Complaint for Modification;  
2. Schedule a hearing on the issues presented;
