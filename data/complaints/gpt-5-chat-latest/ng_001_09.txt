**EMILY THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**FRESH MARKET GROCERY**,  
Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
**Civil Action No. ___________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**

This is a civil action for personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, Emily Thompson, as a result of the Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, resulting in a slip-and-fall incident inside Fresh Market Grocery located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

**II. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Thompson** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and was lawfully upon the Defendant’s premises as a business invitee at all times relevant hereto.  

2. The Defendant, **Fresh Market Grocery** (“Defendant”), is a business entity organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or another jurisdiction, upon information and belief), engaged in the business of owning and operating a grocery store located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the matter in controversy exceeds $50,000 exclusive of interest and costs.  

4. Venue is proper in Middlesex County under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, because the Defendant operates the premises within Middlesex County, and the tortious conduct alleged herein occurred in Somerville, Massachusetts.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On **September 16, 2023**, Plaintiff was a customer lawfully shopping at Defendant’s store at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

6. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff slipped on a visibly large puddle of spilled milk present on the floor.  

7. There were cart tracks through the puddle, indicating the spill had been present for a period of time sufficient for Defendant’s employees to have discovered and remedied the condition through the exercise of reasonable care.  

8. No warning cones, “wet floor” signs, or other safety measures were in place to warn customers of the dangerous and slippery condition.  

9. A store employee standing approximately fifteen feet from the puddle admitted to Plaintiff after the fall that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but chose to finish stocking shelves before retrieving cleaning supplies.  

10. Plaintiff fell to the ground, sustaining a **hip sprain**, and later underwent medical evaluation and physical therapy.  

11. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately **$2,500** and lost wages totaling approximately **$1,200** due to missed work at her place of employment.  

12. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or remedy hazards of which it knew or should have known.  

13. Defendant and its employees breached this duty by failing to remove or warn of the spill when they knew, or in the exercise of reasonable inspection and maintenance procedures should have known, of its presence.  

14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, medical expenses, lost wages, and continuing pain and discomfort in her hip.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE**

15. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  

17. Defendant had a duty to maintain its premises in a condition reasonably safe for lawful visitors such as Plaintiff. See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 371 (2010); **Oliveri v. MBTA**, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  

18. Defendant breached that duty by (a) failing to timely clean up the spilled milk; (b) failing to place warning signs or cones despite actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition; and (c) failing to adequately train and supervise employees in maintaining safe store conditions.  

19. The Defendant’s constructive knowledge is established by the existence of visible cart tracks and its employee’s admission that the spill had been observed before the incident. See **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263 (1961); **Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co.**, 208 Mass. 273 (1911).  

20. Defendant’s failure to act with reasonable promptness constitutes negligence under well-established Massachusetts premise liability law. See **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007); **Gallagher v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.**, 332 Mass. 560 (1955).  

21. Massachusetts applies the standard of reasonable care toward all lawful visitors regardless of classification. See **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).  

22. The Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Proximate cause is established when the injury is a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s breach of duty. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); **Bernier v. Boston Edison Co.**, 380 Mass. 372 (1980).  

23. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained pain and suffering, incurred medical costs, lost income, and continues to experience physical discomfort and limitations.  

24. Plaintiff seeks all appropriate damages under **G.L. c. 231, § 85** and applicable common law principles. Contributory negligence, if any, shall not bar recovery but shall diminish damages in proportion to Plaintiff’s comparative fault, if proven.  

**VI. DAMAGES**

25. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:  
   a. Medical expenses: approximately **$2,500**;  
   b. Lost wages: approximately **$1,200**;  
   c. Pain and suffering;  
   d. Emotional distress and inconvenience; and  
   e. Such other and further damages as may be proven at trial.  

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, **Emily Thompson**, prays that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, **Fresh Market Grocery**, as follows:  

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury, but believed to exceed **$50,000**;  
B. For prejudgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. For costs of this action and reasonable fees as allowable by law; and  
D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**VIII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38(b)**.

Respectfully submitted,  
this **1st day of December, 2025.**
