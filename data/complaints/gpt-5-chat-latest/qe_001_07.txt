#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **March 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the apartment located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA.  
7. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent of **$1,800** in full and on time throughout the tenancy.  
8. Beginning in **winter 2024–2025**, the heating system in the apartment repeatedly malfunctioned, causing indoor temperatures to fall to approximately **60 degrees Fahrenheit** for several hours at a time, most often in the evenings.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant, who sent repair personnel twice. The first repair temporarily improved conditions for approximately one week before the problem recurred.  
10. The second repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and that no further significant repairs were to be made.  
11. Despite continued complaints, Defendant failed to restore adequate and consistent heat to the premises as required by law.  
12. As a result, Plaintiff was compelled to purchase two **space heaters** to maintain habitable temperatures, incurring approximately **$150 per month** in additional electrical costs.  
13. During this period, Plaintiff contracted **bronchitis** in **January 2025**, which her physician indicated was aggravated by the cold conditions in her home. Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred medical expenses for doctor visits and antibiotics.  
14. Defendant has refused to make adequate or lasting repairs to the heating system and has maintained that the system is “working” because it does not fail completely.  
15. Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat and his disregard for the continuing deficiency interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her premises and her right to habitable housing.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)*

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14** provides that a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises is liable for actual and consequential damages, or at least three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
18. Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate and reliable heat constitutes an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 239, §8A** and **G.L. c. 111, §127L**, adequate heat is a condition of habitability and a required housing standard in Massachusetts.  
20. Defendant’s conduct also violated the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. §410.201**, which requires that every dwelling be heated to maintain temperatures of at least 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64°F at all other hours.  
21. Defendant’s failure to maintain heat, despite notice, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, as recognized in multiple decisions of the Massachusetts courts, including:  

   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for interference even if not intentional).  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord responsible when building conditions render tenant’s use substantially impaired).  
   - *Foster v. Hyman*, 346 Mass. 88 (1963) (covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all leases).  
   - *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (statutory quiet enjoyment violation requires substantial interference).  
   - *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (interference by failure to make necessary repairs).  
   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (tenant may recover damages for breach of quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (failure to maintain essential services constitutes breach).  
   - *Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC*, 478 Mass. 697 (2018) (habitability and implied warranties intertwined with quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (compensatory and statutory damages under c. 186, §14).  
   - *Lipsitt v. Plaud*, 466 Mass. 240 (2013) (landlord duty extends to continued maintenance of safe and habitable premises).

22. The persistent loss of heat and resulting health and financial consequences constitute a continuing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
23. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages totaling approximately **$1,450**, including increased utility costs, lost wages, and medical expenses. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional statutory damages under **G.L. c. 186, §14** (three months’ rent, or $5,400, whichever is greater).

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;
