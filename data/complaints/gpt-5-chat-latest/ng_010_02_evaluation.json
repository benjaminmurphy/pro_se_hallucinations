The court expressly states that the tree owner may use his land to grow trees and that the harmed neighbor\u2019s remedy is self\u2011help (cutting roots/branches), not an action for damages or injunction. This directly contradicts, rather than supports, a claimed duty on property owners to maintain trees and vegetation to avoid unreasonable danger to others, and it says nothing about public ways.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe principle involved is that an owner of land is at liberty to use his land, and all of it, to grow trees. Their growth naturally and reasonably will be accompanied by the extension of boughs and the penetration of roots over and into adjoining property of others\u2026 The neighbor, though without right of appeal to the courts if harm results to him, is, nevertheless, not without remedy. His right to cut off the intruding boughs and roots is well recognized\u2026 In this Commonwealth, there was no actionable nuisance and no right of recourse to equity.\u201d"

The finding is that these disbursements were proper and necessary for the comfort of the testatrix and that the daughter gave up a position as school teacher in order to take care of her mother, that the price charged was reasonable, and that she expected to be paid."

Thus, Kent v. Commonwealth is authority for the opposite proposition: that the governmental defendant\u2019s breach was too remote to be the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Citing this case to show that a defendant\u2019s breach was the direct and proximate cause of injuries would misstate its holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe therefore turn to the issue of proximate cause on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of gross negligence. \u2026 Because the duty to prevent harm, and the risk created by MacNeil\u2019s release, were transferred to a law enforcement agency that could lawfully be relied on to perform safely the responsibilities it had assumed, the element of proximate cause, which might otherwise have linked MacNeil\u2019s release on parole with his harmful conduct in Leominster, was extinguished. Subsequent action by the INS releasing MacNeil in Massachusetts became a superseding cause of the harm he inflicted, relieving the Commonwealth of liability as a matter of law.\u201d"
