The court states that \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 signifies freedom from acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leased premises, thereby clearly recognizing that substantial impairment of the character and value of the tenancy constitutes a violation of the tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe common law background of \u00a7 14 also suggests that malicious intent is not a condition of liability. The phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 Winchester v.

The court affirms findings that the tenants were \u201cvery substantially deprived\u201d of quiet enjoyment for a substantial time by noise from a lounge the landlord allowed and controlled, and holds this amounted to a constructive eviction and violation of the implied warranty of quiet enjoyment. This directly aligns with the proposition that substantial impairment of the character and value of the tenancy violates quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThere are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done\u2026 Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable.\u201d"

This reflects the principle that quiet enjoyment is violated when the landlord\u2019s conduct substantially impairs the character and value of the tenancy, even though the specific issue here is whether a lead paint statutory violation alone suffices.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We have also said that \u00a7 14 imposes liability whenever the \u201c \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of a landlord\u2019s action was interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights.\u201d Simon v. Solomon, supra at 102, quoting Westland Hous. Corp. v. Scott, 312 Mass. 375, 381 (1942). In Cruz, we observed that the landlord had notice of the defects in the leased premises which it failed to repair, and that it was \u201cwholly foreseeable\u201d that the injury to the tenant would result from this failure to make the repairs. Indeed, in each case since the 1973 statutory revision in which we have recognized a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, there was evidence that the landlord failed to act reasonably in the circumstances concerning a problem known to the landlord, and the natural and probable consequences of such failure caused the interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises."
