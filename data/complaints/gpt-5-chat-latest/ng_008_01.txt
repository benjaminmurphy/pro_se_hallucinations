**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on Defendant’s premises as a paying customer, having dinner at Defendant’s casual restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.

6. The area between the kitchen and dining room of the restaurant consists of a narrow hallway with a tile floor.  

7. During the course of service, one of Defendant’s servers dropped a tray containing several water glasses, causing water, ice, and broken glass to spill onto the floor.  

8. The server retrieved the broken glass but left the water and ice on the tile floor, stating that she would return shortly to mop up the spill.  

9. The server failed to place any “wet floor” sign, caution cone, or other warning device in the area, despite being aware that the floor was wet and posed a slipping hazard.

10. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff left her dining table to use the restroom and walked through the same hallway.

11. The water and ice remained on the floor; no warning signs had been placed.  

12. Upon stepping on the wet floor, Plaintiff slipped and fell, twisting her right knee.

13. After her fall, Plaintiff overheard restaurant staff remarking that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, evidencing Defendant’s employees’ prior knowledge of the hazardous condition.

14. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain and difficulty bearing weight on her knee.

15. Plaintiff sought medical attention at an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed with a knee sprain. She was fitted with a brace and prescribed physical therapy.

16. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,500 in wages due to missed work.  

17. Plaintiff has endured pain, suffering, and inconvenience, and continues to experience discomfort and limitations in mobility.

18. The harm to Plaintiff was directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and in failing to provide adequate warning of a known hazard.

**IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

19. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

20. Property owners and occupiers in Massachusetts owe lawful visitors the duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining their premises in a safe condition. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).  

21. Defendant, as a business owner, owed Plaintiff, a lawful invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep its premises free from dangerous and unsafe conditions and to warn of such hazards. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

22. Defendant breached that duty by failing to clean the spilled water and ice within a reasonable time, and by failing to place any warning or “wet floor” signage despite actual and constructive notice of the dangerous condition. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

23. Defendant’s employees had actual knowledge of the wet floor and chose to delay corrective action, increasing the risk of injury to customers. *Thurlow v. Crossman*, 336 Mass. 248 (1957).  

24. Defendant’s failure to take timely action constituted a breach of its duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law. *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263 (1961); *Cameron v. Kenney*, 321 Mass. 578 (1947).

25. The dangerous condition was open and obvious to Defendant’s employees, but not to Plaintiff, who had no reason to anticipate that an unmarked hallway would be wet and slippery. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

26. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *Joly v. First Nat’l Stores, Inc.*, 382 Mass. 14 (1980); *Foley v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 336 Mass. 742 (1958).

27. As a further result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, emotional distress, medical expenses, loss of wages, and diminished enjoyment of life. *G.L. c. 231, § 85* governs comparative negligence and imposes liability when the defendant’s negligence is greater than the plaintiff’s, which applies here.

---

**V. DAMAGES**

28. Plaintiff’s economic damages include, but are not limited to, approximately $2,200 in past medical bills and $1,500 in lost wages.

29. Plaintiff also seeks reasonable compensation for her pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by the evidence and the trier of fact.

30. Plaintiff seeks costs allowable under *Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)* and interest pursuant to *G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C*.

---

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Quincy Dining LLC as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount reasonably commensurate with Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and suffering, and expected to be determined at trial;  
B. For reimbursement of Plaintiff’s medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,200 and lost wages of approximately $1,500;  
C. For statutory interest and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C;  
D. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

**VII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to *Mass. R. Civ. P. 38(b).*
