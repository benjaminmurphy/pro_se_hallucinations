### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 30, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful customer at Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Main Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  
6. At approximately 2:00 p.m., while walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff slipped and fell due to a puddle of spilled milk on the floor.  
7. The puddle was visible to employees and large enough to show cart wheel tracks passing through it.  
8. No warning signs, cones, barriers, or other safety measures were in place to alert customers to the danger, in violation of the duties imposed by **Massachusetts common law** on possessors of land.  
9. An employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away from the spill at the time of the incident.  
10. After Plaintiff fell, the employee stated that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but planned to finish his task before retrieving a mop.  
11. Defendant’s employee’s admission demonstrates that Defendant had **actual notice** of the dangerous condition and failed to take reasonable steps to remedy or warn against it.  
12. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a painful hip sprain, required urgent care and several sessions of physical therapy, and missed work at her café job.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses and lost approximately **$800** in wages.  
14. Despite due care, Plaintiff could not have discovered or avoided the hazard, as there were no warnings or barriers present.  
15. Defendant had a duty to maintain the Premises in a safe condition for invitees, to inspect the aisles, to remove hazards promptly, and to warn of any dangerous conditions.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors (**Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010)).  
18. Defendant breached that duty by (a) failing to inspect the dairy aisle within a reasonable period, (b) failing to clean or cordon off the spilled milk, and (c) failing to warn Plaintiff and other shoppers of the known hazard.  
19. A reasonable operator of a grocery store would have discovered and remedied the hazard within a short period after notice, consistent with recognized standards of care (**Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973)).  
20. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.  
21. As a reasonably foreseeable result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, emotional distress, medical expenses, and loss of earnings.

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITY

Defendant’s liability arises under Massachusetts negligence principles set forth in:

- **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343**, adopted by **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (premises liability standard of reasonable care).

- **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) (liability where property owner had notice of hazard and failed to take reasonable steps).  
- **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973) (constructive notice standards).  
- **Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc.**, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002) (foreseeability and duty).  
- **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 416 Mass. 825 (1994) (failure to warn or repair hazardous condition).  
- **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (foreseeability test for proximate cause).  
- **Patterson v. Christ Church in the City of Boston**, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 157 (2014) (reasonable care of premises includes inspection).
