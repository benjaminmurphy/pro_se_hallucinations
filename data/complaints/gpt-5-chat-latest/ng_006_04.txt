### **COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to operate and exit his vehicle with reasonable care and in compliance with Massachusetts traffic laws, including those designed to protect cyclists.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, “[n]o person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so and can be done without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists.”  
19. Defendant breached this statutory duty by carelessly opening his door into the bike lane without checking for approaching cyclists.  
20. The violation of **G.L. c. 90, § 14** constitutes evidence of negligence under well-established Massachusetts law. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355 (1990)**.  
21. Defendant further violated the general duty of reasonable care owed to all other users of the roadway. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)** (motorists owe duty of reasonable care to cyclists); **Coombes v. Florio, 450 Mass. 182 (2007)**.  
22. Defendant’s negligent act directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages. *See* **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006)** (causation requires foreseeability and direct connection).  
23. Massachusetts law recognizes that a driver may be held liable for “dooring” accidents when opening a car door creates a foreseeable risk of harm to bicyclists. *See* **Gonsalves v. Commonwealth, 440 Mass. 603 (2004)**; **O’Malley v. Putnam Safe Deposit Vaults, Inc., 17 Mass. App. Ct. 332 (1983)**.  
24. Defendant’s conduct was unreasonable under the circumstances and constitutes negligence per se. *See* **Bennett**, *supra*; **Kane v. Fields Corner Grille, Inc., 341 Mass. 640 (1961)**.  
25. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to exercise due care when opening his vehicle door. *See* **Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47 (1983)**.  
26. Plaintiff’s comparative fault, if any, was minimal and does not bar recovery under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, because Defendant’s negligence was greater than that of Plaintiff. *See* **Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50 (1988)**.  
27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, lost wages, medical expenses, property damage, and pain and suffering. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540 (1982)** (damages may include physical and emotional harm).
