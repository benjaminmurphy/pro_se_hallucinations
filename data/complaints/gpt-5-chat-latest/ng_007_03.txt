### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son, a participant in Defendant’s after-school program, was present in the gymnasium at Defendant’s facility located at **45 East Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts**.  
6. Defendant advertises and represents to parents and guardians that children in its after-school program will be **supervised at all times** by qualified staff members.  
7. On the date in question, approximately twenty children were under the supposed supervision of two staff members employed by Defendant.  
8. One of those staff members left the gym to attend to paperwork in the office, leaving only one employee in the gymnasium.  
9. The remaining staff member failed to adequately supervise the children and instead remained seated near the bleachers, distracted by her mobile phone.  
10. During this period of inadequate supervision, two older children, approximately twelve years of age, began engaging in rough physical play involving tackling on the hardwood gym floor.  
11. Other children warned the staff member of the dangerous behavior, but the staff member dismissed their concerns, saying “boys will be boys,” and took no corrective or supervisory action.  
12. Shortly thereafter, one of the older children tackled Plaintiff’s son, who struck his head forcefully on the gymnasium floor.  
13. Plaintiff’s son was rendered **unconscious for approximately thirty seconds** and required immediate medical attention.  
14. Plaintiff’s son was transported to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a **concussion and loss of consciousness**.  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately **$5,200 in medical expenses** and **$1,500 in lost wages** due to time taken from work to care for his injured son.  
16. Plaintiff and his family continue to suffer distress and disruption resulting from this incident.

### IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, an entity such as Defendant that undertakes to supervise minor children in its care owes **a duty of reasonable care** to protect those children from foreseeable harm. *See* **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); *Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston*, 365 Mass. 320 (1974).  
19. Defendant, through its employees, had a duty to **adequately supervise** all children in the after-school program, to maintain a safe environment, and to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable injuries. *See* *Poplaski v. Lamphere*, 422 Mass. 83 (1996); *Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc.*, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (2002).  
20. Defendant breached this duty by:  
    a. Failing to maintain the required number of supervising staff in the gymnasium;  
    b. Allowing unmonitored, hazardous play to continue;  
    c. Ignoring direct warnings from other children about the unsafe behavior; and  
    d. Failing to intervene or take preventive measures to safeguard younger children such as Plaintiff’s son.  
21. Defendant’s breach of its duty was negligent and constitutes a failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person or organization would have exercised under similar circumstances. *See* *Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).  
22. Defendant’s negligence was the **direct and proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s son’s injuries, as the risk of physical harm from unsupervised rough play among children was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to supervise. *See* *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101 (1978); *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986).  
23. Plaintiff and his son have suffered actual damages, including medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering, all proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions. *See* *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1987); *Corsetti v. Stone Co.*, 396 Mass. 1 (1985).  
24. No act or omission of the Plaintiff or his son contributed to the cause of this injury under the comparative negligence principles codified in G.L. c. 231, § 85.

### V. DAMAGES

25. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and continues to sustain:  
    a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of **$5,200**;  
    b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of **$1,500**;  
    c. Pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of normal activities for his minor child; and
