v.  

**Michael Johnson,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION
**(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 6)**

---

#### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Lee, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, is the mother of the minor child, **Emma Johnson**, born [Date of Birth intentionally omitted]. Plaintiff’s contact information is (617) 555‑0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. **Defendant:** Michael Johnson, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, is the father of the minor child, Emma Johnson.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and the Court retains continuing jurisdiction to modify its prior judgment regarding custody and parenting time.

---

#### II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

4. On **March 15, 2022**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** providing for shared legal custody of the parties’ minor child, Emma Johnson.

5. The judgment provided that Plaintiff is the **primary residential parent**, and that Defendant has substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnight visits.

6. The order also required both parents to cooperate on all school‑related matters, to ensure Emma’s consistent attendance and academic progress, and to communicate promptly concerning educational decisions.

---

#### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the 2022 judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** adversely affecting the welfare and educational stability of the minor child.

8. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly **kept Emma home from school on Mondays** following his weekend parenting time, referring to these absences as “mental health days.”

9. These absences are not supported by any medical documentation and have caused Emma to receive truancy warnings from her school.

10. The missed school days have contributed to a measurable **decline in Emma’s academic performance**, as reflected in her lower grades and standardized test scores.

11. Defendant has also **refused to transport Emma to scheduled tutoring sessions** occurring during his parenting time, further impeding her educational progress.

12. Defendant’s repeated disregard for the school attendance requirements and tutoring schedule represents a **failure to comply with the spirit and letter of the 2022 judgment**, which emphasized cooperation and consistent school participation.

13. Plaintiff has made multiple good‑faith efforts to discuss and resolve these concerns with Defendant, but Defendant has refused to alter his practices or support Emma’s educational needs.

14. These developments constitute a **substantial change in circumstances** that affects Emma’s best interests and warrant reconsideration of the existing custody order.

---

#### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a prior judgment regarding custody or parenting time upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and where modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  
   - See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

16. The “material change” standard is well established. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981), holds that modification is appropriate when the circumstances existing at the time of the prior judgment have changed significantly so that enforcement of the prior order would no longer be equitable or consistent with the child’s welfare.

17. The Court’s primary consideration must always be the **best interests of the child**, per *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), and *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

18. Continued shared legal custody generally requires a high degree of cooperation between the parents. When such cooperation deteriorates in ways that jeopardize the child’s well‑being, modification may be warranted. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

19. Massachusetts courts have held that repeated non‑compliance with school attendance and parental cooperation requirements can constitute a substantial change in circumstances justifying modification. *Crowe v. Fong*, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 673 (1998).

20. Similarly, *Miller v. Todd*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 1010 (1981), and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981), recognize that breakdowns in communication and parental cooperation regarding education are grounds for revising custody arrangements.

21. In evaluating a proposed modification, the Court should also consider **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, which defines legal custody and directs the court to assess whether continuation of shared decision‑making remains in the child's best interest.

22. Under **G.L. c. 209C, § 10(b)**, the Court may make orders in the child’s best interest concerning custody and visitation in cases involving minor children.

23. Pursuant to these authorities, Plaintiff submits that the evidence demonstrates both a **material change in circumstances** and that **modification serves Emma’s best interests**.

#### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

24. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Modify the Judgment of March 15, 2022, to grant Plaintiff **final decision‑making authority concerning school attendance, tutoring, and educational matters**, or, alternatively,  

   b. Modify Defendant’s parenting time schedule to **eliminate Sunday overnight visits** during the school year to ensure Emma’s consistent school attendance; and  

   c. Include any other appropriate provisions to promote Emma’s educational stability and welfare.

---

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the March 15, 2022 custody order;  
2. Modify the existing judgment to grant Plaintiff **final authority over educational decisions**, or alternatively, to eliminate Defendant’s **Sunday overnight parenting time** during the academic year;  
3. Order both parents to ensure Emma’s consistent school attendance;  
4. Award such **further relief** as the Court deems just, proper, and in the child’s best interests.
