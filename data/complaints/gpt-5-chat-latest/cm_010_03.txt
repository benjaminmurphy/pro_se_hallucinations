**EMMA SMITH, a minor child**  

**JENNIFER SMITH,**  
Plaintiff / Mother,

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

### I. INTRODUCTION

1. The Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith** (“Mother”), brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, and **c. 209C, § 20**, seeking to modify the existing custody and parenting time judgment entered by this Court on **May 15, 2017**, regarding the parties’ minor child, **Emma Smith** (born [DOB intentionally omitted for privacy]).

2. This Court has **continuing jurisdiction** over matters concerning the custody, care, and support of the minor child under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and venue is proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court**.

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. At the time of the prior judgment, the Court awarded primary physical custody (primary residence) of the child to the Defendant, **Michael Smith** (“Father”), and granted the Mother limited parenting time consisting of weekends from Friday after school to Sunday at 5:00 p.m., and one midweek dinner visit.

4. The 2017 order was based largely upon the circumstances then existing: the Mother was enrolled full-time in graduate school, worked irregular hours, resided in a small studio apartment, and was unable to provide full-time residential care.

5. Since entry of that judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the child.

6. Specifically:  
   a. The Mother has completed her graduate studies and obtained stable, full-time employment with regular daytime hours.  
   b. The Mother now resides in a safe, two-bedroom apartment in which the child, Emma, has her own bedroom.  
   c. The Mother’s improved financial stability and housing situation enable her to provide consistent daily care and a nurturing home environment.  
   d. The child has expressed a strong and consistent desire to spend more time with her Mother, including more overnights.  
   e. Emma’s therapist has reported that the child experiences distress and guilt when she must leave her Mother after short visits, and that a modified schedule allowing more meaningful contact would support Emma’s emotional well-being.  
   f. The Father has refused to engage in discussion or mediation about adjusting the parenting schedule and becomes angry when the subject is raised, placing the child in an emotionally uncomfortable position.  

7. These changes collectively constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the 2017 judgment, warranting modification in the child’s best interest under **Massachusetts domestic relations law**.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITIES

8. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may revise or alter a custody or parenting plan judgment upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is **in the best interests of the child**.

9. See **Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015)** (court must find both a material change and that modification serves the child’s best interests).  

10. The standard for modification is well established: a change in circumstances that affects the child’s welfare and makes the existing order inconsistent with her current best interests. **Kirby v. Kirby, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 678 (2017)**; **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**.

11. The “best interests of the child” are the paramount concern of the Court in all custody determinations. **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**; **Care & Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704 (1984)**.

12. The Court evaluates not only the parents’ respective circumstances but also the developmental and emotional needs of the child. **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**; **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**.

13. A parent’s post-judgment improvements in stability, housing, and ability to provide consistent care can constitute a material change supporting modification. **Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286 (2009)**; **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.

14. The Court also gives weight to a child’s expressed preferences, especially as the child matures. **Custody of a Minor (No. 1), 377 Mass. 876 (1979)**; **Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)**.

15. The child’s therapeutic evidence and the child’s expressed desire for more time with a parent are legitimate factors supporting modification. **Miller v. Miller, 448 Mass. 320 (2007)**; **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)**.

16. The accumulation of these authorities supports that a balanced modification, providing Emma with additional parenting time with her Mother, is in the child’s best interests and consistent with Massachusetts law.

### IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

17. The Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the 2017 judgment and that a modification of custody and parenting time is warranted.

18. The Mother requests that the Court enter an order granting her **expanded physical custody** or, alternatively, a **shared physical custody** arrangement, to include at minimum:  
   - Overnights on alternating weeks (e.g., Thursday after school through Monday school drop-off);  
   - One midweek overnight during the off-week; and  
   - Equitably divided school vacations, holidays, and summer schedules.

19. The Mother further requests that the Court order the parties to participate in **co-parenting counseling** or mediation as may be beneficial to implement the modified plan and reduce conflict.

20. Such modification is in the best interest of Emma Smith, ensuring her continued healthy emotional and psychological development, maintaining her close bond with both parents, and reflecting current realities rather than outdated circumstances from 2017.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Determine that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the prior judgment entered on May 15, 2017;  
B. Modify the Judgment of Custody and/or Parenting Time to provide for a parenting plan consistent with the child’s current developmental, emotional, and physical needs;  
C. Grant the Mother expanded or shared physical custody as set forth above, or such schedule as the Court deems appropriate;  
D. Order the parties to engage in co-parenting communication counseling or mediation to minimize conflict; and  
E. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
