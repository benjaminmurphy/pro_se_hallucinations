### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at **123 Main Street, Chelsea, MA 02150**, for a monthly rent of **$1,500**.  
6. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid her rent in full and complied with all material terms of the tenancy.  
7. The building’s main entryway door has had a **broken lock**, which fails to latch properly, allowing entry by unauthorized persons.  
8. Plaintiff **first notified Defendant** of this condition approximately **two months prior to December 1, 2025**, and Defendant promised, but failed, to repair the lock.  
9. Plaintiff sent **two follow-up reminders**, but Defendant still did not remedy the defect.  
10. In **November 2025**, trespassers entered the building through the unlocked door and **tampered with tenants’ mail**, resulting in theft of packages, including one belonging to Plaintiff valued at approximately **$120**.  
11. Since that incident, Plaintiff has observed evidence that someone may be **sleeping in the basement**, heightening her sense of vulnerability and fear.  
12. As a result of these failures to secure the property, Plaintiff has had to purchase a **security camera and a new deadbolt** for her own apartment door, costing approximately **$200**.  
13. Despite repeated requests, Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable measures to repair the lock or ensure the building’s security.  
14. Defendant’s neglect has **substantially impaired Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment** of the leased premises by depriving her of reasonable security and peace in her home.  
15. Plaintiff has suffered **economic losses** of at least **$320** and **emotional distress and anxiety** due to unsafe conditions in her residence.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, every tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with the tenant’s right to the beneficial and peaceful enjoyment of the premises.  
18. Defendant’s repeated failure to repair the building’s main entry door, despite notice, constitutes **interference “by omission”** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from both **affirmative acts** and **willful neglect** that disturbs their use and comfort (*Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)).  
20. Defendant’s actions and inactions have directly interfered with Plaintiff’s enjoyment and use of her leasehold and have caused $320 in direct losses, along with mental anguish and disruption of her home life.  
21. Such conduct violates **G.L. c. 186, §14**, which entitles a tenant to **actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, in cases of interference with quiet enjoyment.  
22. Defendant’s neglect constitutes a **breach of statutory and common-law duty** to maintain habitable and secure premises (*Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 326 Mass. 393 (1950); *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)).  
23. Massachusetts law imposes liability for substantial disturbances or unsafe conditions that are **foreseeable results of a landlord’s inaction** (*Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Dolan v. Suffolk Franklin Sav. Bank*, 355 Mass. 665 (1969)).  
24. Defendant’s disregard of Plaintiff’s repeated complaints demonstrates **willful or knowing neglect**, qualifying as a violation under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, entitling Plaintiff to statutory damages.  
25. The lack of secure entry and resulting trespasses and theft constitute **a substantial interference** under Massachusetts precedent (*Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Winthrop Realty Trust v. Shrewsbury*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 474 (2007)).  
26. By failing to act, Defendant constructively denied Plaintiff **peaceful possession**, causing her humiliation, fear, and expenses directly traceable to Defendant’s omissions (*McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300 (1999)).
