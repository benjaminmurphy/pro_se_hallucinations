### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

### I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor (“Plaintiff”), against her landlord, Mark Stevens (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14.

2. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 21, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $7,000, and venue is proper because the leased premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

3. The events giving rise to this action occurred at Plaintiff’s residence, located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. PARTIES

4. Plaintiff Jessica Taylor is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301.  

5. Defendant Mark Stevens is an individual and landlord doing business in Massachusetts and maintaining ownership and control of the Premises at the same address.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the Premises for a monthly rent of $1,200.

7. Plaintiff has at all times paid her rent timely and complied with all obligations under the tenancy.

8. On or about November 10, 2025, the Premises’ hot water service ceased to function. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the problem.

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part and stated that he had ordered it. However, Defendant failed to restore hot water service thereafter.

10. Between approximately November 10, 2025, and December 1, 2025, the Premises remained without hot water, constituting a violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. § 410.190, which requires that every dwelling unit have an adequate supply of hot water at all times.

11. Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant of the ongoing lack of hot water, but the problem persisted for three weeks.

12. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered significant discomfort, inconvenience, and expense, including being forced to shower at a local gym (costing approximately $30 per month plus travel expenses) and bringing her infant child to a relative’s home for baths.

13. Defendant has not restored full use of hot water to the Premises as of the date of this filing.

14. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises have been substantially interfered with by Defendant’s failure to maintain essential services required for habitable living conditions.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, a landlord is prohibited from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from substantial interference with their tenancy, even when the landlord’s acts or omissions are negligent rather than intentional. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

18. The absence of essential services such as hot water constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Dartmouth Consumer Group v. Town of Dartmouth*, 384 Mass. 255 (1981).

19. Defendant’s failure to maintain hot water violated the State Sanitary Code and thereby constituted a breach per se of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

20. Defendant’s continued failure to remedy the lack of hot water over a three-week period is an “act or omission of the landlord” that interfered with Plaintiff’s “quiet enjoyment” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

21. The protections afforded by G.L. c. 186, § 14 apply regardless of Defendant’s intent where the interference is substantial and renders the premises less fit to live in. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

22. Defendant’s conduct is also inconsistent with the implied warranty of habitability recognized in *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, and further supports a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment. *Khan v. Elkman*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 968 (2006).

23. Persistent failure to provide hot water has been recognized as a violation of both the State Sanitary Code and G.L. c. 186, § 14. *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including financial losses, inconvenience, and loss of use and comfort.

### V. DAMAGES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

25. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (though Plaintiff is self-represented).

26. Plaintiff seeks actual damages in the amount of $400, representing the inconvenience, additional expenses, and diminished value of the tenancy.

27. Plaintiff also seeks such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award Plaintiff actual damages of $400 or statutory damages equal to three months’ rent ($3,600), whichever is greater, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
C. Award costs, interest, and such further relief as justice and equity may require.

---

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
