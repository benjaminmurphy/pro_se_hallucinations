### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. At all relevant times, Defendant was the owner and person in control of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

6. A large, mature maple tree stood on Defendant’s property adjacent to the public sidewalk.

7. Prior to August 15, 2023, one of the tree’s major branches extending over the sidewalk had become visibly cracked, drooping, and unstable.

8. Plaintiff and other neighborhood residents observed this cracked branch for several months and expressed concern to Defendant, suggesting that he contact an arborist for inspection and removal.

9. Defendant responded that he would “deal with it in the spring” but made no effort to inspect, trim, or otherwise address the dangerous condition.

10. On August 15, 2023, during an ordinary summer thunderstorm with average wind and rain conditions, the cracked branch broke off the tree and fell directly onto the public sidewalk where Plaintiff was lawfully walking.

11. The branch struck Plaintiff’s right shoulder and upper back, knocking her to the ground.

12. As a result, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain, contusions, and other bodily injuries, requiring medical examination and treatment.

13. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $500 in wages due to her injuries.

14. The dangerous condition of the tree limb was open and obvious to Defendant for a substantial period of time prior to the incident, giving him ample opportunity to take preventive measures.

15. Defendant owed a duty to maintain his property and vegetation in a reasonably safe condition such that foreseeable hazards would not cause injury to persons using the adjacent public way.

16. Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to inspect, repair, or remove the hazardous limb despite knowing, or having reason to know, that it posed an unreasonable risk to passersby.

17. Defendant’s breach of this duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.

### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.

19. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner owes a duty of reasonable care to all persons lawfully on or adjacent to their property. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).

20. Defendant, as the landowner, had a duty to maintain his property and appurtenances— including vegetation extending over public sidewalks—so as not to create a foreseeable hazard to travelers. *Robbins v. Athol Gas & Elec. Co.*, 236 Mass. 387 (1920); *Roman v. Boston*, 127 Mass. 308 (1879).

21. The standard of care requires landowners to take reasonable steps to inspect and correct dangerous conditions. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).

22. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the cracked branch was likely to fall and injure someone using the public sidewalk. *Carkin v. Reynolds*, 306 Mass. 225 (1940) (landowner liable where decayed tree limb overhanging highway fell on traveler).

23. Failing to take timely remedial action constituted an unreasonable and negligent omission within the meaning of *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).

24. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, physical pain, mental suffering, and economic losses. *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312 (2002); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006).

25. Plaintiff sustained damages including but not limited to:  
   a. medical expenses of approximately $2,500;  
   b. lost wages of approximately $500;  
   c. pain and suffering; and  
   d. diminished quality of life.

26. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 85, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages and statutory interest.
