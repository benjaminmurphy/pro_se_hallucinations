The reasoning focuses on the landlords\u2019 failure to effectively abate disruptive noise they had the power to control, treating that inaction as a breach sufficient to support constructive eviction and non-liability for rent. This squarely supports using Blackett as authority that a landlord\u2019s failure to act, when they have control over the source of disturbance, can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done. \u2026 Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable."

The court explicitly finds no constructive eviction and resolves the case instead under the newly adopted rule of mutually dependent covenants and a breach of an express covenant to maintain the roof. It therefore does not provide authority that the landlord\u2019s omissions here violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment, even though it recognizes that omissions can be relevant to constructive eviction analysis.",
