## **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This action is brought in the **Cambridge Division of the District Court Department of the Trial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts** pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court because the leased premises and events giving rise to this action occurred in **Cambridge, Massachusetts**, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.  
5. Jurisdiction is proper under **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this action concerns a landlord-tenant dispute and damages arising from the rental of residential property.

---

## **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. Plaintiff began renting the apartment at **123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139** from Defendant on or about **May 1, 2022**, pursuant to a written or oral lease agreement at a monthly rent of **$2,400**.  
7. The lease includes, whether expressly or impliedly, a **covenant of quiet enjoyment** as mandated by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, ensuring the tenant’s right to peaceful and undisturbed use and enjoyment of the premises.  
8. Beginning approximately **October 1, 2025**, and continuing through the present, Defendant undertook renovations in the **adjacent apartment unit**.  
9. The construction has caused persistent and excessive **noise, vibration, and dust**, including **drilling, hammering, and loud conversation** from workers, occurring from approximately **8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays**.  
10. Dust and other particulate matter have **entered Plaintiff’s unit through ventilation ducts**, accumulating on surfaces and affecting indoor air quality.  
11. The noise and dust have significantly **disrupted Plaintiff’s ability to work from home**, participate in phone calls, and otherwise enjoy the premises.  
12. Defendant offered Plaintiff a **$100 rent reduction** for one month, which does not reasonably compensate for the disruption, discomfort, and loss of use experienced.  
13. Despite notice of these ongoing issues, Defendant has failed to take adequate measures to protect Plaintiff’s right to **quiet enjoyment**—such as temporary relocation assistance, meaningful rent abatement, or noise mitigation efforts.  
14. The renovation work is expected to continue for **one to two additional months**, prolonging the interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.  
15. Defendant’s conduct has resulted in Plaintiff suffering **loss of use, mental distress, and inconvenience**, warranting damages of approximately **$2,000**.

## **CAUSE OF ACTION**

### **Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
*(G.L. c. 186, § 14)*

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–15 above as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord is prohibited from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is **implied in every tenancy** under Massachusetts law. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
19. In *Blackett*, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord or the landlord’s agents or activities under the landlord’s control substantially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises, even if the landlord’s conduct is not malicious.  
20. The ongoing renovation under Defendant’s control constitutes a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment, similar to the noise-based violation recognized in *Blackett v. Olanoff*.  
21. Massachusetts law provides that a landlord’s failure to protect a tenant from foreseeable disruptions amounts to a **constructive breach of quiet enjoyment**. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
22. The interference here is **substantial and unreasonable**, rendering the premises less suitable for its intended purpose—peaceful residential occupancy. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
23. Defendant’s actions (and failure to act) are attributable to him as the property owner and principal who authorized or acquiesced in the disruptive renovation work. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
24. Defendant’s conduct violated the **statutory covenant set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14**, as well as the common-law duty recognized by Massachusetts courts. See *Winthrop Garage Co. v. Weinstein*, 329 Mass. 270 (1952).  
25. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for **actual and consequential damages**, including mental distress, or **a statutory minimum of three months’ rent**, whichever is greater.  
26. Plaintiff is entitled to damages for loss of enjoyment, mental distress, and interference with her quiet possession. See *McAllister v. Boston Housing Authority*, 429 Mass. 300 (1999); *Shapiro v. Grinspoon*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 596 (1989).  
27. Plaintiff’s right to peaceful use was further recognized in *Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.*, 439 Mass. 512 (2003), emphasizing that landlord-controlled disturbances may breach the statutory covenant even without ill intent.  
28. Defendant failed to maintain the leased premises in a manner consistent with **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, which permits tenants to raise breach of quiet enjoyment as a defense or affirmative claim in a landlord-tenant dispute.  
29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages estimated at **$2,000**, representing a reasonable measure of her losses.
