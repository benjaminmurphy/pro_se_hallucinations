### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith**, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws and the inherent equitable authority of the Probate and Family Court. In support thereof, the Plaintiff avers as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. The Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of minor children **Emily Smith (age 10)** and **Jacob Smith (age 7)**.  
2. The Defendant, **David Smith**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of said children.  
3. The original **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan** was issued by this Honorable Court on **April 15, 2022**.  
4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters of custody and visitation under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**.  
5. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** as both parties reside within this jurisdiction and the prior judgment was entered here.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. The current Judgment provides for **joint legal custody**, with **primary physical custody to the Plaintiff** and parenting time for the Defendant on a regular schedule.  
7. The Judgment requires both parents to **foster the children’s relationship with the other parent** and to **refrain from disparagement** of the other parent in the presence of the children.  
8. Since the entry of the 2022 Judgment, significant and material changes in circumstances have occurred affecting the welfare of the children.  
9. Over the past year, the Defendant has **unilaterally enrolled the children in extracurricular activities** that directly conflict with the Plaintiff’s parenting time, without conferring or obtaining her consent, contrary to the spirit of joint legal custody.  
10. When scheduling conflicts arise, the Defendant tells the children that the Plaintiff is “selfish” or “doesn’t really love them” for declining to switch weekends, directly undermining the children’s emotional security and violating the requirement not to disparage the other parent.  
11. The Plaintiff has observed behavioral changes and physical symptoms in the children, including **stomach aches and anxiety**, particularly on transition days, indicating stress and emotional strain linked to parental conflict.  
12. The Defendant’s actions demonstrate a pattern of **inconsistent co-parenting, manipulation of the children, and refusal to collaborate** on significant parenting decisions.  
13. These changes constitute a **material and substantial alteration in the circumstances** existing at the time of the 2022 Judgment and adversely affect the best interests of the minor children.  
14. The Plaintiff has attempted to communicate with the Defendant and resolve these matters cooperatively, but her efforts have been unsuccessful.  
15. A modification of the custody order is therefore necessary to promote the welfare and stability of the minor children.

---

### III. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

16. Custody and parenting modifications are governed by **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which authorizes the Court to modify prior judgments upon a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of minor children.  
17. The standard for modification requires a showing of a “material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the previous judgment” and that modification would serve the best interests of the children. *See* **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Herbert v. Herbert**, 303 Mass. 369 (1939).  
18. Joint legal custody is contingent upon the parents’ ability to communicate and make shared decisions. Where cooperation and mutual respect have broken down, modification to sole legal custody may be warranted. *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  
19. The “best interests of the child” standard remains the paramount consideration. *See* **Care & Protection of Three Minors**, 392 Mass. 704 (1984); **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  
20. Persistent disparagement or conduct undermining a child’s relationship with the other parent supports modification of custody. *See* **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
21. Section 31 of **M.G.L. c. 208** explicitly places emphasis on the child’s safety and well-being when assessing parental cooperation in joint custody.  
22. When one parent acts unilaterally in major parenting decisions—such as scheduling and activities—this constitutes a material breakdown of cooperative parenting. *See* **Rosenberg v. Merida**, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).  
23. Massachusetts courts have recognized that failure to honor visitation and co-parenting obligations, coupled with emotional manipulation of the children, can justify transferring primary or legal custody. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 1007 (2010).  
24. In exercising its discretion, the Court retains inherent authority to modify its judgments when justice and the child’s welfare require. *See* **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**; **Ardizoni v. Raymond**, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

### IV. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the Judgment of April 15, 2022;  
B. Modify the existing custody order to award the Plaintiff **sole legal custody** of the minor children, or in the alternative, establish clearer provisions regarding joint decision-making and scheduling of activities;  
C. Clarify that all extracurricular scheduling and educational decisions must be made jointly, in writing, at least two weeks in advance, and that neither parent shall disparage the other parent to or in front of the children;  
D. Modify the parenting schedule to reflect that the children shall **reside primarily with the Plaintiff**, with parenting time for the Defendant as the Court deems appropriate in accordance with the best interests of the children;  
E. Grant such further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
