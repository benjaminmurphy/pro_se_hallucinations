### COMPLAINT  
(NEGLIGENCE)

Plaintiff Jacob Adams (“Plaintiff”), by way of Complaint against Defendant Linda Greene (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jacob Adams is an individual residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Linda Greene is, upon information and belief, the owner and landlord of a three‑unit residential building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Property”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000 and because the events giving rise to this cause of action occurred within the jurisdictional district of this Court.  
4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the Defendant resides and/or does business in Worcester County and the tortious conduct giving rise to the injury occurred there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about February 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully upon the premises located at 123 Maple Street in Worcester, Massachusetts, delivering groceries to one of the tenants who resided there.  
6. Defendant, as the owner and landlord of the Property, owed a duty under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, § 15, and under common law, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the Property, including the adjacent sidewalk, in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors.  
7. Following a snowstorm in February 2023, Defendant undertook to shovel the sidewalk in front of the Property but failed to apply any salt, sand, or other de‑icing materials.  
8. The shoveled path created by Defendant was narrow and, due to melting and refreezing over subsequent days, became a sheet of ice that rendered the sidewalk dangerous and hazardous for pedestrians.  
9. Prior to February 15, 2023, tenants of the Property notified Defendant by text message and photographs that the sidewalk had become dangerously icy. Defendant responded by stating “the sun will take care of it” and took no further remedial action.  
10. On February 15, 2023, while walking on the sidewalk to deliver groceries, Plaintiff slipped on the icy surface created by Defendant’s neglect and fell backwards onto the pavement, suffering immediate pain and injury to his lower back.  
11. Plaintiff was transported for medical evaluation and treatment, incurring medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500.  
12. As a direct result of his injury, Plaintiff missed approximately one week of work, losing wages of about $800.  
13. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and discomfort in his lower back as a result of the fall.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as though fully set forth herein.  
15. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to keep the sidewalk and approaches to the Property in a safe condition for lawful visitors. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
16. Defendant’s duty included, but was not limited to, the duty to remove snow and ice hazards or otherwise make the area reasonably safe. *See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 435 Mass. 353 (2001).  
17. Defendant breached this duty by (a) failing to properly remove or treat ice on the sidewalk; (b) failing to heed tenant warnings about the condition; and (c) affirmatively relying on natural melting to remedy a known danger.  
18. Defendant’s acts and omissions were unreasonable and constituted negligence under Massachusetts law, including the principles articulated in *Papadopoulos*, *Mounsey*, and **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).  
19. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.  
20. Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer physical injury, emotional distress, medical expenses, lost wages, and impairment in daily activities due to Defendant’s negligence.

---

### V. DAMAGES

21. As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500;  
   b. Lost wages totaling approximately $800;  
   c. Pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   d. Such other damages as will be proven at trial.  
22. Plaintiff’s damages are within the jurisdictional limits of this Court and are believed to exceed $3,300 exclusive of costs and interest.

---

### VI. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

Plaintiff’s claim arises under Massachusetts common and statutory negligence law, including the following authorities which establish Defendant’s duty, breach, and Plaintiff’s right to recover damages:

1. **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) – Abolishing the distinction between natural and unnatural accumulations of snow and ice; landowners must act reasonably in all circumstances.  
2. **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) – Establishing a duty of reasonable care owed to all lawful entrants.  
3. **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) – Addressing foreseeability and duty in premises‑liability negligence actions.  
4. **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 435 Mass. 353 (2001) – Recognizing duty of care in maintaining premises.  
5. **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) – Discussing duty, breach, and proximate cause in negligence cases.  
6. **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37 (2009) – Setting forth the four elements of negligence under Massachusetts law.  
7. **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000) – Duty to protect against open and obvious dangers is fact‑dependent.  
8. **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.**, 376 Mass. 101 (1978) – Landowner liability for failure to warn or remedy hazardous conditions.  
9. **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 231, § 85** – Comparative negligence standard in tort actions.  
10. **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 15** – Landlord’s duty to maintain common areas in safe condition.  

These authorities collectively establish that Defendant owed Plaintiff a nondelegable duty of reasonable care regarding snow and ice removal and that her failure to act reasonably renders her liable for Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
