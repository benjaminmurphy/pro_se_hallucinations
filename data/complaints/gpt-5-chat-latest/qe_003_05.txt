### COMPLAINT  
*(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)*  

---

### INTRODUCTION

This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff **Alexandra Rivera** against her landlord, Defendant **Michael Thompson**, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, § 14. Defendant’s failure to repair a persistent roof leak and resulting mold and water damage in Plaintiff’s apartment at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts has interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and caused financial and personal harm.

---

### PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff**, *Alexandra Rivera*, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 2, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  
2. **Defendant**, *Michael Thompson*, on information and belief, is an individual who owns and manages the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

---

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Boston Housing Court Department** pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3 and § 20, because the defendant is a landlord and the property is located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court.  
4. This action arises from Defendant’s violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **December 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease with Defendant to rent a studio apartment at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, for a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. During the showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling and inquired about them. Defendant represented that they were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”  
7. Shortly after moving in, during the first significant rainstorm, the roof again leaked in the exact same location, dripping water into Plaintiff’s living space.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant multiple times of the ongoing water infiltration and requested repairs.  
9. Despite repeated notice, Defendant failed to properly repair the leak. Instead, he told Plaintiff that the water intrusion was a “minor cosmetic issue” and part of the building’s “character.”  
10. Over time, the leak worsened. During one storm, water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and damaged a laptop on her coffee table, requiring replacement at a cost of approximately **$900**.  
11. Persistent dampness produced a musty odor and mold growth near the ceiling and wall area.  
12. Plaintiff began experiencing headaches and other symptoms that she reasonably believes were caused by mold exposure.  
13. Plaintiff was forced to rearrange her living space, moving her bed away from the affected area, leaving only part of the apartment practically usable.  
14. Defendant’s failure to make necessary repairs rendered the apartment partially uninhabitable and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
15. As a result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use of the affected area, property damage, and personal discomfort and distress.

### COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
*(G.L. c. 186, § 14)*

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises either directly or through neglect of obligations under law.  
18. Massachusetts law implies in every residential lease a covenant of quiet enjoyment, ensuring that the tenant’s possession shall not be materially disturbed. *See* **Lezberg v. Rogers**, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 115, 117 (1989).  
19. The covenant is violated when conditions substantially impair the character and value of the leased premises or render them unfit for human habitation. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  
20. Defendant’s ongoing failure to correct chronic water leaks and consequent mold growth constitutes a substantial interference, amounting to a breach of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
21. A landlord’s inaction in the face of recurring leaks and moisture infiltration is actionable under G.L. c. 186, § 14. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 716 (1977); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
22. Persistent leaks and unremedied defects that cause water penetration or mold are recognized forms of interference. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).  
23. Defendant had actual notice of the problem through repeated complaints and failed to take reasonable steps to abate the condition, as required by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, and the implied warranty of habitability recognized in *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  
24. The presence of chronic leaks and resulting mold constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, **105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.**, which defines such conditions as rendering a dwelling unfit for human habitation; violation of the code supports a finding of interference with quiet enjoyment. *See* **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
25. Defendant’s conduct was willful, or at least knowing and negligent, in disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.  
26. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, property loss, and the deprivation of use and enjoyment of her home, all within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

### DAMAGES

27. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
28. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is **$1,200**; thus, statutory damages equal to three months’ rent would be **$3,600**, in addition to reimbursement for her **$900** property loss and any other consequential damages the Court deems appropriate.  
29. Plaintiff also seeks reasonable attorneys’ fees (if she later retains counsel) and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of **$3,600** or three times her monthly rent, whichever is greater, plus **$900** for property loss, with interest and costs;
