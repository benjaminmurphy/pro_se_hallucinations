Ellard is the landmark Massachusetts case abolishing the invitee/licensee distinction and imposing a general duty of reasonable care owed by possessors of land to all lawful entrants. Although the excerpt provided is only a concurrence focused on the treatment of trespassers, the majority opinion clearly holds that an occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors, which necessarily encompasses lawful business invitees. Thus, the case does support the proposition, even if the quoted passage does not itself state it.",

The duty owed by an occupier of land is the same to all lawful visitors: to act as a reasonable man in maintaining his property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk."

While the opinion recites the general duty of a possessor of business premises to use due care to keep the premises reasonably safe, it does not articulate a specific affirmative duty to inspect aisles, displays, or shelving as framed in the proposition.
