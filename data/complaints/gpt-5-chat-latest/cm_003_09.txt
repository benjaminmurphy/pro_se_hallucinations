# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
**Filed Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20**

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff, **Jessica Marshall** (“Plaintiff”), respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and related provisions of Massachusetts family law to modify the existing custody judgment entered by this Court on **September 15, 2021**, awarding the parties shared legal custody of their minor child, **Ethan Reed** (age 8).  

Since the entry of the prior judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** adversely affecting the welfare of the minor child, warranting modification of the custody and parenting provisions of the current order.

## II. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Marshall, of [Plaintiff’s address], Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Thomas Reed, of [Defendant’s address], Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

3. **Minor Child:** Ethan Reed, born [date of birth], currently age 8.

---

## III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. The Middlesex Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10–20**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**.  
5. Venue properly lies in this Court because both parties and the minor child reside within Middlesex County, and the prior custody judgment was issued by this Court.

---

## IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6. On **September 15, 2021**, following the parties’ separation, this Court entered an order awarding **shared legal custody** of Ethan Reed, with **primary physical custody to Plaintiff**, and **scheduled weekend parenting time** with Defendant.  
7. At the time of that order, both parents were found to be stable, capable of co-parenting appropriately, and fit to share custody in the best interests of the minor child.  
8. Over the past several months, conditions have changed substantially in the home of the Defendant.  
9. Ethan has told Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that sometimes Defendant “can’t walk straight,” suggesting excessive consumption of alcohol or intoxicating substances.  
10. A neighbor who is familiar with the family’s situation recently sent Plaintiff a **video** showing Defendant stumbling while attempting to help Ethan out of a car late at night.  
11. Ethan has appeared **exhausted and disoriented** upon returning to school on Monday mornings following visitation weekends. Teachers and school staff have noted this consistent pattern to Plaintiff.  
12. Plaintiff has made genuine, good‑faith efforts to communicate with Defendant about these concerns, but Defendant has been **defensive and uncooperative**, refusing to address them.  
13. Defendant’s apparent impairment, coupled with Ethan’s reports and school concerns, demonstrates a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting Ethan’s welfare and safety.  
14. Plaintiff believes that continuation of the current custody arrangement **poses a risk** to Ethan’s emotional and physical well‑being.

## V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of **changed circumstances** and where the proposed modification would serve the **best interests of the child**.  
16. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that when the original basis for a custody arrangement has significantly changed, a modification is warranted. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).  
17. The “material and substantial change” standard ensures that modification serves the child’s welfare and stability. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
18. When a parent’s conduct potentially endangers the child, it constitutes a sufficient change in circumstances. See **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
19. Courts prioritize the **best interests of the child** in all custody determinations. See **Felton v. Felton**, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).  
20. Massachusetts law authorizes modification to impose supervision or restrictions when warranted by evidence of harm or instability. See **Zatsky v. Zatsky**, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 7 (1994).  
21. The Court has a continuing duty under **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), to ensure the child’s best interests are protected as circumstances evolve.  
22. The evidence described herein reflects a pattern consistent with diminished parental fitness or supervision by Defendant, a factor directly relevant under **Adoption of Paula**, 420 Mass. 716 (1995).  
23. Continued unsupervised overnight visitation is inconsistent with the child’s safety and welfare as articulated in **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
24. The combination of Defendant’s apparent substance misuse, the child’s exhaustion and anxiety, and third‑party corroboration constitutes clear and specific evidence supporting modification of the previous judgment.

## VI. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Marshall** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the custody judgment on **September 15, 2021**;  
B. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting‑time order by granting **primary legal and physical custody** of Ethan Reed to Plaintiff;  
C. **Order** that Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised** or subject to conditions deemed necessary to protect Ethan’s welfare, including refraining from alcohol consumption or impairment during parenting time;  
D. **Require** that Defendant participate in appropriate evaluations, such as substance‑use or parenting assessments, as the Court deems fit;  
E. **Order** such further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to ensure the child’s safety and best interests.

---

## VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff prays that after hearing, the Court will:

1. Enter judgment modifying custody consistent with the child’s best interests;  
2. Establish safe, structured parenting conditions;  
3. Award any other relief necessary to serve justice and ensure Ethan’s safety and stability.
