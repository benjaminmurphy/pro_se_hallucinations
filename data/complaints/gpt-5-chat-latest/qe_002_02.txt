**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Jordan Lee** (“Plaintiff”), is a resident of Roxbury, Massachusetts, residing at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.  
2. The Defendant, **Martha Johnson** (“Defendant”), is the owner and landlord of the premises at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, and resides or maintains a business office in Boston, Massachusetts.  
3. At all times relevant, Defendant acted as landlord to the Plaintiff pursuant to a residential tenancy agreement beginning March 1, 2022, under which Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, as this matter concerns a residential tenancy and claim arising under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  
5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, as the property in question is located within this Division’s jurisdiction.  
6. The amount in controversy, including damages, attorney's fees, and statutory penalties under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, does not exceed the court’s jurisdictional limit.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. In or around October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late with rent due to medical bills but paid the full amount, including late fees.  
8. Beginning in November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water seeping through the basement wall of the leased premises during rainfall.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant via text message that water was entering the apartment. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but failed to make any repairs or take further action.  
10. Several weeks passed with no remediation by Defendant, and the water intrusion continued.  
11. Because Defendant failed to address the problem, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston’s Inspectional Services Department.  
12. The city inspector confirmed the existence of water infiltration and cited the property for violations of the Massachusetts Sanitary Code, **105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.**, including failure to maintain the foundation in a watertight condition.  
13. The water intrusion caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, totaling approximately $400 in damages.  
14. Plaintiff also incurred additional electric costs in operating a dehumidifier continuously to mitigate dampness in the unit.  
15. Defendant became aware of Plaintiff’s report to city inspectors and subsequently referred to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”  
16. Defendant informed Plaintiff that she would not renew the lease, purportedly due to late payment of rent in October, even though Plaintiff had since paid in full and incurred no further late payments.  
17. The stated reason for nonrenewal is pretextual, and Defendant’s conduct was retaliatory and intended to interfere with Plaintiff’s lawful quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
18. Defendant’s failure to repair and her subsequent retaliatory treatment directly and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

19. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 above.  
20. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of rented premises is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
21. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable and watertight condition constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
22. As in **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), prolonged failure to remedy recurring leaks and water damage constitutes a disturbance of a tenant’s quiet enjoyment.  
23. Defendant’s conduct also constitutes unlawful interference where her retaliatory statements and intent not to renew were prompted by Plaintiff’s lawful complaint to authorities, violating **G.L. c. 186, § 18**, and demonstrating willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights.  
24. Pursuant to **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997)**,** a tenant need not abandon the premises to claim violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
25. Defendant’s neglect of the water infiltration violated her statutory duties under **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, **G.L. c. 111, § 127A**, and the state sanitary code provisions at **105 C.M.R. 410.500** (requiring maintenance of foundation and structural elements in a watertight condition).  
26. Defendant’s conduct meets the standard of interference with quiet enjoyment recognized in **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994)**,** where a landlord’s omissions that materially impair a tenant’s use of premises are actionable.  
27. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that water leaks, dampness, and failure to repair code violations constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Gabler v. Naiman**, 402 Mass. 224 (1988); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
28. Defendant’s retaliatory threats and interference, following Plaintiff’s lawful complaint to city inspectors, further violate the tenant protections embodied in **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, and **Spence v. O’Brien**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983).  
29. As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff suffered property damage, incurred additional electrical costs, and endured substantial emotional distress due to the persistent uninhabitable conditions.

### V. DAMAGES

30. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages approximating $400 in damaged property, along with additional utility expenses and the loss of the full beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises.  
31. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (though Plaintiff is self-represented).  
32. Plaintiff also seeks statutory interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B** from the date of injury.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on the claim of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount equal to three months’ rent ($3,600) or actual damages, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff reimbursement for property loss, excess utility costs, and any other consequential damages;  
D. Award statutory interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
