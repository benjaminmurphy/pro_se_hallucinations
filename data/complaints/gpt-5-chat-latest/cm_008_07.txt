**LAURA THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL REED**,  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson**, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and applicable Massachusetts case law, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody judgment entered March 15, 2021, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, **Emily Reed (DOB: [not listed for privacy])**, such that modification is necessary and in the best interests of the child.

---

### I. PARTIES  

1. **Plaintiff:** Laura Thompson, mother of minor child Emily Reed, resides within Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the primary residential parent under the current judgment and shares legal custody with the Defendant. Contact: (617) 555‑0123 / psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Reed, father of the minor child, resides within Bristol County, Massachusetts. He shares legal custody and currently enjoys substantial parenting time, including overnights on weekends and Sunday nights.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under G.L. c. 215, § 6, and venue properly lies in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court**, as both parties and the minor child reside in Bristol County.

4. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody judgment when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior order, and a modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about **March 15, 2021**, this Court issued a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan awarding **shared legal custody** of the minor child, **Emily (age 10)**, to both parents, with **Laura Thompson** as the **primary residential parent**, and **Michael Reed** exercising substantial weekend parenting time, including overnight visits on **Sunday nights**.

6. The Judgment further provides that both parents **shall cooperate on school matters** and **keep each other informed** regarding the child’s educational and developmental needs.

7. At the time of the Judgment, Emily was performing well in school, with regular attendance and satisfactory grades.

8. Over the past year, the Defendant has **repeatedly kept the child home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time**, asserting that Emily needs a “mental health day.” These absences have **not been supported by medical documentation** or authorized by the school or a healthcare provider.

9. As a result of these absences, the child’s **school attendance record has deteriorated**, and the family has received **truancy warnings** from the school district.

10. The Defendant has also routinely **failed to bring Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions** that occur during his parenting time, despite prior agreement between the parents and the child’s teacher that such tutoring is necessary for her academic progress.

11. Since these events began, **Emily's academic performance has declined**, including drops in grades and standardized test scores.

12. The Defendant’s consistent disregard of the child’s educational obligations and of the parties’ duty to cooperate on school matters constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** adversely affecting the child’s best interests.

13. The Plaintiff has made multiple attempts to communicate and resolve these issues cooperatively, but the Defendant has remained unwilling to modify his practices.

14. The current parenting schedule, insofar as it grants the Defendant overnights on school nights and equal decision-making authority regarding school attendance, is **no longer serving the child’s best interests** under G.L. c. 208, § 28.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES  

15. A “material and substantial change in circumstances” justifying modification exists when conditions that formed the basis of the original judgment have altered such that enforcement of the prior order would no longer serve the child’s welfare. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

16. Massachusetts law provides that the best interests of the child remain the paramount consideration in modification proceedings. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); **Pierce v. Pierce**, 455 Mass. 286 (2009).

17. Substantial, unexcused school absences and educational decline constitute a significant change affecting the child’s welfare under *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), and *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

18. A parent’s failure to cooperate regarding educational decisions and adherence to the original parenting order further supports modification. *See* **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); **Cooper v. Cooper**, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (2004).

19. Where a shared legal custody arrangement becomes “unworkable or detrimental to the child’s welfare,” modification to grant one parent final decision-making authority, or to adjust physical custody, is appropriate. *See* **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION  

20. The Plaintiff seeks relief consistent with the best interests of the child, as established by *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and cases interpreting that statute.

21. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the Court:  
   a. **Modify the existing custody order** to provide that the Plaintiff, **Laura Thompson**, shall have **sole or final decision-making authority with respect to the child’s educational and attendance matters**, or  
   b. **Alternatively**, modify the parenting schedule to **eliminate the Defendant’s Sunday overnight** parenting time (thus returning the child to the Plaintiff’s care Sunday evenings) or otherwise **reduce school‑night overnights** with the Defendant, so as to ensure consistent school attendance.

22. The Plaintiff requests any additional orders that the Court deems just and proper to serve the **best interests of the minor child**, including clarifying the parties’ duties regarding educational cooperation and school attendance.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Laura Thompson**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the March 15, 2021 custody judgment;  
2. Modify the custody order to grant Plaintiff **final decision-making authority concerning the child’s school attendance and educational matters**, or alternatively, to reduce school-night overnights with the Defendant;  
3. Order that both parents ensure prompt, regular school attendance consistent with state law and school policy;  
4. Award the Plaintiff such other relief as equity and justice may require.
