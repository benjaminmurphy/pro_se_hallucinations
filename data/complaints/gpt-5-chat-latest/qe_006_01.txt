Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Mark Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

Civil Action No.: ________

---

### **COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

#### **I. INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against her landlord, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), for breach of the statutory and common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment arising out of Defendant’s prolonged failure to restore hot water service to Plaintiff’s rental apartment located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

---

#### **II. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 25 Cedar Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, MA 02302.  
2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual with a principal business address, upon information and belief, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, MA 02302 (“the Premises”).

---

#### **III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction under G.L. c. 218, §19, as this action arises under Massachusetts law and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department because the rental premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred therein.  

---

#### **IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant for the rental of the Premises for a monthly rent of $1,500.  
6. In late November 2025, the hot water service in the Premises ceased functioning. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the loss of hot water.  
7. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part and that it had been ordered.  
8. For the following three weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly contacted Defendant regarding the lack of hot water. Defendant consistently responded that the part was “backordered” and that repair would have to await its arrival.  
9. As of December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water for approximately three weeks.  
10. During this period, Plaintiff has been compelled to take cold showers, boil water for washing dishes, and use external facilities.  
11. Plaintiff incurred additional expenses, including approximately $30 per month for a gym membership to shower and additional travel costs to and from her mother’s home to bathe her infant child.  
12. The lack of hot water rendered the apartment substantially unsuitable for habitation and interfered materially with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  
13. Defendant, as landlord, had both statutory and contractual obligations to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition, including providing adequate hot water.  
14. Defendant’s failure to repair the hot water system for an extended period constitutes a termination of Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14.  
15. Plaintiff has performed all obligations required under her tenancy, including timely payment of rent.

#### **V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises shall be liable for damages of not less than one month’s rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment ensures that a tenant shall not be disturbed in her possession and beneficial use of leased premises. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 715–17 (1977); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982).  
19. A landlord’s substantial failure to provide essential services such as heat or hot water constitutes a breach of the covenant. *See* **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).  
20. A prolonged lack of hot water has been held to materially interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. *See* **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  
21. The landlord’s good intentions or efforts to repair do not excuse the deprivation where the result is a serious interference with habitability. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 718–19; **Arsenault v. Chicopee Hous. Auth.**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 939 (1983).  
22. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water for more than three weeks constituted a substantial, ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
23. Defendant’s actions and inaction directly violated Plaintiff’s statutory rights under G.L. c. 186, §14, and related case law.  
24. Deficiencies in essential services like hot water also breach the implied warranty of habitability, further evidencing a violation of the quiet enjoyment covenant. *See* **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
25. Massachusetts sanitary code regulations require landlords to provide hot and cold running water in every dwelling. *See* 105 C.M.R. §410.190(A). The violation of such code provisions supports a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment. *See* **McKenna v. Begin**, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308 (1977).  
26. Therefore, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages permitted under G.L. c. 186, §14, including at least one month’s rent ($1,500) or actual damages, whichever is greater.  

---

#### **VI. DAMAGES**

27. Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses, inconvenience, and interference with daily life due to Defendant’s failure to maintain hot water.  
28. Plaintiff estimates her actual damages, including lost use, out‑of‑pocket costs (gym membership, travel expenses), and discomfort, to be approximately $450; however, under G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to a statutory minimum of one month’s rent ($1,500).  
29. Plaintiff also seeks all allowable statutory costs, interest, and attorney’s fees even though she is self‑represented.  

---

#### **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages of not less than one month’s rent ($1,500) or actual damages, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff costs of this action and such reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by statute;  
D. Order any further relief as justice and equity require.

---

#### **VIII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under Massachusetts law.
