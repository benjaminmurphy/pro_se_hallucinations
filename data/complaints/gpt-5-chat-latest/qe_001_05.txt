v.

Defendant.  

Civil Action No. ____________

### VERIFIED COMPLAINT  
*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)*

---

**Plaintiff, Jessica Hartley**, brings this complaint against Defendant, Robert Thompson, and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Hartley** (“Plaintiff”) resides at and rents a two-bedroom apartment located at **27 Wilcock Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124** (“the Premises”).  

2. Defendant **Robert Thompson** (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, the owner and landlord of the Premises.  

3. The tenancy began on or about **June 1, 2022**, pursuant to a written rental agreement requiring Plaintiff to pay **$1,800 per month** in rent.  

4. This Court has **subject matter jurisdiction** under **G.L. c. 185C, § 3** (granting the Housing Court jurisdiction over all actions involving the health, safety, or welfare of occupants of residential housing, including actions arising under G.L. c. 186).  

5. Venue is proper in the **Boston Housing Court** because the leased premises is located within Suffolk County and within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

---

## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. During the **winter of 2024–2025**, the heating system serving Plaintiff’s apartment repeatedly failed to maintain adequate indoor temperatures.  

7. On multiple occasions, temperatures in Plaintiff’s unit dropped to approximately **60 degrees Fahrenheit** for extended periods, especially in the evenings.  

8. Defendant was promptly notified of each heating failure and, on two occasions, sent repair personnel to inspect and attempt repairs.  

9. Although each repair temporarily improved the situation, the heating problem recurred shortly thereafter.  

10. The second repair technician admitted that the building’s **boiler was “old but functional”** and provided no further corrective action.  

11. As a result of the continuing heating deficiencies, Plaintiff was forced to purchase **two electric space heaters** to make the apartment habitable, incurring approximately **$150 per month in additional electricity costs** for several months.  

12. The inadequate heat caused Plaintiff undue distress and discomfort, interfered with her reasonable use and enjoyment of the apartment, and impacted her health and well-being.  

13. In **January 2025**, Plaintiff contracted bronchitis that her treating physician attributed, in part, to cold indoor air exposure. Plaintiff missed approximately **three days of work** and incurred medical costs related to treatment and medications.  

14. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant has failed to remedy the chronic heating deficiencies, insisting that the system is “working” because it never goes completely out.  

15. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an **unreasonable interference** with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and a violation of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.

---

## III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

16. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully restated herein.  

17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of any residential premises” and any such interference entitles the tenant to **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.  

18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment ensures that tenants can peaceably occupy their premises without substantial interference from the landlord or conditions under the landlord’s control.  

19. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that **failure to provide adequate heat or essential utilities** constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, even absent deliberate wrongdoing.  
   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977)**.  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982)**.  
   - *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994)**.  
   - *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, **379 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1979)**.  
   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997)**.  
   - *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, **410 Mass. 855, 869–70 (1991)**.  
   - *Leardi v. Brown*, **394 Mass. 151, 158–59 (1985)**.  
   - *Hilder v. St. Peter*, **144 Vt. 150 (1984)** (persuasive authority on habitability and quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Youghal, LLC v. Entwistle*, **Mass. App. Ct. No. 18-P-143, 2019 WL 1239874 (Mar. 19, 2019)** (unreported) (failure to maintain heating constitutes interference).  
   - *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, **363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973)**.

20. Pursuant to these authorities and **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, a landlord’s failure to maintain essential services, including adequate heat, may give rise to both damages and rent abatement.  

21. Defendant’s failure to ensure consistent and habitable heating, despite repeated notice, constitutes **an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

22. Defendant’s acts and omissions have caused Plaintiff:  
   - Economic losses in the form of additional electricity expenses totaling approximately **$450**.  
   - Health-related costs and lost wages due to illness of approximately **$200**.  
   - Housing distress, discomfort, and inconvenience valued at least at **$650**, which Plaintiff seeks in damages, subject to the statutory minimum of three months’ rent if greater.  

23. Plaintiff is entitled to **actual damages, or three months’ rent ($5,400), whichever is greater, plus costs and any allowable attorney’s fees** under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

---

## IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Hartley** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and declare that Defendant **Robert Thompson** breached the **covenant of quiet enjoyment** in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **damages equal to the greater of her actual losses ($650) or three months’ rent ($5,400)**;  
C. Award **statutory costs** and **reasonable attorney’s fees** (if counsel later appears);  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
