**MARIA TORRES,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**JAMES CARTER,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Maria Torres**, and respectfully files this *Complaint for Modification* pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28*, *G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, and the equitable powers of this Honorable Court. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Maria Torres**, resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and primary custodial parent of the minor child, **Sophia Carter**, age 9.

2. The Defendant, **James Carter**, is the father of the minor child. Upon information and belief, the Defendant presently resides in or intends to relocate to New Hampshire for employment purposes.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and *G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, as it issued the original custody and parenting order on **May 15, 2021**.

4. Venue in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court, Cambridge Division** is proper, as the original order was issued here, and the child continues to reside in Middlesex County.

---

## **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

5. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court entered a final judgment governing physical and legal custody of the parties’ child, **Sophia Carter**, providing that Maria Torres would have **primary physical custody**, and that James Carter would have **parenting time each Wednesday overnight and every other weekend**.

6. The existing schedule was structured around both parents residing in or near **Cambridge, Massachusetts**, and the child attending the local school in that community.

7. Since entry of the judgment, the Defendant has **secured employment in New Hampshire** and has **expressed his intent to relocate** there. The commute between the Defendant’s new residence and the child’s school is approximately **ninety minutes each way**, depending on traffic.

8. The Defendant has stated his desire to **maintain the existing parenting schedule** despite this move, including midweek overnight visitation.

9. The midweek overnights would require the child to **travel long distances late at night and before school**, with resulting early morning wake-ups, fatigue, and interference with homework and extracurricular commitments.

10. The extended travel has already begun to cause **anxiety and exhaustion** for the child, who has expressed **distress about missing after-school activities and spending long periods in the car**.

11. These changes in the parents’ living situation, commute patterns, and the child’s developmental and educational needs constitute a **material change in circumstances** affecting the child’s best interests.

---

## **IV. LEGAL STANDARD**

12. Under *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and pertinent case law, a custody or parenting plan may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the prior judgment, and where modification is **in the best interests of the child**. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

13. The best interests of the child are paramount in all custody determinations. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

14. A court must evaluate the totality of circumstances, including the child’s emotional well-being, educational stability, and the feasibility of the parenting schedule. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

15. When a parent relocates to a significantly different geographic area that impacts the child’s routine and schooling, such relocation constitutes a **material change** justifying modification. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

16. The Court may adjust parental access to balance the child’s need for stability with continued meaningful contact with both parents. *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

17. Courts have recognized that schedules resulting in excessive travel, late nights, or interference with school and extracurricular activities may not serve the child’s best interests. *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012); *Malachi M. v. Quincy M.*, 484 Mass. 247 (2020).

18. The Plaintiff’s requested modification is narrowly tailored and seeks only to reduce disruption to the child’s schooling, emotional stability, and routine, consistent with established Massachusetts precedent.

---

## **V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

19. The Defendant’s relocation to another state since the original custody judgment constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances.

20. The relocation renders the existing parenting schedule **unworkable and contrary to the child’s best interests**, particularly given the burdensome weekday commute and the child’s age and developmental stage.

21. The Plaintiff has acted in good faith in bringing this Complaint, focusing on the child’s welfare and not on restricting contact between father and child.

---

## **VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

22. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. **Eliminate** the **midweek (Wednesday) overnight** parenting time due to the extended commute and detrimental impact on the child’s schooling and well-being;  

   b. **Modify** the weekend parenting time to **alternate weekends (Friday after school to Sunday at 6:00 p.m.)** or such other schedule as the Court determines appropriate;  

   c. Confirm that holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time shall be adjusted equitably to maintain meaningful and continuing father–child contact; and  

   d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

## **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Maria Torres, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the May 15, 2021 custody judgment;  
2. Modify the existing custody and parenting plan to eliminate midweek overnights and adjust weekend visitation as set forth above;  
3. Issue temporary orders as necessary to protect the child’s best interests pending final adjudication; and  
4. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and appropriate.
