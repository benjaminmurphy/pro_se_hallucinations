**Docket No. [To Be Assigned]**

**JESSICA TAYLOR,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL DAVIS,**  
Defendant.  

---

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor**, and pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related provisions, respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and visitation order entered on **March 15, 2021**, on the grounds that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the best interests of the minor child, **Sophie Davis (age 8)**. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states the following:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **Jessica Taylor**, resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is the mother and primary custodial parent of the minor child, Sophie Davis.

2. Defendant, **Michael Davis**, currently resides in or is preparing to relocate to New Hampshire, and is the father of the minor child, Sophie Davis.

3. The parties were previously before this Court in **Middlesex Probate and Family Court, Cambridge, Massachusetts**, resulting in the issuance of a custody and visitation order dated **March 15, 2021**.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10–11**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as this Court retains continuing jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters concerning the minor child.

5. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to **Mass. Prob. Ct. Standing Order 1-04** and **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, §§ 2–3**, as the original order was issued here and Plaintiff and the child reside within the Middlesex Division.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On March 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody and parenting plan granting Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, with Defendant to have parenting time each Wednesday and on alternating weekends.

7. The existing parenting plan was based upon both parents residing in close geographical proximity within Cambridge, Massachusetts, allowing for feasible weekday exchanges and reasonable commute times to and from the child’s school.

8. Defendant has now obtained a new employment opportunity in **New Hampshire** and intends to relocate approximately 90 minutes away (one-way) from the child’s school and home.

9. Defendant proposes to maintain the **existing midweek overnight and alternating weekend schedule** despite the relocation.

10. As a result of the proposed move and associated travel times, the existing schedule would require the child to engage in lengthy commutes on school nights, disrupt established routines, reduce sleep, and interfere with after-school activities, all of which are contrary to the child’s best interests.

11. Since Defendant’s relocation plans were not contemplated at the time of the prior judgment, these facts constitute a **material change in circumstances** warranting modification under Massachusetts law.

12. Plaintiff has observed increased **stress and anxiety** in the child as a result of discussions about the lengthy drives and disruption to her activities.

13. Plaintiff believes continued midweek overnights would cause emotional and physical strain on the minor child and impair her academic and social stability.

14. Plaintiff seeks a modification eliminating the midweek overnight and adjusting the weekend schedule to more appropriately reflect the parties’ current geographic circumstances while preserving the child’s relationship with both parents.

---

### **IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or visitation order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a finding that modification serves the child’s best interests.

16. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that a **parent’s relocation or significant change in living circumstances** constitutes a material change justifying modification. *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (relocation substantially affects parenting plan); **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (long-distance moves necessitate reevaluation of parenting schedules).

17. The standard of review focuses on **the best interests of the child**, as reaffirmed in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); and **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).

18. Massachusetts law recognizes that substantial increases in travel burdens or disruption of school or activity schedules may constitute a material change. *See* **Miller v. Miller**, 478 Mass. 642 (2018); **Williams v. Pitney**, 409 Mass. 449 (1991); **Wakefield v. Hegarty**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 772 (2006).

19. The child’s welfare must predominate over parental convenience or parental rights. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

20. Here, Defendant’s relocation to another state significantly alters the conditions assumed at the time of the prior order and undermines the practicality of the current parenting plan.

21. Continuing the midweek overnight would cause undue hardship and stress for the child due to extended commutes and interference with her school and extracurricular schedule—factors courts consider central to the best interests analysis. *See* **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).

22. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to minimize disruption while ensuring continued strong contact between Sophie and her father consistent with the child’s best interests.

### **V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior custody and parenting order on March 15, 2021;

B. **Modify** the existing custody and visitation order to eliminate the Wednesday overnight visitation, replacing it with an extended weekend schedule (e.g., every other weekend from Friday after school through Sunday evening or a similar arrangement consistent with the child’s best interests);

C. **Clarify** that all transportation arrangements must minimize the child’s commuting burden and ensure school attendance and after-school activity participation;

D. **Grant such other and further relief** as this Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the minor child.
