---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant share a common driveway and fence at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
6. On numerous occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant about the tall aluminum extension ladder Defendant habitually leaned unsecured against the wooden fence adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area.  
7. Plaintiff warned Defendant that the ladder, because of its height, weight, and position, posed a risk of falling during windy conditions.  
8. Defendant acknowledged these concerns and stated he would tie down or relocate the ladder.  
9. Despite these assurances, Defendant failed to take any reasonable or protective measures to secure the ladder.  
10. On March 15, 2023, a windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, while Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the shared driveway, the unsecured aluminum ladder fell from its resting position against the fence.  
11. The ladder struck Plaintiff’s vehicle, specifically the hood and windshield, causing substantial property damage.  
12. The vehicle sustained a dented hood and a cracked windshield and required professional repair, repainting, and windshield replacement.  
13. Plaintiff’s insurance covered part of the repairs, but she was required to pay her deductible and incur rental car charges for alternate transportation during the one-week repair period.  
14. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to secure or relocate the ladder, after being directly warned of the foreseeable risk, was a breach of his duty of care to maintain his property in a reasonably safe condition.  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage, economic loss, and inconvenience.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, a person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating or maintaining conditions that pose an unreasonable risk of harm to others lawfully on or near his property. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, his neighbor sharing the same premises, a duty of reasonable care in maintaining property under his control to prevent foreseeable injuries or damage to Plaintiff’s person or property. *See* **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988); **Black v. Coastal Oil New England, Inc.**, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 461 (1998).  
19. Defendant breached this duty by failing to secure or store the ladder in a safe manner despite multiple warnings and the known likelihood of high winds in March in Springfield, Massachusetts. *See* **Greene v. DiFazio**, 148 Mass. 25 (1888) (foreseeable hazard from unattended equipment).  
20. The harm was reasonably foreseeable; an unsecured ladder leaning against a fence in a shared driveway exposed others, including Plaintiff, to a known risk of injury or property damage. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty to guard against foreseeable misuse of dangerous items).  
21. Defendant’s failure to act was negligent as a matter of law under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, governing contributory negligence and reasonable care standards, and **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 283–284** (duty to act as a reasonable person under similar circumstances).  
22. Plaintiff was at all times acting with reasonable care and did not contribute to the occurrence or the resulting damages. *See* **Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.**, 388 Mass. 342 (1983).  
23. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage and economic loss. *See* **Joye v. Lee**, 175 Mass. 80 (1900); **Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston**, 365 Mass. 320 (1974).  
24. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered damages including: (a) the cost of property repairs; (b) payment of her insurance deductible; (c) car rental expenses; and (d) loss of use of her vehicle for approximately one week.  
25. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of his duty to act as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances, as defined by Massachusetts negligence law. *See* **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401 (1991); **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47 (1983).  
26. Plaintiff therefore seeks recovery of all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent maintenance and storage of the ladder.

---

### V. DAMAGES

27. Plaintiff estimates her property damage, deductible, and related rental costs total approximately **$3,500**, to be proven at trial.  
28. Plaintiff also seeks any additional consequential or incidental damages permitted under Massachusetts law, along with interest and costs under **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B & 6C**.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;  
B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$3,500**, plus interest, costs, and attorney’s fees as allowed by law;  
C. Award statutory interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable under the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.
