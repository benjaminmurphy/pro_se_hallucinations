### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; c. 209C, § 20; c. 215, § 6)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith** (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, chapters 208, section 28; chapter 209C, section 20; and all other applicable provisions of law, to **modify the existing custody order** entered by this Court on **May 15, 2021**, in order to safeguard the best interests and welfare of the minor child, **Michael Johnson**, born [DOB omitted].  

The Plaintiff seeks a modification of parenting time and custodial conditions based upon **a material and substantial change in circumstances** that has arisen since the prior Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time was entered.

---

**II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Jennifer Smith, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Telephone: (617) 555‑0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** David Johnson, residing in [address unknown to Plaintiff at this time], Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  
3. **Minor Child:** Michael Johnson, age eight (8), child of the Plaintiff and Defendant.

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. Jurisdiction and venue properly lie in the **Norfolk County Probate and Family Court**, as both parties reside within the Commonwealth and the original custody and visitation order was entered by this Court. See *M.G.L. c. 215, § 6*; *M.G.L. c. 208, § 28*; *M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20*.  

---

**IV. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER**

5. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court issued a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** awarding the parties **shared legal custody** of their minor child, Michael Johnson.  
6. That Judgment provided that the child primarily reside with Plaintiff Jennifer Smith, with scheduled visitation by the Defendant, David Johnson, during alternating weekends and certain other times.  
7. At the time of the Judgment, the Court found both parents to be stable and cooperative, and that shared legal custody with liberal parenting time with both parents served the child’s best interests.

---

**V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the prior order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** concerning the Defendant and the child’s well‑being.  
9. The child has recently disclosed to the Plaintiff statements that indicate potential substance abuse in the Defendant’s household, including references to “special drinks” and that the Defendant “can’t walk straight.”  
10. A neighbor who is familiar with both parties provided the Plaintiff a video showing the Defendant stumbling while attempting to remove the child from a vehicle late at night.  
11. In addition, the child’s school has notified the Plaintiff that the child frequently arrives **exhausted and irritable** on Monday mornings following weekends spent with the Defendant.  
12. The cumulative effect of these events raises **serious concerns for the safety, health, and emotional well‑being** of the child.  
13. These facts constitute a **significant and material change** since the date of the May 15, 2021 order, warranting modification under *M.G.L. c. 208, § 28* and consistent with Massachusetts case law.

---

**VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

14. Under *M.G.L. c. 208, § 28* and *M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, the Court may modify a custody or parenting time order upon a demonstration of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and when the proposed modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  

15. The best interests standard is paramount under Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

16. A material change affecting parental fitness or the child’s welfare justifies review and modification. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006).  

17. Ongoing or emerging evidence of substance abuse, impaired supervision, or neglect meets the threshold for a substantial change of circumstances. See *Adoption of Carlos*, 413 Mass. 339 (1992); *Care and Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).  

18. Allegations supported by observable conduct or corroborating evidence provide sufficient grounds for the Court to review parenting arrangements to protect the child’s best interests. See *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007); *Guardianship of V.V.*, 470 Mass. 590 (2015).  

19. The Court has broad equitable authority to **impose supervised visitation or specific conditions** on parenting time to ensure child safety while maintaining appropriate contact with both parents. See *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

20. Modification proceedings must balance parental rights with the child’s best interests, but the child’s safety and stability are paramount. See *Care and Protection of Erin*, 443 Mass. 567 (2005); *Adoption of Vincent*, 431 Mass. 703 (2000).  

21. Based upon these authorities and the factual allegations herein, continuation of the current parenting schedule without modification **poses a risk to the minor child’s welfare** and no longer serves the child’s best interests.

**VII. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Smith**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the May 15, 2021 custody order;  
B. Modify the existing Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time to provide that:  
   1. The Defendant’s overnight visits with the minor child be **temporarily suspended or made subject to supervision** by an appropriate third party or professional visitation center until the Defendant demonstrates that he is sober and capable of safe parenting;  
   2. The Defendant be required to **refrain from consuming alcohol or controlled substances** for at least twenty‑four (24) hours prior to and during any parenting time;  
   3. The Defendant participate in an appropriate **substance abuse evaluation and any recommended treatment**;  
   4. The Defendant’s parenting time be scheduled at hours that ensure the child obtains adequate rest before school days;  
   5. The Court order such **additional safeguards** as are necessary to protect the best interests and emotional well‑being of the minor child; and  
   6. For such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
