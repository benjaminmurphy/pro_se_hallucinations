# COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G. L. c. 208, § 28; G. L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Sarah Mitchell** (“Plaintiff”), resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of **Emma Mitchell**, a minor child born [DOB omitted for privacy], currently age 12.  
2. The Defendant, **John Mitchell** (“Defendant”), also resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.  
3. This is a Complaint for Modification brought pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, which authorizes the Probate and Family Court to modify judgments relating to custody when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and such modification is in the best interests of the child.

---

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court issued the original custody judgment on **May 15, 2019**, granting the parties shared legal custody and equal (50/50) physical custody of Emma Mitchell on an alternating week basis.  
5. Venue is proper in the **Norfolk County Probate and Family Court**, as both parties reside within the county and the original judgment was entered here.  
6. The Court has continuing jurisdiction under **G. L. c. 208, § 28** and **G. L. c. 215, § 6** to modify its prior orders based on changes affecting the welfare of the minor child.

---

**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

7. At the time the existing custody order was entered in 2019, both parents resided within close proximity, were healthy, and equally capable of meeting Emma’s daily needs. The alternating-week arrangement functioned well for several years, providing Emma with stability and consistent routines.  
8. In 2025, Defendant was diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that significantly affects his mobility and physical functioning.  
9. Defendant has since experienced multiple falls at home, uses a wheelchair, and has been medically advised not to be alone with the child in environments that require quick physical responses (e.g., around stairs, kitchens, or public places without assistance).  
10. Despite medical limitations, Defendant continues to adhere to the same 50/50 physical custody schedule and regularly relies on the parties’ twelve-year-old daughter to assist him in physically demanding tasks—including helping him transfer from wheelchair to bed, retrieving objects, and providing assistance beyond the capacity appropriate for a child.  
11. The Plaintiff has expressed concern for the child’s emotional and physical well-being given Defendant’s health condition, the increasing safety risks, and the strain on the child caused by acting in a caregiver role.  
12. The Plaintiff has offered to modify the schedule so that Emma resides primarily with her, while maintaining meaningful parenting time for Defendant that reflects his health and capacities. Defendant has declined.  
13. The foregoing constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor child since the entry of the 2019 Judgment.

**IV. ARGUMENT AND LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

14. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify an existing custody order “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”  
15. Massachusetts law recognizes that a modification of custody requires a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that such modification must serve the **best interests of the child.** *See* **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
16. The Defendant’s progressive neurological disease constitutes a “material and substantial change” that directly impacts his ability to safely care for the child without assistance. *See* **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (illness or disability affecting parenting capacity can justify modification).  
17. The best interests standard is paramount in custody determinations. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).  
18. When a parent’s physical capacity endangers or unduly burdens the child, courts have modified custody to protect the child’s welfare. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **M.P.M. v. D.M.,** 442 Mass. 39 (2004).  
19. The child’s forced role as caretaker is contrary to her developmental needs and the policy against parentification. *See* **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1034 (1999).  
20. The requested modification ensures both parents remain involved while adapting parenting time to meet changing circumstances, consistent with *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016).  
21. The Court’s continuing jurisdiction to modify judgments in domestic relations matters derives from **G.L. c. 215, § 6** and **G.L. c. 208, § 28**.  
22. The Plaintiff’s proposal serves the purposes of both stability and safety, as emphasized in **Custody of a Minor (No. 2)**, 392 Mass. 719 (1984), and **Bluhm v. Bluhm**, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 121 (2018).  
23. Public policy favors fostering a stable and nurturing environment for children consistent with a parent’s ability to provide safe care. *See* **Adoption of Ilona**, 459 Mass. 53 (2011).

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Sarah Mitchell**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

B. **Modify** the existing custody order to grant **Sarah Mitchell primary physical custody** of the minor child, **Emma Mitchell**, with appropriate parenting time for **John Mitchell**, consistent with his health and the child’s safety and best interests;  
C. **Maintain joint legal custody** of the minor child, unless the Court deems otherwise;  
D. **Establish a revised parenting schedule** that maximizes the child’s stability and safety while promoting ongoing, meaningful contact with both parents;  
E. **Grant any further relief** as is just and proper under the laws and equity of the Commonwealth.
