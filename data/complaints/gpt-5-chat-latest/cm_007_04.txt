**Docket No. [________]**

**EMILY JOHNSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK SMITH**,  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, and respectfully files this **Complaint for Modification** of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on **March 12, 2019**, in the above-captioned matter. In support thereof, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff, Emily Johnson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her phone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant, Mark Smith**, also resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the natural parents of **Sophia Smith**, born [date omitted for privacy], age twelve (12).

---

### II. PRIOR ORDER

4. On or about **March 12, 2019**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** granting the parties shared **50/50 physical and legal custody** of their minor child, Sophia Smith, on a week‑on/week‑off rotating schedule.  
5. At the time of that judgment, both parents lived in close proximity, were in good health, and were able to care for the child in comparable home environments.  
6. For several years, the schedule functioned well and supported the child’s academic, emotional, and social development.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the March 12, 2019 order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the child.  
8. Specifically, in the past year, **Defendant Mark Smith** has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition**.  
9. As a result of this condition, Defendant experiences periodic loss of balance, muscle weakness, and has suffered multiple falls at home.  
10. Defendant’s treating physician has advised that he should not be left alone with the child in environments requiring quick physical reaction (e.g., stairways, bathing, cooking).  
11. Despite these medical limitations, Defendant continues to insist on maintaining the full 50/50 arrangement and often asks the child, age twelve, to assist him physically—helping transfer him from a wheelchair to bed and retrieving necessities.  
12. These circumstances place the minor child in a caregiving role that is **unsafe and inappropriate** for her age and directly implicate her best interests.  
13. Plaintiff has attempted to reach a cooperative adjustment in schedule for the safety of the child, but informal efforts have been unsuccessful.  
14. The facts described constitute a **material and substantial change** rendering the prior parenting arrangement inconsistent with the best interests of the child.

### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a custody judgment upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a finding that modification is in the child’s best interests.  
16. Similarly, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** empowers this Court to modify custody or visitation on a showing that the child’s best interests so require.  
17. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, **395 Mass. 704** (1985) (best interests of the child govern custody determinations).  
18. See *Mason v. Coleman*, **447 Mass. 177** (2006) (material change standard protects stability while permitting necessary revisions).  
19. See *Williams v. Massa*, **431 Mass. 619** (2000) (unforeseen circumstances warrant modification of physical custody).  
20. See *Smith v. McDonald*, **458 Mass. 540** (2010) (shared custody may be modified where health issues affect parenting capacity).  
21. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, **51 Mass. App. Ct. 257** (2001) (court must consider whether the child is subject to stress or unsafe conditions under present order).  
22. See *Custody of Kali*, **439 Mass. 834** (2003) (stability is important but subordinate to a child’s safety and best interests).  
23. See *Hersey v. Hersey*, **271 Mass. 545** (1930) (court may revise custody if parent’s condition changes adversely).  
24. See *Adoption of Hugo*, **428 Mass. 219** (1998) (health and capacity of custodial parent are central factors).  
25. See *Care & Protection of Two Minors*, **396 Mass. 610** (1986) (the child’s welfare is the paramount concern).  
26. See *Brooks v. Piela*, **61 Mass. App. Ct. 731** (2004) (parent’s medical impairment can warrant change to ensure proper supervision and safety).  
27. Collectively, these statutes and precedents authorize this Court to revise the current order to promote Sophia’s welfare and to ensure that custodial arrangements align with the present realities of each parent’s capabilities.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

28. Plaintiff requests that the Court **modify the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** entered March 12, 2019, as follows:

   a. **Physical Custody:** That the Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, be designated **primary physical custodian** of the minor child, **Sophia Smith**.  
   b. **Parenting Time:** That the Defendant, **Mark Smith**, have **liberal and reasonable parenting time** consistent with his current health and physical abilities, and as recommended by his medical professionals.  
   c. **Legal Custody:** That the parties continue to share **joint legal custody**, communicating in good faith concerning the child’s education, health care, and wellbeing.  
   d. **Further Relief:** That the Court grant such additional relief as is just and proper to protect the child’s best interests.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Determine that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the prior order;  
2. Find that modification of physical custody and parenting time is in the **best interests of the child**;  
3. Enter a new parenting plan designating Plaintiff as **primary physical custodian** with appropriate parenting time for Defendant; and
