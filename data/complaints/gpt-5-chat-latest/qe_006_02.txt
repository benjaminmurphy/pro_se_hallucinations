**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

---

### I. PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff **Emily Carter** (“Plaintiff”) resides at 45 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  
2. Defendant **James Thompson** (“Defendant”) is an individual who owns and rents residential property located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the rental property and the acts and omissions at issue occurred in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

4. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, at a monthly rent of $1,200.  
5. Plaintiff remained a lawful tenant in good standing at all relevant times and paid rent as agreed.  
6. Beginning approximately three weeks prior to the date of this filing, the hot water system within the leased premises ceased functioning.  
7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the loss of hot water on the same day the problem began.  
8. Defendant stated that a part was required to repair the water heater and that it had been ordered; however, as of the date of filing, nearly a month later, the repair has not been completed and Plaintiff continues to lack hot water.  
9. Plaintiff has repeatedly communicated with Defendant, who acknowledged the problem but failed to restore hot water in a timely manner.  
10. As a result of the lack of hot water, Plaintiff has had to incur additional expenses, including approximately $30 per month for a gym membership to shower, transportation costs to the gym, and the inconvenience and expense of bathing her infant child at her mother’s home.  
11. Plaintiff has endured substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of her rental premises due to the continuing deprivation of hot water, a condition that constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied by law in all Massachusetts residential tenancies.  
12. The lack of hot water also constitutes a violation of the state sanitary code, **105 C.M.R. § 410.190**, which requires landlords to maintain facilities for heating water to a temperature of at least 110°F.  
13. Defendant’s failure to correct this condition within a reasonable time after notice is a breach of his statutory and common law obligations to provide habitable premises and not to interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the property.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
**Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises is liable for actual and consequential damages, and where the interference is intentional or reckless, up to three months’ rent or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater.  
16. Defendant’s failure to provide hot water for nearly a month after notice constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.  
17. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that denial of essential services, such as heat or hot water, amounts to a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See, e.g., Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Wolfberg v. Hunter*, 385 Mass. 390 (1982).  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from both affirmative acts and omissions by a landlord that result in serious interference with the use of leased premises. *See Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
19. Massachusetts law implies a warranty of habitability in every residential lease, requiring that the premises remain fit for human occupation. *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
20. The absence of hot water violates that warranty and thus constitutes an interference within the meaning of **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**. *See, e.g., Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 378 Mass. 758 (1979); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).*  
21. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated requests, Defendant has not remedied the condition, demonstrating reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s rights.  
22. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the estimated amount of **$450.00**, including out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use, and inconvenience.  
23. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Find that Defendant **James Thompson** violated **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14** by interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises through his failure to timely restore hot water;  
B. Award Plaintiff actual damages of $450.00 or, alternatively, three months’ rent ($3,600.00), whichever is greater, pursuant to statute;  
C. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and any reasonable legal expenses that may be incurred;
