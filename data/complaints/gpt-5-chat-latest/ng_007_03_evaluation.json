Pine Manor College as a whole is a leading Massachusetts case recognizing that a college that undertakes to provide security for its (largely minor) resident students owes a duty of reasonable care to protect them from foreseeable criminal acts. The majority opinion (not reproduced here) expressly grounds liability in the college\u2019s voluntary assumption of responsibility for students\u2019 safety and the foreseeability of harm, which is analogous to entities supervising children in their care. Because only the dissent is quoted, the support is not explicit in this excerpt, but the full case clearly supports the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Because the excerpt provided is solely Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissent on proximate cause, it does not contain the majority\u2019s duty analysis. In the full opinion, the court holds that Pine Manor College owed its student a duty to take reasonable measures to protect her against foreseeable criminal attacks, based on the college\u2019s undertaking to provide security and the students\u2019 reliance on that undertaking."

It does not involve the supervision or care of minor children, nor does it articulate any special duty arising from undertaking to supervise minors; thus it does not support the specific proposition about entities supervising minor children in their care.",

Coughlin v. Titus & Bean concerns an employer\u2019s alleged negligent hiring/supervision of an employee who murdered a child near a warehouse; it analyzes whether the employer owed any duty at all to the victim and ultimately holds that no such duty existed under the circumstances. The opinion does not involve an after-school program, child supervision duties, or any analogous custodial/special relationship imposing a duty to supervise children; instead, it rejects the existence of a duty to protect the victim, so it does not support the stated proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cHere, the motion judge ruled as matter of law that the defendant did not owe any duty to the victim. \u2026 In sum, a background check would not have provided any additional information that would have enabled Titus & Bean to reasonably foresee that Kelley posed a threat to members of the public at or near 385R Court Street. In any event, Kelley was to work alone at the warehouse and was not expected to have regular contact with the public in the normal course of business. Thus, in those circumstances, Titus & Bean could not have reasonably foreseen that Kelley posed a threat to members of the public, including the victim.\u201d"

Instead, the case turns on lack of proof of causation, not on elaborating the standard of care. Thus it does not serve as authority for the quoted definitional proposition.",

The court holds that no such duty exists under those circumstances and therefore there is no negligence; it does not state or apply a general standard that the defendant\u2019s breach here was negligent or that it constituted a failure to exercise reasonable care. Instead, it rejects the existence of a duty altogether, which is contrary to the proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAny liability on the defendant's part in such a situation must be grounded in the common law of negligence\u2026 meaning that the plaintiff has the burden of proving each and every element of that claim: duty, breach of duty (or, the element of negligence), causation (actual and proximate) and damages\u2026 Since no common law duty exists here, it follows that the statutes relied on by the plaintiff do not of themselves create a cause of action in tort.\u201d"

It does not involve children, rough play, or a failure to supervise children, nor does it discuss risks arising from unsupervised rough play among children.
