# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**Filed:** December 1, 2025

### **I. Introduction and Jurisdiction**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson** (“Mother”), brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28**, **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20**, and **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, § 6**, seeking modification of the existing custody and parenting order entered by this Court on **June 15, 2019**.

2. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters of custody and parenting time pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28**, **ch. 209C, § 20**, and relevant common law, as the original order was issued by the **Barnstable Probate and Family Court**.

3. Venue is proper in this Court because both parties are subject to this Court’s continuing jurisdiction and the minor child resides within its territorial jurisdiction.

5. **Defendant:** Michael Smith  
   Residence: [Address omitted for privacy; now located on Cape Cod, Massachusetts].  

6. The parties are the parents of one minor child: **Ava Smith**, born [date of birth omitted for privacy], who is presently eight (8) years old.

### **III. Background and Prior Orders**

7. On **June 15, 2019**, this Court entered a custody order granting **Jessica Thompson** primary physical custody of Ava Smith, with **Michael Smith** having parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on **Wednesdays**.

8. At the time the 2019 order was entered, both parties resided in the same town, allowing for easy transportation to and from school following the midweek overnight.

9. The parties have since abided by the 2019 order.

---

### **IV. Material Change in Circumstances**

10. In or about 2023, the Defendant **Michael Smith** relocated his residence to **Cape Cod, Massachusetts**, approximately **ninety (90) miles** from the Plaintiff and Ava’s primary residence.

11. Despite this relocation, the Defendant insists on exercising the **Wednesday overnight**, transporting Ava from school to Cape Cod after classes on Wednesday, then back to school early Thursday morning.

12. As a result, Ava routinely must wake up around **4:30 A.M.** on Thursdays in order to travel back for school. These lengthy drives cause her fatigue, reduced academic performance, and decreased school participation on Thursday mornings.

13. Ava’s teacher has noted that she is **consistently tired and less engaged** on Thursdays following these overnight visits, a clear indication that the current schedule is no longer serving her best interests.

14. The Defendant’s relocation constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that could not have been anticipated at the time the 2019 order was entered, rendering the midweek overnight impracticable and detrimental to Ava’s welfare.

15. Continuation of the existing midweek overnight schedule is inconsistent with **the child’s best interests**, the controlling standard under Massachusetts law.

---

### **V. Legal Standard and Supporting Authority**

16. Under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28**, orders concerning custody or parenting time may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that modification would serve the **best interests of the child**.

17. The Supreme Judicial Court has consistently held that a substantial change in either parent’s circumstances—such as a relocation—may justify modification of custody orders (*Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 [1996]; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 [2003]).

18. The “best interests of the child” remain paramount in all custody determinations (*Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 [1985]; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 [2001]; *Williams v. Pitney*, 409 Mass. 449 [1991]).

19. The Massachusetts Appeals Court recognizes that parenting plans must be practical and must not unreasonably disrupt a child’s daily routine or education (*Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 [2006]; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 [1981]).

20. Courts also find that evidence of fatigue, academic disruption, or significant travel burden on a child can justify withdrawing midweek overnights (*Macri v. Macri*, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 479 [2019]).

21. In addition, *Hassett v. Hassett*, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 515 (2011), confirms that relocation substantially affecting a child’s schooling and well-being satisfies the “material change” requirement for modification.

22. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), explains that where compliance with an existing parenting plan has become detrimental due to increased travel or changed living situations, modification is appropriate.

23. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), emphasizes that stability and continuity in school and daily life are essential components of the best‑interest analysis.

24. Further, under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 31**, both parents share responsibility for promoting the child’s welfare, and parenting plans must reflect realistic logistics supporting consistent schooling and rest.

---

### **VI. Requested Modification**

25. The Plaintiff requests that the Court **eliminate the midweek Wednesday overnight** due to the Defendant’s relocation and the adverse impact on the child’s schooling and well‑being.

26. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court adjust the weekend schedule, if necessary, to allow equivalent or reasonable parenting time that minimizes travel fatigue and disruption to the child’s educational routine.

27. The Plaintiff requests that all other provisions of the existing Judgment remain in full force and effect unless inconsistent with this modification.

---

### **VII. Relief Requested**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred due to the Defendant’s relocation and the resulting disruption to the child’s routine;  
B. Modify the June 15, 2019 custody order to remove the midweek overnight on Wednesdays;  
C. Adjust the parenting schedule in a manner consistent with the child’s best interests, including minimizing lengthy school‑night travel;  
D. Issue any further orders necessary to ensure the stability, rest, and educational welfare of the minor child, Ava Smith; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
