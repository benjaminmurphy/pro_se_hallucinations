### COMPLAINT

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”), through this Complaint, alleges that Defendant John Mitchell (“Defendant”), her landlord at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts, breached the statutory and common law covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteed to tenants under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs, and such further relief as this Court deems proper.

---

**II. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff **Sarah Thompson** resides and is a tenant at 123 Elm Street, Apartment [number], Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  
2. Defendant **John Mitchell** is an individual residing upon information and belief in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and lessor of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as the claims concern a residential tenancy and alleged violations of the Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Boston Municipal Court** because the leased premises are located within its territorial jurisdiction.  

---

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **January 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment at **123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA 02124**, for a monthly rent of **$1,800**.  

6. Throughout the winter of 2024–2025, the heating system in the apartment repeatedly failed to provide adequate and consistent heat.  

7. The temperature within Plaintiff’s unit frequently dropped to approximately **60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours**, especially in the evenings.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of these heating deficiencies. In response, Defendant sent repair personnel on two separate occasions.  

9. After the first repair, the heating system functioned temporarily but soon deteriorated again.  

10. The second repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was "old but functional" and that no further corrective work was contemplated.  

11. Despite Plaintiff’s continued complaints, Defendant failed to restore consistent and adequate heat as required by Massachusetts law and the terms of the tenancy.  

12. As a direct consequence of the inadequate heat, Plaintiff was compelled to purchase **two electric space heaters** to maintain a habitable temperature. The additional electricity usage increased Plaintiff’s electric bills by approximately **$150 per month** during the winter months.  

13. Plaintiff suffered **bronchitis in January 2025**, which her physician indicated was likely aggravated by the cold conditions inside the rental unit. Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred the cost of medical treatment and a course of antibiotics.  

14. Despite these circumstances, Defendant has continued to accept monthly rent and has refused to offer any rent abatement or reimbursement for Plaintiff’s expenses.  

15. Defendant’s conduct has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s beneficial enjoyment of her leased premises.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(**G.L. c. 186, § 14**)

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of leased residential premises. A breach occurs when the landlord’s actions—or failure to act—substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  

18. Defendant’s failure and refusal to maintain adequate heat in the premises—after notice of the defective conditions—constitutes a constructive interference in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and Massachusetts case law, including but not limited to:

   - **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable when actions substantially interfere with tenant’s use);  
   - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (noise and water leaks giving rise to breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Hemingway v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. of Boston**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing tenant’s right to habitable premises);  
   - **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (heating deficiencies and habitability issues constitute interference with quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth.**, 378 Mass. 758 (1979) (landlord liability for recurring, unremedied conditions);  
   - **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment protected from landlord’s acts or omissions);  
   - **Davis v. Comerford**, 483 Mass. 164 (2019) (affirming that negligent omissions causing loss of essential services can violate G.L. c. 186, § 14);  
   - **Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC**, 478 Mass. 697 (2018) (discussing substantial interference standard);  
   - **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (prolonged heat loss constitutes interference with quiet enjoyment); and  
   - **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (landlord’s failure to maintain building services interferes with quiet enjoyment).  

19. Defendant’s omission in failing to maintain proper heat constitutes at least negligent, and potentially willful, interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, as he knew of the ongoing problem and refused to rectify it.  

20. Defendant’s conduct resulted in Plaintiff’s loss of use and enjoyment of her home, increased expenses, physical illness, and emotional distress.  

21. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including but not limited to approximately **$600 in additional living expenses**, medical costs, and the diminished rental value of the premises.  

22. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent as statutory damages, whichever is greater, along with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant John Mitchell on all counts;  
B. Award Plaintiff **damages of $600 or three months’ rent ($5,400), whichever is greater**, as provided by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
C. Award Plaintiff reimbursement of her additional electricity and medical costs, and compensation for lost wages and suffering;  
D. Award Plaintiff her costs and any other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.
