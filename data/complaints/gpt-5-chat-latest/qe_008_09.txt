### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written residential tenancy agreement dated May 1, 2022, under which Plaintiff rented an apartment at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts, for $1,250 per month.  
6. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent timely and complied with all terms of her tenancy agreement.  
7. The common front entry door to the building has had a broken latch and lock for approximately two months prior to the filing of this complaint.  
8. As a result, the front door of the building does not properly secure, allowing unauthorized persons to enter the common area of the building without a key.  
9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the defective door at least two months ago; Defendant acknowledged the problem and promised to repair it, but has failed to do so.  
10. Plaintiff has reminded Defendant multiple times of the unsafe condition and requested that the door be repaired, but Defendant has taken no action.  
11. In November 2025, an unauthorized person entered the building and rifled through tenants’ mail; several tenants, including Plaintiff, experienced mail and package theft as a result.  
12. Plaintiff lost a package valued at approximately $120 as a result of the intrusion.  
13. Plaintiff has also discovered evidence indicating that someone has been sleeping in the basement area of the building without authorization, heightening her sense of insecurity in the premises.  
14. Plaintiff purchased a security camera for her unit door and installed a new deadbolt at her own expense, costing approximately $200, to protect her safety and personal property.  
15. Defendant has refused to acknowledge the gravity of the issue, indicating to Plaintiff that she was “overreacting” and asserting that the neighborhood is safe.  
16. Defendant’s failure to maintain a secure entryway has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of her rental premises, as guaranteed by Massachusetts law.  
17. Plaintiff has suffered pecuniary losses, including loss of property ($120), security expenses ($200), and emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, §14)**

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 17 above as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises shall be liable to the tenant for actual and consequential damages or, alternatively, for not less than three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
20. Defendant’s inaction and refusal to correct the defective exterior lock constituted an act of omission which foreseeably permitted unauthorized access to the building, thereby interfering with Plaintiff’s secure and peaceful enjoyment of her apartment.  
21. Defendant’s conduct violated the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized under Massachusetts law. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where actions or inactions cause substantial interference with tenant’s use and enjoyment); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (substantial interference with habitability and mental tranquility constitutes violation of covenant of quiet enjoyment).  
22. Defendant’s failure to act after repeated notice constitutes “direct or indirect interference” with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14.  
23. Defendant’s omission further violates public policy embodied in the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.480 and 410.750, which require landlords to maintain doors and locks in good repair and in a condition safe for tenants. See *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985).  
24. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a landlord’s failure to correct security or maintenance problems after notice can support a claim under G.L. c. 186, §14. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); *Farrah v. Peabody Props., Inc.*, 19 Mass. L. Rptr. 32 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2005).  
25. The defendant’s conduct also constitutes negligence per se under the State Sanitary Code, further supporting the inference of substantial interference. See *Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 363 Mass. 359 (1973).  
26. Defendant’s breach of duty resulted in damages to Plaintiff, including financial losses and emotional distress arising from repeated intrusions and insecurity in her home.

### V. DAMAGES

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has sustained losses including:  
   a. Loss of stolen property ($120);  
   b. Cost of personal security improvements ($200); and  
   c. Emotional distress, insecurity, and disturbance of peaceable possession, reasonably valued at not less than $320 total and subject to statutory enhancement.  
28. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to either three months’ rent ($3,750) or her actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Hartman** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Michael Thompson**, and award the following relief:

A. A finding that Defendant violated G.L. c. 186, §14 by breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Damages in an amount not less than three months’ rent ($3,750) or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater;  
C. Reimbursement of actual losses in the amount of $320;  
D. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as provided by G.L. c. 186, §14;  
E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
