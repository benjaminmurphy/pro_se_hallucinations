**EMMA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**DAVID MILLER,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and Related Authority)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Emma Thompson** (“Mother”), resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, **Sophia Miller**, age 10.  
2. The Defendant, **David Miller** (“Father”), resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the child’s father.  
3. This Court retains continuing jurisdiction over matters relating to custody and parenting time pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and related provisions governing custody of minor children.  
4. The original Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time was entered by this Court on **May 15, 2022** (the “Existing Judgment”).  

---

**II. EXISTING CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT**

5. Under the Existing Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody of Sophia Miller, with the Plaintiff as the primary residential parent.  
6. The Defendant presently has substantial weekend parenting time, including overnight visits on Sundays.  
7. Both parties were ordered to cooperate on educational decisions and to keep one another informed with respect to Sophia’s schooling and academic progress.

---

**III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the Existing Judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances**, specifically regarding the child’s school attendance and academic performance.  
9. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly failed to return Sophia to school on Mondays after his weekend parenting time, claiming that she “needs a mental health day.”  
10. These absences are unexcused and unsupported by any medical or psychological documentation.  
11. As a result of these absences, the family has received truancy warnings from the school.  
12. Sophia’s academic performance, including grades and standardized test scores, has suffered significantly, and her teachers have expressed concern about her academic regression.  
13. The Defendant has also failed or refused to bring Sophia to scheduled tutoring sessions that fall during his parenting time.  
14. These actions undermine the child’s stability, academic well-being, and the intent of the joint custody arrangement.  
15. The pattern of behavior demonstrates an inability to cooperate on critical educational decisions, contrary to the requirements of joint legal custody.  

---

**IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

16. A Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting time order where a material change in circumstances has occurred, and modification is in the child’s best interests. **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**.  
17. The Massachusetts appellate courts consistently hold that the “paramount concern” in custody determinations is the **best interests of the child**. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).  
18. A material change sufficient to warrant modification exists when the facts demonstrate that the current arrangement is not serving the child’s welfare. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  
19. Courts may revise legal custody where joint decision-making has broken down to the detriment of the child. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006).  
20. Loss of cooperation between joint legal custodians constitutes a material change in circumstances. *Rolde v. Rolde*, supra, at 404-405.  
21. A parent’s failure to prioritize education and compliance with school attendance requirements is a relevant factor in determining the child’s best interests. *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 226 (1998).  
22. The child’s educational stability and consistent attendance at school are key components of her welfare. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003).  
23. The child’s academic regression and truancy warnings demonstrate that the existing parenting plan no longer serves Sophia’s best interests. *Mansur v. Viera*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 968 (2005).  
24. Modification is necessary to ensure consistent school attendance and effective parental decision-making in the educational sphere.  
25. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31**, the Court may reallocate or vest final decision-making authority in one parent where joint custody has become impracticable.  
26. Under *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 638, 643 (2016), when educational disagreements impair the child’s welfare, granting one parent final authority on school issues is appropriate.  
27. Lastly, *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), reaffirms that custody arrangements must evolve when joint custody undermines the child’s educational or emotional stability.

**V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

28. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the Existing Judgment as follows:  
   a. That the Plaintiff, Emma Thompson, be awarded **final decision-making authority regarding the child’s educational matters**, including school attendance and academic support services; or, alternatively,  
   b. That the Defendant’s parenting time be modified to eliminate **Sunday overnights**, ensuring that Sophia wakes up and attends school from the Plaintiff’s residence on Monday mornings.  
29. The requested modification will promote Sophia’s emotional stability, educational progress, and overall well-being, consistent with the child’s best interests.

---

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Emma Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Find that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the Entry of the Existing Judgment on May 15, 2022;  
2. Modify the custody and parenting time order to grant the Plaintiff final decision-making authority regarding educational issues, including school attendance, or in the alternative, to adjust the Defendant’s parenting schedule to eliminate Sunday overnights;  
3. Affirm that this modification is necessary and in the best interests of the minor child, Sophia Miller;  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
