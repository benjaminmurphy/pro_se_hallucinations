v.  

**DANIEL THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of Custody Order pursuant to **G.L. c. 208 § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C § 20**, and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7**, seeking an adjustment of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on **May 15, 2018**, due to a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, **Emily Thompson (age 12)**.

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is: (617) 555‑0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. The Defendant, **Daniel Thompson**, also resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  

3. The parties are the parents of **Emily Thompson (born in 2013)**.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208 § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C § 20**, and **G.L. c. 215 § 6**, as the original custody order was issued by the Norfolk Probate and Family Court and both parties continue to reside in Massachusetts.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court under **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 82**.

---

## **III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

6. On **May 15, 2018**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody Order granting **joint legal custody** and **shared physical custody (50/50)** to the Plaintiff and Defendant on an alternating week schedule.  

7. The existing arrangement functioned successfully for several years while both parents resided nearby and were physically capable of equal caregiving responsibilities.

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the 2018 custody order, a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred affecting the welfare of the child, as defined in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)** and **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.  

9. In or around 2025, the Defendant was diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that significantly impairs physical mobility and balance.  

10. The Defendant’s physician has advised that they should not be responsible for the child in situations requiring rapid physical response or where they may be at risk of a fall (e.g., navigating stairs, emergency situations).  

11. Despite these changes, the Defendant insists on continuing the prior 50/50 schedule without accommodation, and at times relies on the child to assist with physical caregiving tasks such as moving between wheelchair and bed or retrieving medication.  

12. The child, now age twelve, has reported distress and anxiety over these caregiving responsibilities, raising legitimate concerns regarding her safety and emotional wellbeing.  

13. The Plaintiff is fully able to assume primary physical custody and provide a stable, safe, and supportive daily routine while continuing to facilitate frequent and meaningful parenting time between the child and Defendant.  

14. These circumstances constitute a **material change** justifying modification under **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**, **Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015)**, and **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**.

---

## **V. APPLICABLE LAW**

15. Under **G.L. c. 208 § 28**, a custody order “may be modified if the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  

16. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the **best interests of the child** are paramount in all custody determinations. See **Williams v. Pitney, 409 Mass. 449 (1991)**; **Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406 (1976)**; **Bak v. Bak, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987)**.  

17. A parent’s change in health or ability to provide physical care is a recognized basis for modification. See **Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016)**; **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)**.  

18. The Court’s duty to protect a child’s safety and emotional wellbeing requires modification when an existing custodial arrangement places the child at risk. See **Care & Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704 (1984)**; **Adoption of Gregory, 434 Mass. 117 (2001)**.  

19. The Court may fashion an order that both reflects the child’s best interests and affords the non‑custodial parent reasonable parenting time consistent with their abilities. See **Mayo v. Mayo, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 1123 (2011) (Rule 1:28 decision)**; **Kendall v. Kendall, 426 Mass. 238 (1997)**.

---

## **VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

20. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
   a. Modify the prior Judgment of May 15, 2018, to grant **primary physical custody** of the minor child, **Emily Thompson**, to the Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**;  
   b. Maintain **joint legal custody** to the extent feasible, unless the Court determines that sole legal custody is necessary for the child’s best interests;  
   c. Establish a **parenting time schedule** for the Defendant consistent with their health and physical capacity, to promote safety, stability, and continuing contact;  
   d. Order any other relief the Court deems just and proper, including services, counseling, or mediation to facilitate a cooperative co‑parenting relationship.

---

## **VII. CONCLUSION**

21. A fair and thoughtful modification is necessary to protect the physical and emotional welfare of **Emily Thompson**. The changes in Defendant’s health and caregiving capacity satisfy the statutory and common‑law standard for modification under **G.L. c. 208 § 28** and the authorities cited herein.

---

### **WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find a material and substantial change in circumstances;  
2. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of **Emily Thompson**;  
3. Provide appropriate parenting time for the Defendant consistent with their condition; and  
4. Grant such other relief as justice and equity require.
