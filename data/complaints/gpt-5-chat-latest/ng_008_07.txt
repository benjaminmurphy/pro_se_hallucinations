**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about May 15, 2023, at approximately 7:00 p.m., Plaintiff was lawfully on Defendant’s premises as a paying customer for dinner.  
6. While dining, Plaintiff proceeded through a narrow hallway between the restaurant’s kitchen and dining area to use the restroom.  
7. Approximately ten minutes before Plaintiff’s fall, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing multiple water glasses in the same hallway, spilling water and ice onto the tile floor.  
8. The server picked up the broken glass but left the water and ice on the floor, telling others she’d “be right back with a mop.”  
9. No employee placed a warning cone, “wet floor” sign, or otherwise alerted patrons to the presence of the slippery condition, in violation of Defendant’s duty to maintain reasonably safe conditions.  
10. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff walked along that hallway, slipped on the puddle of water and ice, and fell, twisting her right knee.  
11. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain and difficulty bearing weight.  
12. After the fall, Plaintiff overheard Defendant’s employees state that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time prior to the incident.  
13. Plaintiff sought medical treatment at a local urgent care center, where she was diagnosed with a sprained knee requiring a brace and multiple weeks of physical therapy.  
14. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses totaling approximately $3,500.  
15. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to time missed from work as a result of the injury.  
16. As a further result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered pain, discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, and temporary impairment of mobility.

**V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–16 by reference as though fully set forth herein.  
18. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees such as Plaintiff, under Massachusetts common law, including *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
19. Defendant also had a duty to take reasonable steps to inspect, clean, and warn of hazardous conditions, as recognized in *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), and *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).  
20. Defendant breached those duties by failing to:  
   a. Promptly clean the spilled water and ice;  
   b. Post appropriate warning signs or barriers;  
   c. Train and supervise employees to protect patrons from foreseeable hazards; and  
   d. Take other reasonable measures to prevent injury once it knew or should have known of the dangerous condition.  
21. Defendant’s employees affirmatively created the hazardous condition and then left it unattended. Under *Thurlow v. Crossman*, 336 Mass. 248 (1957), a business that creates a dangerous condition on its premises is liable if it fails to correct or warn against it within a reasonable time.  
22. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  
23. Plaintiff’s injuries and losses were the foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, consistent with the standards of *Jasko v. F.W. Woolworth Co.*, 177 Colo. 418, 494 P.2d 839 (1972) (adopted in Massachusetts cases addressing recurring slip hazards).  
24. Plaintiff acted with due care for her own safety and was not comparatively negligent within the meaning of *G.L. c. 231, §85*.  
25. Under Massachusetts law, including *Bateman v. Conway*, 318 Mass. 323 (1945); *Ross v. Broitman*, 338 Mass. 770 (1959); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); *Foster v. The Loft, Inc.*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 289 (1988); *Aylward v. McCloskey*, 412 Mass. 77 (1992); and *Reid v. Parkway Parking, Inc.*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 354 (2010), a property owner is liable for failing to maintain safe premises and warn of dangers it knew or reasonably should have known existed.  
26. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained an injury to her right knee, incurred medical expenses exceeding $3,500, lost approximately $1,200 in wages, and endured pain, suffering, emotional distress, and temporary disability.

**VI. DAMAGES**

27. Plaintiff seeks compensation for all injuries and resulting damages, including:  
   a. Past and future medical expenses;  
   b. Lost wages and diminished earning capacity;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering;  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   e. Any other damages allowed under Massachusetts law.  
28. Plaintiff’s total damages are in excess of $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, satisfying the jurisdictional threshold for this Court.

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Hughes, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Quincy Casual Dining, LLC;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $25,000;  
C. Award prejudgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to *G.L. c. 231, §§6B–6C*;  
D. Award costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as permitted by law; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
