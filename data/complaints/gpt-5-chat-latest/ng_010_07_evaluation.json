Glidden v. Maglio involves a collapsed pump-jack scaffold on a roofing job and addresses causation and notice regarding an allegedly hazardous scaffolding or property condition, not trees or limbs. The court actually emphasizes that plaintiffs produced no evidence that the defendant knew or should have known of any hazardous condition, which cuts against a claim of breach based on known visible defects.",

However, the court explicitly leaves it to the jury to determine whether she actually exercised reasonable care and does not itself conclude that her inaction constituted a failure to exercise reasonable care. Thus, the case supports the existence of a duty, not that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a negligent failure to meet that standard.",

Where recovery has been allowed for emotional distress absent physical harm, the element of reasonable foreseeability usually exists.... We therefore conclude, on the basis of the proceeding analysis, that in order for any of these plaintiffs to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress, she must allege and prove she suffered physical harm as a result of the conduct which caused the emotional distress.\" (386 Mass. at 555\u201357)"
