Ellard is the seminal Massachusetts case abolishing the invitee/licensee distinction and imposing a general duty of reasonable care owed by landowners to all lawful entrants. While this quoted passage is from a concurrence critiquing the treatment of trespassers, it confirms the majority\u2019s shift away from status-based duties toward a unified standard of reasonable care for those lawfully on the premises. Massachusetts courts have read Mounsey as establishing that owners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to conditions under their control; the proposition accurately reflects that holding, though the concurrence also suggests the logic should extend further toward trespassers.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors\u2026 Thus it is awkward to leave the suggestion that the basic reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion may stop short of so called trespassers."

It does not involve or discuss any duty relating to conditions creating risks to users of an adjacent public sidewalk, nor does it extend the landlord\u2019s duty beyond the common areas intended for tenant use. The proposition about risks to persons on a public sidewalk is therefore not addressed or supported by this case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIt is the rule, with some qualifications immaterial to this case, that a landlord is bound to keep the areas intended to be used in common by his tenants in reasonably safe condition for the use contemplated. He is not bound, however, to keep them safe for uses to which they were not meant to be put. \u2026 It does not appear that there would be any danger resulting from their position to one properly using the designated walks.\u201d"

The court concludes there was no duty to protect against the obvious risk of putting a long board through the elevator ceiling and thus no actionable negligent omission that directly and proximately caused the injury. Therefore, the case does not support a proposition that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were directly and proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligent failure to remedy a dangerous condition; it stands for the opposite result.",

The opinion ultimately finds no breach of any such expanded duty and reverses the judgment against the defendant. Using Davis as authority that a defendant\u2019s failure to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition violated the standard of care mischaracterizes the case\u2019s holding, which limits, rather than expands, the duty in these circumstances.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "It is well established that an owner or possessor of land owes a common law duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. \u2026 This duty includes an obligation to maintain the premises in reasonably safe condition and to warn visitors of any unreasonable dangers of which the landowner is aware or reasonably should be aware. \u2026 In this case, Westwood did not fail to exercise reasonable care in the use of its land, nor was there any condition on its land that created an unreasonable risk to users of Route 1A."
