---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith (“Smith”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.  

2. Defendant Michael Johnson (“Johnson”) is an individual who resides at or near the same address, 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, sharing a common driveway with Plaintiff.  

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  

4. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 3(b)** and **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the acts giving rise to this claim occurred in Springfield, within Hampden County.  

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a side-by-side duplex located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, sharing a common driveway.  

6. For several months prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant habitually kept a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against the wooden fence along the boundary of the shared driveway.  

7. The ladder was tall, heavy, and positioned immediately adjacent to the area where Plaintiff routinely parked his vehicle.  

8. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant that the ladder was unstable, particularly on windy days, and could fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle.  

9. Defendant acknowledged those concerns and assured Plaintiff that he would secure the ladder or store it safely; however, Defendant failed to take any corrective action.  

10. On or about March 15, 2023, a windy day, as Plaintiff was backing his vehicle into the driveway, a strong gust of wind knocked over Defendant’s ladder.  

11. The ladder fell with significant force, striking Plaintiff’s vehicle, denting the hood, and cracking the windshield.  

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the ladder, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained substantial damage.  

13. Plaintiff was required to pay for repairs to the vehicle, including a new windshield and bodywork, and also incurred expenses for a rental car while the vehicle was being repaired.  

14. Plaintiff’s total damages include the cost of repairs, deductible, and rental expenses, all resulting from Defendant’s negligence.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under **Massachusetts law**, a person has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the placement and securing of objects on their property so as not to cause foreseeable harm to others. See **Janos v. Morin, 967 N.E.2d 619 (Mass. App. Ct. 2012)**; **Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995)**.  

17. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful neighbor and foreseeable user of the shared driveway, a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent dangerous conditions arising from his property. See **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**; **Sullivan v. Creed, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 650 (2001)**.  

18. Defendant breached this duty by leaving a tall aluminum ladder unsecured and leaning against a fence bordering the shared driveway despite prior warnings and foreseeable risks. See **Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)** (landowner negligent when failing to correct a known danger).  

19. Defendant knew or should have known that high winds could easily dislodge an unsecured ladder, posing a foreseeable risk of property damage or injury. See **Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013)** (foreseeability is key in negligence).  

20. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable precautions was the direct and proximate cause of the damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle. See **Abramian v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 432 Mass. 107 (2000)** (requiring proof of causation between breach and harm).  

21. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage, incurred costs of repair, and suffered inconvenience and loss of use.  

22. Defendant’s negligence constitutes a violation of Massachusetts tort law as articulated in **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302, 303, 364**, as adopted in various forms by Massachusetts courts.  

23. Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial, believed to exceed $25,000.

### IV. DAMAGES

24. Plaintiff suffered the following damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence:

   a. Property damage to his automobile, including a dented hood and cracked windshield;  
   b. Costs of repair and replacement of the windshield;  
   c. Rental car expenses during repairs;  
   d. Deductible payments and incidental costs; and  
   e. Emotional distress and inconvenience associated with the incident and temporary loss of transportation.  

25. Plaintiff’s damages are all reasonably certain and foreseeable within the meaning of **Cimino v. Milford Keg, Inc., 385 Mass. 323 (1982)** and **Griefen v. Boston Water & Sewer Comm’n, 450 Mass. 178 (2007)**.  

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
