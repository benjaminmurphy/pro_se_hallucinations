Docket No. ___________

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson,** and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting schedule originally entered on **May 15, 2016**, in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, regarding the minor child **Sophia Johnson (age 10)**, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s best interests, warranting an updated custodial arrangement pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 208, § 28**, **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 209C, § 20**, and relevant Massachusetts case law.

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify prior custody orders when a material change in circumstances has occurred and a modification would serve the best interests of the child.

5. Venue in Bristol County Probate and Family Court is proper as the existing custody Judgment and Order were issued here, and both parties and the minor child continue to reside within its jurisdiction.

---

### **III. PRIOR ORDER**

6. On **May 15, 2016**, this Court entered a custody order awarding **primary physical custody** to the Defendant, Michael Johnson, with Plaintiff Emily Johnson receiving **limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner**.  

7. The order was based upon circumstances existing at that time, specifically Plaintiff’s graduate school commitments, limited housing, and work schedule, which constrained her ability to provide extended residential care.

---

### **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the 2016 Order, there has been a **substantial and material change** in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and the appropriateness of the existing custodial arrangement.  

9. Plaintiff has completed her graduate education, obtained **stable full-time employment** with a standard schedule, and resides in a **two-bedroom apartment** where Sophia has her own dedicated bedroom.  

10. Plaintiff now possesses the time, financial stability, and resources necessary to assume expanded parenting responsibilities and to provide Sophia with consistent care.  

11. Sophia has developed a **strong emotional bond** with Plaintiff and has expressed a desire for increased time with her mother.  

12. Sophia’s **therapist** has indicated that the child experiences guilt and distress associated with the short duration of visits with her mother and has recommended that an expanded parenting schedule would support her emotional well-being.  

13. Sophia has also expressed her wishes directly in a letter addressed to the Court, stating her desire for more overnight visits with Plaintiff.

14. The Defendant has **refused to discuss any changes** to the existing custody plan and has reacted angrily when Sophia raises the subject, contributing to emotional tension in the family dynamic.

15. The current schedule no longer serves the best interests of the minor child given these changed circumstances and the child’s evolving relationship with both parents.

---

### **V. LEGAL BASIS**

16. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody or parenting time judgment may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where the modification serves the child’s best interests.  

17. The controlling standard, as articulated in *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981), and reaffirmed in *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), requires the Court to ascertain both change in circumstance and the best interests of the child.  

18. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that improvements in a parent’s stability, living arrangements, and ability to meet a child’s needs may constitute a material change warranting modification. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

19. Where the evidence reflects that a prior schedule no longer serves the child’s developmental and emotional needs, the Court may modify custody to ensure continuing promotion of the child’s best interests. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  

20. Courts have also emphasized that the child’s expressed preferences, while not controlling, may inform the best-interest analysis. See *Custody of a Minor (No. 2)*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 91 (1986); *Custody of Zanetti*, 381 Mass. 46 (1980).  

21. In *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), the Supreme Judicial Court reaffirmed that the determination must center on the child’s welfare, not parental convenience or prior assumptions about capacity.  

22. The totality of these authorities makes clear that Plaintiff’s demonstrated stability, Sophia’s emotional needs, and her expressed desires establish both a material change in circumstances and that modification is in the child’s best interests.

### **VI. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and determine that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2016 custody order;

B. Modify the existing order to provide for increased parenting time with Plaintiff, including additional overnights and a schedule consistent with the child’s best interests;

C. Maintain joint legal custody between the parties while adjusting the physical custody schedule to afford greater residential continuity with Plaintiff;

D. Order such other and further relief as justice and the best interests of the child may require.

### **VII. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE**

I, **Emily Johnson**, hereby state that the foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
