---

### I. PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, **Maria Johnson**, is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  
2. The Defendant, **Robert Smith**, is an individual who owns and manages the property located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, where the Plaintiff resides as a tenant.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19**, conferring jurisdiction over civil actions where the damages claimed do not exceed $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Brockton District Court** because the rental premises that are the subject of this action are located in Plymouth County, and the Defendant conducts business in this jurisdiction.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about January 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant to rent the premises located at **123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts**, for a monthly rent of **$1,450**.  
6. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent as agreed and complied with all terms of her tenancy.  
7. On or about **November 10, 2025**, the hot water system in the leased apartment failed, depriving Plaintiff and her infant child of access to hot water necessary for bathing, cooking, and washing.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant that same day of the lack of hot water.  
9. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that a replacement part for the hot water heater was on order and would be installed upon arrival.  
10. Despite these assurances, as of **December 1, 2025**, more than three weeks later, no hot water has been restored.  
11. Plaintiff has had to take cold showers and to boil water for washing dishes.  
12. Plaintiff incurred additional expenses, including a $30 monthly gym membership fee to access hot showers and additional transportation costs to take her baby to her mother’s home for bathing.  
13. Plaintiff has been deprived of the full use and enjoyment of her apartment due to the unavailability of essential hot water for an extended period.  
14. Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain hot water constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, in violation of **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
15. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages and mental distress as a result of the Defendant’s breach.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**  

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §14**, a landlord may not "directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises," and a violation entitles the tenant to actual and statutory damages.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every Massachusetts tenancy.  
    - **See Winchester v. O'Brien**, 266 Mass. 33 (1929);  
    - **Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.**, 340 Mass. 124 (1959).  
19. Interference with essential services such as heat or hot water constitutes a breach of the covenant.  
    - **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord responsible where conduct of others caused substantial interference with tenants' quiet enjoyment);  
    - **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (failure to correct water and heat problems violated G.L. c. 186, §14).  
20. The absence of hot water for an extended period, regardless of the landlord’s intent or efforts, constitutes a “substantial interference” with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises.  
    - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (holding that a landlord’s duty to maintain premises is non-delegable and breach of habitability can also breach quiet enjoyment);  
    - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
21. Massachusetts law holds that the implied warranty of habitability, **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, and the covenant of quiet enjoyment are distinct, but both protect tenants from loss of basic services.  
    - **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
22. The provision of hot water is a basic service required under **105 CMR 410.190** of the State Sanitary Code; its absence conclusively establishes a breach of quiet enjoyment.  
    - **Hemingway v. Commonwealth**, 353 Mass. 756 (1968) (landlord’s failure to comply with sanitary code constitutes breach of habitability and quiet enjoyment).  
23. The Defendant’s failure to restore hot water for more than three weeks constitutes a direct and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the premises, in violation of **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
24. Pursuant to that statute, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent or actual damages**, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
25. Although Plaintiff presently proceeds *pro se*, she seeks recovery of $500 in actual damages, or such greater statutory amount as allowed by law, and any appropriate equitable relief.

### V. DAMAGES  

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions:  
   a. Plaintiff suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her apartment;  
   b. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses including $30 in gym fees and travel costs;  
   c. Plaintiff experienced inconvenience, distress, and disruption of normal family life, particularly in caring for her infant child; and  
   d. Plaintiff has sustained monetary damages estimated at **$500** as of the date of filing, with total statutory damages potentially exceeding that sum pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
2. Award Plaintiff either three months’ rent ($4,350) or her actual damages of $500, whichever is greater, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
3. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, as permitted by statute;  
4. Order Defendant to promptly restore and maintain essential services, including hot water; and  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
