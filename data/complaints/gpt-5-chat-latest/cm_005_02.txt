**Jessica Thompson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  

**Kyle Miller,**  
Defendant.  

Docket No. ___________

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and Related Authorities)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, and respectfully brings this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order entered by this Honorable Court on **May 15, 2022**, and states as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children **Emma Thompson (DOB: [redacted], age 10)** and **Noah Thompson (DOB: [redacted], age 8)**. Her contact information is telephone number **(617) 555‑0123** and email **psm1443@gmail.com**.

2. The Defendant, **Kyle Miller**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the aforementioned minor children.

3. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 215, § 6** and **Probate and Family Court Standing Order 1‑10**, as both parents and the children reside within Bristol County.

---

### **II. PRIOR ORDER**

4. On or about **May 15, 2022**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Plan** providing for **joint legal custody**, with the children’s **primary residence with the Plaintiff**, and **parenting time with the Defendant every other weekend**.

5. The existing order also requires both parties to foster the children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparagement of the other parent in the presence of the children.

---

### **III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. Since entry of the May 15, 2022 order, there has been a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties and the minor children that adversely affects their well‑being. Such a change warrants modification pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**.

7. Over the past year, the Defendant has **unilaterally enrolled the children in extracurricular activities during the Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting weekends** without prior consultation or agreement, contrary to the spirit and terms of joint legal custody as outlined in **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.

8. The Defendant has told the children that it is the Plaintiff’s fault if they cannot attend those activities while in her care, causing confusion and emotional distress for the children, in violation of the order’s non‑disparagement provisions and the co‑parenting intentions endorsed in **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**.

9. The children have reported that their father has referred to the Plaintiff as “selfish” and said she “does not really love them,” resulting in observed **emotional anxiety and physical symptoms**, including one child experiencing **stomach aches on transition days**. Courts have consistently recognized that **a parent’s disparagement of the other parent before the children constitutes a material change in circumstances**. See **Murphy v. Murphy, 380 Mass. 454 (1980)**; **Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 404 (1976)**.

10. Continued exposure to such communication **undermines the children’s relationship with the Plaintiff**, contrary to their best interests as articulated in **G.L. c. 208, § 31** and cases such as **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)** and **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**.

11. The Defendant’s unilateral decisions regarding scheduling and his coercive communications with the children have **eroded the cooperative foundation necessary for joint legal custody**, a basis recognized as essential in **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)** and **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.

12. The Plaintiff has continued to honor the parenting plan, encourage the children’s relationship with their father, and make reasonable requests to swap weekends when necessary for the children’s needs.

13. Because of the Defendant’s actions, co‑parenting communication has deteriorated to a level inconsistent with the “shared decision-making” contemplated by **joint legal custody**. See **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)** (joint custody appropriate only where parents demonstrate mutual respect and ability to cooperate).

---

### **IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN**

14. The **best interests of Emma and Noah** require modification of the custody arrangement so that their home environment remains stable, emotionally secure, and free from disparagement or manipulation, consistent with **Carr v. Carr, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 924 (1998)**.

15. A revised order providing for **sole legal custody or final authority in the Plaintiff over educational and extracurricular scheduling**, and **clarified parenting time provisions**, would serve the children’s best interests under **G.L. c. 208, § 31** and **Custody of Kali, supra**.

---

### **V. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, **Jessica Thompson**, Plaintiff, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2022 order;  
B. **Modify custody** to award **sole legal custody** of the minor children, Emma Thompson and Noah Thompson, to the Plaintiff, or alternatively grant the Plaintiff **final decision‑making authority over extracurricular and educational matters**;  
C. **Clarify and revise the parenting schedule** to ensure both parents have predictable and enforceable time with the children, free from interference or unilateral alterations;  
D. **Reinforce the non‑disparagement and co‑parenting provisions** consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant precedents;  
E. **Order such further relief** as justice and equity may require in the best interests of the minor children.

### **VI. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE**

I, **Jessica Thompson**, hereby verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the statements made in this Complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
