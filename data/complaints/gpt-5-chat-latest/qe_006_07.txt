4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, §8**, because the property at issue is located in this judicial district and the Defendant conducts business here.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **April 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to lease the premises at **123 Elm Street, Brockton, MA**, for residential purposes at a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. Defendant, as landlord, covenanted implicitly and explicitly that Plaintiff would have the **quiet enjoyment** of the premises under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
7. On or about **November 10, 2025**, the **hot water system** in the Plaintiff’s apartment ceased functioning.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water the same day.  
9. Defendant informed Plaintiff that a replacement part had been ordered for the water heater.  
10. Despite multiple assurances from Defendant over the following weeks, the hot water remained unavailable for at least **three weeks** as of December 1, 2025.  
11. During this period, Plaintiff was unable to take hot showers, wash dishes in hot water, or bathe her infant in sanitary conditions within her own apartment.  
12. Plaintiff was forced to purchase a membership at a local gym for **$30 per month** and incur additional transportation expenses to shower elsewhere.  
13. Plaintiff also had to travel to her mother’s residence to bathe her baby, causing significant inconvenience, stress, and loss of comfort and use of the premises.  
14. Defendant maintained control over the building’s hot water system and had a duty to restore essential services in a timely manner.  
15. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent in full and has complied with all obligations under the tenancy.  
16. The deprivation of hot water for an extended period rendered the apartment **not reasonably fit for human habitation**, violating Massachusetts tenant protections.  
17. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water for several weeks constitutes a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of her premises under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

18. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–17 above.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, and violation of this right entitles the tenant to **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, plus court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.  
20. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that failure to provide or restore essential services, such as heat or hot water, constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where interference with tenants’ use and enjoyment results from activities under landlord’s control).  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (relief appropriate where landlord’s conduct substantially impaired habitability).  
   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (prolonged loss of utilities and amenities violates G.L. c. 186, §14).  
   - *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 463 Mass. 907 (2012) (reaffirming tenant protections under §14).  
   - *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (breach of habitability duties implicates quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Petrocelli v. Shuman*, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 496 (1993) (failure to repair essential facilities supports liability).  
   - *McKenna v. Begin*, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977) (landlord’s acts or omissions causing interference violate §14).  
   - *Lowell Hous. Auth. v. Melendez*, 449 Mass. 34 (2007) (emphasizing remedial purpose of tenant-protection statutes).  
   - *Townsend v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 436 Mass. 664 (2002) (interpreting §14 liberally in favor of tenants).  
   - *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (lack of heat and hot water is substantial interference).  
21. Defendant’s prolonged failure to restore hot water, despite repeated notice and opportunity to do so, resulted in physical discomfort, inconvenience, and expense.  
22. This deprivation was sufficiently serious to constitute a **substantial interference** with the Plaintiff’s tenancy and enjoyment of her home under Massachusetts law.  
23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use, emotional distress, and diminished rental value, estimated at **$450**, and seeks statutory relief under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Martinez**, respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award:

1. **Three months’ rent ($3,600)** or **actual damages of $450**, whichever is greater, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
2. **Court costs** and statutory **interest**;  
3. **Reasonable attorney’s fees**, as authorized by **G.L. c. 186, §14** (even if self-represented, to preserve right to fees if counsel later appears);  
4. Any other relief that this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
