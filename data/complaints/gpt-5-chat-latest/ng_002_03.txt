### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff was jogging in a public park near 30 Cole Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts.  
7. The City of Newton prominently posts signs in the park stating that all dogs must be kept **on a leash** at all times, in accordance with **Newton Revised Ordinances, Ch. 3, §21**, and relevant Massachusetts law permitting municipalities to regulate animals (**G.L. c. 140, §§173–174B**).  
8. On that afternoon, Defendant was present in the park with his large dog.  
9. Defendant’s dog was **not leashed**, although Defendant held the dog’s leash over his shoulder while conversing with friends approximately thirty feet away.  
10. As Plaintiff jogged past, Defendant’s dog suddenly **charged toward Plaintiff**, barking loudly.  
11. Fearing that the dog was about to bite her, Plaintiff instinctively swerved off the paved path to avoid the animal.  
12. Plaintiff then tripped over a tree root, lost her footing, and fell down a small embankment.  
13. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a **fractured wrist** and related injuries.  
14. The dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff; however, Defendant’s failure to restrain his dog was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injury.  
15. Several other park users witnessed the incident and can corroborate that Defendant’s dog was unleashed and that his actions caused Plaintiff’s fall and injury.  
16. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses for emergency room treatment, diagnostic imaging, and follow-up care.  
17. Plaintiff also lost approximately **$1,200** in wages due to her inability to work during her recovery period.  
18. Plaintiff additionally suffered pain, emotional distress, and the inability to participate in recreational and musical activities.

### III. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Under Massachusetts law, a person who owns or controls a dog has a **duty to exercise reasonable care** to control the animal and prevent foreseeable injury to others. See **Maillet v. Mininno**, 266 Mass. 86, 88 (1929); **Mahan v. Reynolds**, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 239 (2005).  
21. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to comply with municipal leash ordinances and to maintain control of his dog to prevent harm. **See G.L. c. 140, §§173–174E;** **Salvati v. Franklin**, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 428, 433 (2017) (duty of reasonable care applies to dog owners).**  
22. Defendant breached that duty by allowing his dog to roam unleashed in a public park in violation of the Newton leash law.  
23. Violation of a safety ordinance constitutes **evidence of negligence** under Massachusetts law. **See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 359 (1990); Adamian v. Three Sons, Inc., 353 Mass. 498, 500 (1968).**  
24. Defendant’s negligent conduct was the **proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injuries. But for Defendant’s failure to leash and control his dog, Plaintiff would not have been startled, swerved from the path, or fallen. **See Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., 399 Mass. 790, 794 (1987)** (causation established when harm is foreseeable consequence of negligent act).  
25. The harm suffered by Plaintiff—physical injury, medical expenses, and lost wages—was a **foreseeable risk** of Defendant’s negligent conduct. **See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–48 (2006)** (foreseeability of harm central to duty and causation).  
26. Plaintiff’s injuries were not the result of any negligence on her part, but solely of Defendant’s failure to act as a reasonable person would under similar circumstances. **See Glannon v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 387 Mass. 319, 323 (1982).**  
27. Defendant’s negligence caused Plaintiff to sustain physical pain, emotional distress, economic losses, and diminished enjoyment of life. **See Ulwick v. DeChristopher, 411 Mass. 401 (1991)** (damages recoverable for personal injuries proximately caused by negligence).

### IV. DAMAGES

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer:  
   a. **Medical expenses:** approximately $2,500.  
   b. **Lost wages:** approximately $1,200.  
   c. **Physical pain and suffering**, emotional distress, and inconvenience.  
   d. **Loss of enjoyment of life**, including inability to perform normal recreational and musical activities during recovery.
