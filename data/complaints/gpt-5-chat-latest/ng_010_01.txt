### **JOHN THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.  

---

## **COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **Emily Carter** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is (617) 555‑0123 and email address is *psm1443@gmail.com*.

2. Defendant, **John Thompson** (“Defendant”), is an individual who owns and resides at **123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201**, which is the property where the incident described herein occurred.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, § 4**, which grants jurisdiction to the Superior Court over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.

4. Venue is proper in **Berkshire County Superior Court** pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, §§ 1 & 2**, because the negligent acts and injuries alleged herein occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, within Berkshire County, and the Defendant resides there.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned and controlled the premises located at **123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts** (“the Property”), including a large maple tree adjacent to the public sidewalk.

6. For a substantial period prior to **August 12, 2023**, one of the major branches of the maple tree overhanging the sidewalk was visibly cracked, drooping, and in danger of falling.

7. Plaintiff and other neighborhood residents observed the condition of the branch and communicated their concerns to Defendant, advising him to have the tree inspected by an arborist or other qualified professional.

8. Upon information and belief, Defendant acknowledged the risk but stated he would “deal with it in the spring” and took no remedial action to prune, remove, or otherwise make safe the defective branch.

9. On or about **August 12, 2023**, during a routine summer thunderstorm of ordinary intensity, the cracked branch snapped and fell onto the public sidewalk, striking Plaintiff, who was lawfully walking past the Property while carrying groceries.

10. The impact of the falling branch knocked Plaintiff to the ground and caused **a shoulder strain and multiple bruises** to her upper body and back.

11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff required medical evaluation and treatment, incurring approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses.

12. Plaintiff was further forced to miss approximately one week of work at her retail job, sustaining **lost wages of approximately $650**.

13. Plaintiff continues to suffer pain, discomfort, and emotional distress as a result of the incident.

### **IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. At all relevant times, Defendant owed duties to Plaintiff and to members of the general public lawfully using the public sidewalk adjacent to the Property to maintain the trees and structures thereon in a reasonably safe condition. **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85** provides that every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable injury to others.

16. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner’s duty to exercise reasonable care extends to conditions on the property that pose a recognizable risk of harm to lawful users of adjacent public ways.  
   See *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 416 Mass. 825 (1994); *Schlemmer v. Lowell*, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 297 (1992).

17. Defendant breached this duty by failing to inspect, maintain, and remedy the hazardous condition of the cracked tree branch after receiving notice of its dangerous state.  
   See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) (landowner liable for failing to correct known hazards); *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) (foreseeable defects impose duty of reasonable care).

18. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that a large cracked branch hanging over a public sidewalk created an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to passersby.  
   See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (foreseeability of harm central to negligence duty).

19. The weather conditions on August 12, 2023, were typical for a Massachusetts summer storm and not so extraordinary as to constitute a superseding cause relieving Defendant of liability.  
   See *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp.*, 454 Mass. 37 (2009); *Kirby v. Boylston St. Corp.*, 344 Mass. 110 (1962).

20. Defendant’s failure to act despite actual notice of the defective tree limb was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.  
   See *Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.*, 248 N.Y. 339 (1928) (Cardozo, C.J., principle adopted in Massachusetts regarding foreseeability); *Irwin v. Ware*, 392 Mass. 745 (1984) (proximate cause in negligence).

21. Plaintiff’s injuries, including her shoulder strain, bruises, medical costs, and lost wages, were the reasonably foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain his property in a safe condition.

22. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action.

### **V. DAMAGES**

23. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:
   - Medical expenses of approximately **$1,200**;  
   - Lost wages of approximately **$650**;  
   - Pain, suffering, and emotional distress;  
   - Loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   - Such other general and special damages as will be proven at trial.

24. Pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 6B**, Plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest on any judgment rendered.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **John Thompson**;
