### COMPLAINT

**Plaintiff, Ryan Thompson (“Plaintiff”),** brings this Complaint against **Discount Home Goods, Inc. (“Defendant”)**, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff Ryan Thompson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. He may be reached for correspondence at (617) 555‑0123 or by email at psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. (“Discount Home Goods”) is a Massachusetts corporation doing business in Middlesex County, with a retail store located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  

3. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, §2**, because the events giving rise to this claim occurred within Middlesex County, and Defendant transacts business therein.  

4. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, §4**, because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 exclusive of interest and costs.  

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff lawfully entered Defendant’s Lowell retail store as an invitee to shop for kitchen items.  

6. Defendant maintained merchandise on tall shelving units, stacking boxes of heavy appliances, including toaster ovens, five or six boxes high.  

7. The boxes were unsecured—lacking straps, barriers, or other safety restraints—to prevent them from falling when shelves were nudged or jostled.  

8. Another customer, while pushing a cart in the aisle, made contact with a lower shelf, causing one or more boxes near the top—specifically a boxed toaster oven—to dislodge and fall from a height.  

9. The falling box struck Plaintiff on the **left shoulder and the side of his head**, causing immediate pain, dizziness, and headache.  

10. Defendant’s store manager arrived at the scene, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon but did not summon medical assistance.  

11. Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened later that evening; he sought emergency medical treatment at a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with a **mild concussion** and **shoulder strain**.  

12. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,500 in medical expenses** and lost approximately **$800 in wages** due to time missed from his delivery‑driver employment.  

13. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to participate in his weekly soccer league for about one month.  

14. The incident was caused by Defendant’s failure to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for customers lawfully present.  

15. Defendant knew or should have known that stacking heavy merchandise without safety restraints created an unreasonable risk of harm to patrons.  

---

### III. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth here.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to maintain the premises in a condition reasonably safe for lawful visitors. **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**.  

18. Defendant owed such a duty to Plaintiff, a lawful customer and business invitee.  

19. Defendant breached this duty by:  
   a. Failing to securely stack or restrain heavy merchandise;  
   b. Failing to inspect shelving systems to ensure stability;  
   c. Failing to warn patrons of the risk of falling merchandise; and  
   d. Failing to adopt and enforce reasonable safety policies regarding display of heavy boxed goods.  

20. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages. **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996)**; **Banaghan v. Dewey, 340 Mass. 73 (1959)**.  

21. Defendant’s employees and agents acted within the scope of their employment at all relevant times, imposing vicarious liability on Defendant under the doctrine of **respondeat superior**, see **Krasnecky v. Meffen, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 418 (2002)**.  

22. The foreseeability of harm from improperly stacked merchandise is well‑established under Massachusetts premises‑liability principles. **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007)**.  

23. A reasonably prudent store operator would have foreseen the likelihood that customers or carts would contact shelving units and cause unsecured boxes to fall. **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**.  

24. Defendant’s negligence constitutes a failure to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances, **Toubiana v. Priestly, 402 Mass. 84 (1988)**; **Decker v. Black & Decker Mfg. Co., 389 Mass. 35 (1983)**.  

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and suffered physical and emotional pain and suffering.  

26. Comparative fault does not bar recovery under **G.L. c. 231, §85**, as Plaintiff did not act negligently or unreasonably in the store.  

27. Massachusetts law permits recovery for all reasonably foreseeable consequences of tortious conduct, **Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540 (1982)**, including medical bills, lost wages, and general damages for pain and suffering.  

28. Plaintiff therefore seeks judgment against Defendant for all damages recoverable under Massachusetts law.  

---

### IV. DAMAGES AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc., and grant the following relief:

A. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to exceed **$50,000**, including:  
   1. Medical expenses, approximately **$1,500**;  
   2. Lost wages, approximately **$800**;  
   3. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;  
   4. All other damages allowed by law.  

B. Costs of suit pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**.  

C. Interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, §6B**.  

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

### V. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**.
