# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Laura Jenkins**, residing in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2019**, in the above-captioned case concerning the minor child **Emily Jenkins**, age 8.  

Plaintiff seeks modification pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and applicable Massachusetts case law on the basis of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that affects the welfare and best interests of the minor child.

---

### II. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Laura Jenkins, primary custodial parent of minor child, Emily Jenkins.  
   Address: [Plaintiff’s current address in Barnstable County]  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Mark Jenkins, noncustodial parent and party to the existing custody order.  
   Address: [Defendant’s current address in Cape Cod, Massachusetts].

3. **Minor Child:** Emily Jenkins, born [Insert DOB] (age 8).

---

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** (for divorce and custody modifications) and **G.L. c. 215, §§ 6 & 39** to modify prior judgments concerning custody and visitation when it is shown that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the earlier judgment.

5. Venue is proper in the **Barnstable Probate and Family Court**, as both parents and the minor child have significant connections to Barnstable County.

---

### IV. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

6. On **May 15, 2019**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** awarding the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, primary physical custody of the parties’ minor child, and awarding the Defendant, Mark Jenkins, parenting time **every other weekend** and **one midweek overnight on Wednesdays**.

7. At the time of the 2019 Order, both parties resided in the same town, and the midweek overnight involved only a brief five‑minute drive to school on Thursday mornings.

8. In 2024, the Defendant relocated approximately **ninety (90) miles away to Cape Cod**, while continuing to insist upon exercising the same midweek Wednesday overnight schedule.

---

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since the relocation, the Defendant’s insistence on maintaining the midweek overnight has resulted in **significant hardship and disruption** to the minor child’s routine.

10. The Defendant now picks up Emily from school on Wednesdays, drives her almost three hours round‑trip to Cape Cod, and then wakes her as early as **4:30 a.m.** on Thursday mornings to return her to school.

11. As a result of this exhausting travel, Emily has exhibited **chronic fatigue**, **declining academic participation**—as confirmed by her teacher—and increased irritability on Thursdays.

12. The child’s current schedule **no longer serves her best interests** and undermines her educational and emotional well-being.

13. Massachusetts law requires that custody and parenting time orders remain **flexible to protect the child’s welfare** when circumstances materially change. See **G.L. c. 208, § 28**; **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).

---

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a judgment regarding custody “if the Court finds that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** of the parties has occurred and that modification is **necessary in the best interests of the child**.”

15. A material change is demonstrated when the circumstances underlying the prior judgment have significantly altered. See **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

16. Relocation that substantially affects the child’s schooling, rest, or development constitutes a sufficient material change. See **Williams v. Pitney**, 409 Mass. 449 (1991); **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

17. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody determinations. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

18. Stability and predictability in a child’s school week are critical to their welfare. See **Custody of Zia**, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000); **Custody of Michel**, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 260 (1990).

19. Where a prior parenting plan undermines the child’s health or education due to changed geography or parental relocation, modification is warranted. See **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); **Mazzone v. Mazzone**, 429 Mass. 152 (1999).

20. Here, the Defendant’s relocation and the resulting midweek travel impose concrete, detrimental effects on Emily’s sleep, school, and overall well-being—constituting a **material and substantial change in circumstances** requiring this Court’s intervention.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Laura Jenkins**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Eliminate the midweek Wednesday overnight** from the existing custody and parenting schedule due to the material change in the parties’ circumstances and its adverse impact on the minor child;  

2. **Adjust the weekend parenting schedule** as the Court deems just and proper, to ensure meaningful and consistent parenting time for the Defendant without disrupting the child’s academic or physical wellbeing;  

3. Confirm that Plaintiff Laura Jenkins shall retain **primary physical custody** and co-parental legal custody;  

4. Award such further relief as this Court deems fair, just, and in the **best interests of the child**.
