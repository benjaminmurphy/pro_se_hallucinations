### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On **September 9, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and invitee at Defendant’s FreshMart Grocery Store located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  
6. While shopping in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff encountered a puddle of spilled milk on the floor.  
7. The puddle was plainly visible, and shopping cart tracks indicated that customers had been traversing through it for some time.  
8. There were no warning signs, cones, or other notices alerting customers to the presence of the spill.  
9. An employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away from the puddle.  
10. After Plaintiff slipped and fell, the employee admitted he had seen the spill “a few minutes ago” but had not yet cleaned it up or placed a warning sign because he was finishing his other tasks.  
11. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff struck the floor and suffered a **hip sprain**.  
12. Plaintiff initially believed she was uninjured, but that evening developed significant pain.  
13. Plaintiff sought medical treatment the next day at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain and prescribed physical therapy.  
14. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses and **$1,500** in lost wages due to missed work at her café job.  
15. Plaintiff continues to experience residual discomfort and limited mobility as a consequence of the injury.  
16. Defendant, by and through its employees and agents, had notice of the dangerous condition and failed to take timely actions to remedy it or provide adequate warning.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE  

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  

18. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or remedy hazards of which it knew or should have known. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

19. Defendant, by failing to clean up the spill or post a warning sign despite actual knowledge of the hazardous condition, breached that duty of reasonable care. *See* **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  

20. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner is liable for injuries to lawful visitors resulting from conditions that the owner knew or reasonably should have known posed an unreasonable risk. *See* **DePonte v. Devon Shores Condo. Trust**, 483 Mass. 174 (2019); **Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.**, 400 Mass. 837 (1987).  

21. Defendant further breached its duty under *Restatement (Second) of Torts* §343, as adopted in Massachusetts, by failing to (a) discover the condition, (b) realize it involved an unreasonable risk, and (c) protect customers like Plaintiff.  

22. The employee’s admission that he was aware of the spill constitutes actual notice to Defendant. *See* **Gallant v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.**, 343 Mass. 88 (1961).  

23. Defendant’s failure to act within a reasonable period after notice of the spill constitutes actionable negligence. *See* **Foley v. Matulewicz**, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 1004 (1984).  

24. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006).  

25. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain, suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982) (recognizing recovery of emotional and physical injury damages).  

26. Plaintiff’s damages were not caused in any part by her own comparative fault, but if comparative negligence is alleged, any such percentage should be modest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85.  

27. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care recognized under Massachusetts tort law and constitutes negligence entitling Plaintiff to judicial relief. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).

### V. DAMAGES

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred the following damages:  
   a. Past and future medical expenses, approximately **$1,200** to date;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of **$1,500**;  
   c. Pain and suffering, physical impairment, and diminished enjoyment of life;  
   d. Such other losses as may be proven at trial.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **FreshMart Grocery Store**, and:

A. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including medical expenses, lost earnings, and pain and suffering;  
B. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
C. Award costs and reasonable expenses; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
