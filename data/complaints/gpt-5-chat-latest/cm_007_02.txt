### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY JUDGMENT  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, respectfully files this Complaint for Modification pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28 and c. 209C, § 20, seeking modification of the custody provisions contained in the existing Judgment of Divorce/Parenting Order entered on **May 14, 2019** by the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court.

2. The existing Judgment provides for **shared physical custody (50/50), alternating weekly**, between Plaintiff and Defendant regarding their minor child, **Samantha Collins**, born [date omitted for privacy, age 12].

3. Substantial and material changes in circumstances have occurred since the 2019 Judgment, affecting the best interests and welfare of the child, necessitating modification of the existing custody order.

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

7. Jurisdiction is proper under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** (modification of custody and support) and **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as this Court issued the original custody judgment and both parties reside within the Commonwealth.

8. Venue is proper in **Middlesex County Probate and Family Court**, where the original judgment was entered and where the child resides primarily within Middlesex County for school and care.

---

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

9. At the time of the original order, both parties were in good health and resided within close proximity, facilitating shared physical custody.

10. The parties successfully maintained an alternating weekly schedule from May 2019 forward, providing stability and consistent routines for Samantha.

11. In or around mid‑2025, Defendant **Michael Collins** was diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that substantially impairs his mobility and capacity to provide independent physical care for the child.

12. Defendant’s treating physician has reportedly advised that Defendant **should not be alone with the child in situations involving stairs, transfer from a wheelchair, or other tasks requiring quick physical response.**

13. Despite this, Defendant has continued insisting on maintaining the exact 50/50 schedule. This has resulted in instances where **Samantha has been required to assist Defendant with mobility**, including transfers from a wheelchair and fetching household items, placing inappropriate physical and emotional responsibility upon the child.

14. The above circumstances represent a **substantial and material change** in the condition of a parent since entry of the existing order.

15. The current custodial arrangement places **Samantha’s safety and emotional well‑being** at risk and no longer reflects her best interests, as defined under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31** and **Yannas v. Frondistou–Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**.

16. The Plaintiff can provide a stable, safe, and nurturing home environment, ensuring Samantha’s physical and emotional needs are met while supporting continued and meaningful contact with Defendant within parameters consistent with his current abilities.

**V. LAW AND ARGUMENT**

17. The standard for modification of custody orders in Massachusetts requires a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the prior judgment and that the modification is in the **best interests of the child.** (*See* **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981)*.)

18. Massachusetts law provides that the **paramount concern of the court is the welfare and best interests of the child.** (*Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)*.)

19. Where a parent’s medical condition or physical incapacity materially affects the child’s safety, modification of custodial arrangements may be appropriate. (*See* *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)*.)

20. The Court has consistently held that **changes affecting a parent's ability to provide day‑to‑day physical care** constitute material changes warranting modification when such change impacts a child’s environment and stability. (*See* *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); *White v. LaBarge*, 490 Mass. 911 (2022)*.)

21. Plaintiff requests that legal custody remain joint, but that **primary physical custody** be modified in favor of the Plaintiff, with liberal parenting time for Defendant adapted to his current medical limitations, and with conditions ensuring Samantha’s safety.

22. The modification sought accords with the statutory and case‑law framework, including:  
   - **M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31** (modification and custody standards)  
   - **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6** (equity jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court)  
   - *Bouchie v. Murray*, 376 Mass. 524 (1978) (best interests paramount).  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (child’s welfare governs custody decisions).  
   - *Macri v. Macri*, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 362 (2019) (health and home stability can warrant modification).

23. In light of these authorities and facts, the Court should find that continued shared physical custody **no longer serves the best interests of Samantha** and that modification of custody is both legally and factually warranted.

**VI. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff **Jessica Collins** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 14, 2019 custody order;  
B. **Modify** the existing custody judgment to award **primary physical custody** of the minor child, **Samantha Collins**, to the Plaintiff;  
C. **Order** that legal custody remain joint to the extent practical in the child’s best interests;  
D. **Establish a parenting schedule** providing Defendant significant and meaningful parenting time consistent with his medical abilities and the child’s safety;  
E. **Grant such further relief** as equity and justice may require.
