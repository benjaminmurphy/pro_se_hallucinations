### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **January 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the apartment located at **123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA**, with agreed monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
7. Defendant is the owner and landlord of said premises and is responsible for maintaining essential services, including adequate hot water.  
8. On or about **November 10, 2025**, the hot water system in Plaintiff’s apartment failed.  
9. Plaintiff **immediately notified Defendant** of the lack of hot water. Defendant stated that the water heater required a replacement part and that such part had been ordered.  
10. As of **December 1, 2025**, the hot water has not been restored. The premises have lacked hot water for approximately **three weeks**.  
11. During that period, Plaintiff has been forced to bathe and clean using cold water, boil water manually for dishes, and incur additional costs of approximately **$30 per month** for gym access and associated travel expenses to shower.  
12. Plaintiff has also had to travel with her infant child to her mother’s residence to bathe her baby safely, causing additional hardship and inconvenience.  
13. Defendant has acknowledged the problem and has communicated with Plaintiff but has not restored hot water within a reasonable period.  
14. Defendant’s continued failure to provide adequate hot water constitutes a violation of the **Massachusetts State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. 410.190**, which requires that landlords provide and maintain operable facilities for safe hot water.  
15. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord is prohibited from directly or indirectly interfering with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of her dwelling by action or omission.  
18. Defendant’s failure to maintain essential hot water service constitutes an **interference** with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment and violates her statutory right to quiet enjoyment.  
19. Under Massachusetts law, interference with essential services such as heat or hot water constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, even absent malicious intent. See, e.g.:  
   - **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for interference resulting from his omissions).  
   - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (covenant of quiet enjoyment broad enough to cover substantial interference even without intent).  
   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (constructive interference violates covenant).  
   - **Winthrop v. O’Brien**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 514 (1988) (failure to maintain adequate essential services can constitute breach).  
   - **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment protects tenant against substantial interference by landlord’s acts or omissions).  
   - **Doe v. Springfield Hous. Auth.**, 428 Mass. 906 (1999) (omission sufficient if interference foreseeable).  
   - **Cox v. Ruef**, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1985) (landlord liable under §14 for failure to correct defective conditions).  
   - **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (loss of heat constitutes violation of covenant).  
   - **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord’s inaction can amount to breach of statutory duty).  
   - **M.G.L. c. 239, §8A** (tenant may assert breach of quiet enjoyment as defense or counterclaim for rent abatement).  
20. The deprivation of hot water for an extended period constitutes a condition which “seriously interferes with the health or safety” of the occupants as defined by **105 C.M.R. 410.750** and constitutes interference within the meaning of **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
21. As a result of Defendant’s violation, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment of the premises, out-of-pocket costs, inconvenience, and distress.  
22. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, or **three months’ rent**, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  
23. Plaintiff seeks actual damages of approximately **$450** to compensate for lost enjoyment, out-of-pocket expenses, and inconvenience.
