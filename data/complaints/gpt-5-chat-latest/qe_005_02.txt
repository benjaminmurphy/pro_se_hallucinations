____________________________________  

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 567 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.  

2. Defendant **Robert Williams** (“Defendant”) is an individual or landlord doing business in Massachusetts and the owner and lessor of the property located at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19 and G.L. c. 185C, §3 because the subject premises are located in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.  

4. This action arises under the laws and statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing landlord-tenant relationships and implied covenants in residential leases.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the second-floor apartment at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts for a monthly rental amount of $1,800.  

6. The lease includes an express covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing Plaintiff peaceful and undisturbed possession of the premises, consistent with the covenants implied in all residential leases under Massachusetts law.  

7. Around June 2025, new tenants moved into the third-floor apartment above Plaintiff’s unit.  

8. Since their move-in, these upstairs tenants have repeatedly made excessive noise, including heavy footsteps, loud music played late at night, and the frequent movement of furniture during nighttime hours.  

9. Plaintiff made several direct requests to the upstairs tenants to reduce their noise, which were temporarily effective for approximately one week before the disturbances resumed.  

10. Plaintiff made at least five or six complaints to Defendant about the ongoing noise, beginning around July 2025 and continuing through November 2025.  

11. Defendant addressed the tenants once, but then stated to Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”  

12. Despite Defendant’s awareness of these conditions and his control over the building as the common landlord for all tenants, he failed to take further reasonable steps to abate the noise or otherwise restore Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment of the premises.  

13. As a result of the persistent disturbance, Plaintiff has been deprived of quiet and comfortable enjoyment of her apartment, averaging only four to five hours of sleep per night.  

14. Plaintiff has suffered physical and emotional distress, including exhaustion and insomnia, as confirmed by her physician, resulting in the need for sleep medication costing approximately $40 per month.  

15. Plaintiff also received a written warning at her job for falling asleep at her desk due to sleep deprivation.  

16. Plaintiff has further incurred expenses attempting to mitigate the harm, including the purchase of earplugs and a white noise machine, all to no avail.  

17. The Defendant’s failure to remedy or control this disturbance constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, in violation of Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

18. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. A violation occurs when the landlord’s actions or inactions substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of the leased property.  

20. Defendant, by failing to take reasonable measures to abate ongoing noise disturbances caused by other tenants in the same building he controls, has breached this covenant.  

21. Defendant’s inaction constitutes an indirect interference proscribed by **G.L. c. 186, §14**, as recognized in **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), where the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s failure to control excessive noise from adjacent tenants within the landlord’s control constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

22. Similarly, in **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), the Court affirmed that a landlord’s unreasonable failure to remedy intolerable disturbances from other tenants constituted an actionable breach of quiet enjoyment.  

23. See also **Winchester v. Stevens**, 228 Mass. 426 (1917) (recognizing landlord liability for interference resulting from conditions within his control); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (tenant may recover damages under G.L. c. 186, §14 for interference with beneficial use of the premises); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord strictly liable for violation of §14 regardless of intent).  

24. Defendant’s conduct also violates the rule articulated in **Foster v. 1000 Realty Corp.**, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 763 (2001), confirming that excessive noise originating within a landlord’s property, where remedial power rests with the landlord, can form the basis of a quiet enjoyment claim.  

25. In **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005), the court reaffirmed that a landlord’s failure to correct disturbances caused by other tenants can result in liability under §14.  

26. Numerous decisions—**Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); and **Young v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 398 Mass. 631 (1986)—reinforce tenants’ statutory and contractual right to peaceful possession, free from unreasonable interference.  

27. The Defendant knew or should have known that the excessive noise emanating from the apartment above Plaintiff’s unit was depriving her of quiet enjoyment of her home, and yet failed to act.  

28. Defendant’s omissions directly caused Plaintiff to lose sleep, suffer stress and inconvenience, incur medical and mitigation expenses, and experience a decline in her health and job performance.  

29. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, including emotional distress and out-of-pocket expenses, and may recover up to three months’ rent as statutory damages.  

30. Plaintiff has suffered damages of at least $2,400, representing both actual losses and statutory damages permitted under law.

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Robert Williams** for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14;  

B. Award Plaintiff compensatory and statutory damages in the amount of **$2,400**, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater;  

C. Award reimbursement for incidental and consequential damages, including costs, medications, and other related expenses;  

D. Award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs under G.L. c. 186, §14; and  

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
