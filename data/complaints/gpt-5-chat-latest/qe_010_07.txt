### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Beginning in or around **September 2025**, mold began to grow in the bathroom of Plaintiff’s apartment, originating in the corner of the shower and spreading across the ceiling.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition.  
9. Defendant inspected the bathroom but claimed the mold resulted from Plaintiff’s “too hot and too long” showers and alleged insufficient use of the exhaust fan.  
10. The bathroom has no window and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation. Plaintiff routinely operated the fan during showers.  
11. Despite Plaintiff’s efforts, the mold continued to proliferate, creating an unsanitary, unsafe, and uninhabitable environment.  
12. The mold caused Plaintiff to experience respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, ailments which her physician attributed to mold exposure.  
13. Plaintiff was required to discard personal property, including a shower curtain and towels, valued at approximately **$60**, due to mold contamination.  
14. Defendant has refused to take reasonable steps to remediate the mold or to correct the underlying ventilation problem, asserting that Plaintiff “caused” the condition.  
15. Defendant’s actions and omissions have interfered with Plaintiff’s right to **quiet enjoyment** of her tenancy and have rendered the premises unfit for human habitation.  
16. The continued presence of mold constitutes a violation of **sanitary code standards** under **105 C.M.R. §410.750**, which requires landlords to maintain premises free from chronic dampness and mold.  
17. Plaintiff has suffered loss of use, deterioration of health, property damage, and emotional distress as a result of Defendant’s conduct.  
18. Plaintiff has incurred and continues to incur damages in an amount of approximately **$150** and seeks all additional damages available by statute.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

19. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment by acts or omissions causing the premises to be uninhabitable or unfit violates the tenant’s statutory rights and is liable for damages.  
21. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord’s failure to correct known defects seriously interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises. *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91 (1982)**.  
22. The statute protects tenants from conditions created or allowed to persist by a landlord that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714 (1977)**.  
23. Failure to maintain a habitable dwelling and violations of the **State Sanitary Code** constitute interference with quiet enjoyment. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847 (1997)**; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, **379 Mass. 196 (1979)**.  
24. Defendant’s failure to remove mold and correct the underlying ventilation defect, despite notice, constitutes a substantial interference with the beneficial use of the premises, and thus a breach. *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, **410 Mass. 855 (1991)**; *Young v. Patukonis*, **24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)**.  
25. Massachusetts courts hold landlords liable when omissions result in unsafe, unsanitary, or unhealthy conditions within rental units. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273 (1994)**; *Lowery v. Robinson*, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**.  
26. The covenant of quiet enjoyment applies regardless of whether the landlord’s interference is intentional or results from negligence. *Winchester v. Seay*, **394 Mass. 581 (1985)**; *Jablonski v. Clemons*, **60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004)**.  
27. The existence of mold, which is inconsistent with the **warranty of habitability** under *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, **363 Mass. 184 (1973)**, also constitutes a violation of quiet enjoyment, as multiple courts recognize that substantial code violations and health hazards are actionable interferences.  
28. Defendant’s deliberate failure to remedy the mold after notice is a “direct or indirect interference” within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
29. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff has suffered physical discomfort, health issues, property loss, and consequential damages.  
30. Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and statutory damages**, including up to **three months’ rent or three times actual damages, whichever is greater**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by **G.L. c. 186, §14**.
