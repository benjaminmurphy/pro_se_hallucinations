v.  

**DAVID THOMPSON**,  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY JUDGMENT**

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin**, and pursuant to *Massachusetts General Laws* c. 208, § 28, c. 209C, § 20, and applicable caselaw, respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered on **April 15, 2022**, in the above-captioned matter.  

In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Martin**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and primary residential parent of the minor child, **Emily Thompson**, age 10. Jessica’s contact information is: (617) 555‑0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. The Defendant, **David Thompson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child.  

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to *G.L. c. 215,* §§ 3 and 6, and *G.L. c. 208,* § 28.  

---

## **II. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR JUDGMENT**

4. On **April 15, 2022**, this Court entered a Judgment providing for **joint legal custody** of minor child **Emily Thompson**, with the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, designated as the **primary residential parent**.  

5. Pursuant to that Judgment, the Defendant, David Thompson, was granted **substantial weekend parenting time**, including **Sunday overnights**, returning Emily to school on Monday mornings.  

6. The Judgment further directs both parents to **cooperate on matters concerning Emily’s education and school attendance** and to communicate regarding all significant issues affecting the child’s welfare.  

---

## **III. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since entry of the original custody Judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the best interests of the minor child, warranting modification under *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and established case law, including *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); and *Prenaveau v. Prenaveau*, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 131 (2009).  

8. Over the past year (2024–2025), the Defendant has repeatedly **kept Emily home from school on Mondays** following his weekend parenting time, citing that she “needs a mental health day.”  

9. These absences have been **unexcused** and **unsupported by medical documentation**, contrary to the parties’ joint legal custody obligations.  

10. As a direct result of these repeated absences, Emily’s **attendance record has triggered truancy warnings** from her school and her **academic performance has materially declined**, as reflected in lower grades and standardized test scores.  

11. The Defendant has also **failed to take Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions** on weekends when those fall within his parenting time, further impacting her educational progress.  

12. The Defendant’s conduct demonstrates a **pattern of disregard for Emily’s educational needs**, which constitutes a substantial change in circumstances since the prior order.  

13. These repeated absences have caused **academic and emotional harm** to the minor child, constituting a serious interference with the Plaintiff’s ability to ensure stability and proper school attendance.  

14. Continued joint legal custody on school-related decisions is **no longer workable or in the child’s best interests** because the Defendant’s actions undermine consistent education and routine.  

15. The Plaintiff’s proposed modification seeks to protect the child’s welfare and educational stability, consistent with the “best interest of the child” standard as articulated in *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), and *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

---

## **IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

16. Under *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and *G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, the Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of a **material and substantial change** and that modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  

17. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized that interference with a child’s schooling or disregard for educational responsibilities constitutes a material change warranting modification. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

18. The Supreme Judicial Court has emphasized that “a parenting plan that undermines a child’s educational welfare cannot be consistent with the child’s best interests.” *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 845; see also *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006) (material changes in parental cooperation justify modification of legal custody).  

19. The Defendant’s failure to return Emily to school consistently on Mondays and to ensure attendance at tutoring sessions constitutes a material deviation from the cooperative joint custody arrangement contemplated in 2022, satisfying the statutory and judicial standards for modification.  

20. The modification sought herein aligns with the child’s best interests by promoting stability, academic progress, and consistent routines, consistent with *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and *Pierce v. Pierce*, 455 Mass. 286 (2009).  

---

## **V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

21. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the Judgment dated April 15, 2022, by entering an order providing that:  

   a. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Martin**, shall have **final decision-making authority regarding Emily’s school attendance and educational matters**, including decisions concerning absences, tutoring, and academic support; **or**, in the alternative,  

   b. The Defendant’s **Sunday overnight parenting time** shall be **suspended or modified** such that Emily returns to the Plaintiff’s care on **Sunday evenings**, ensuring consistent school attendance on Mondays;  

   c. The Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper in the circumstances.  

---

## **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the prior Judgment;  
2. Modify the current custody and parenting order consistent with the best interests of the minor child, as set forth above;  
3. Award the Plaintiff **final authority on educational matters** or adjust parenting time accordingly; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as justice may require.
