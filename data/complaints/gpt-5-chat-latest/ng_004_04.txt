### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (Negligence)

---

**Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”),** by way of Complaint against the Defendant, Anna Brooks (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and, at all relevant times, was lawfully present on the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

2. Defendant, Anna Brooks, is an individual who owns and controls the real property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 1** and **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the events giving rise to this action occurred within Worcester County and the damages exceed $50,000.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

4. On or about **February 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises at 123 Maple Street in Worcester, Massachusetts, for the purpose of delivering groceries to one of the building’s tenants.

5. Defendant owned, maintained, and/or controlled the sidewalk in front of the premises and had a duty to maintain the area in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and invitees.

6. Following a significant snowstorm in **February 2023**, Defendant undertook to shovel a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk.

7. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or other de-icing or traction materials to the walkway after clearing, despite freezing temperatures and visible melting and refreezing conditions in the days following the storm.

8. Over the course of several days, the shoveled path became a hazardous sheet of ice.

9. Tenants of the building notified Defendant via text messages and photographs that the sidewalk was extremely icy and dangerous.

10. Upon receiving these reports, Defendant replied, “the sun will take care of it,” and took no further action to remedy the hazard.

11. On February 15, 2023, while walking along the shoveled path to make a grocery delivery, Plaintiff slipped on the ice, fell backward, and sustained a serious lower back injury.

12. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff required medical evaluation and treatment, incurring approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses and suffering **$1,000** in lost wages due to the inability to work for approximately one week.

13. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

---

### III. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.

15. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk at 123 Maple Street in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors, including delivery persons.

16. Under **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973), landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to avoid foreseeable injuries.

17. Pursuant to **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), Massachusetts landowners owe a duty to remove and treat snow and ice in a reasonable manner and are liable for failing to exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries from accumulations of natural or unnatural snow and ice.

18. Defendant breached her duty of care by failing to properly treat, sand, or salt the sidewalk, despite actual knowledge of the icy condition and notice of its danger.

19. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable safety measures constitutes negligence under **Jardine v. Upper Darby Lodge No. 1973, Inc.**, 413 Mass. 213 (1992) (landowner liability for failure to remedy known hazards), and **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000) (duty to maintain premises in reasonably safe condition).

20. Defendant’s conduct also violated her obligations under **G.L. c. 84, §§ 15–17**, which require reasonable maintenance of ways and sidewalks, and reflects the breach of the common-law duty articulated in **Whittaker v. Saraceno**, 418 Mass. 196 (1994).

21. Defendant had actual notice of the hazardous condition through direct communication from her tenants and failed to act reasonably, as recognized in **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority**, 431 Mass. 376 (2000), and **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

22. Defendant’s failure to act in response to known icy conditions constitutes willful indifference to the safety of others and breaches the standard of reasonable care under **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).

23. Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain and treat the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition.

24. As a result, Plaintiff sustained and will continue to sustain physical injury, pain, medical expenses, lost income, and other consequential damages.

---

### IV. DAMAGES

25. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical treatment expenses and **$1,000** in lost wages.

26. Plaintiff continues to experience lower back pain and loss of enjoyment of normal activities.

27. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and all other available relief under Massachusetts law, including **G.L. c. 231, § 85**.

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury, reasonably believed to exceed $50,000;  
C. Award costs, statutory interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

**Respectfully submitted,**  
This 1st day of December, 2025.
