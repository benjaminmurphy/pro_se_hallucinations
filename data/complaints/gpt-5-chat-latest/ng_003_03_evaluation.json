The court abolishes the natural/unnatural accumulation distinction precisely in order to apply the general reasonable-care duty to hazards from snow and ice, placing such hazards on the same footing as all other premises risks. This directly supports the proposition that a business owner owes a business invitee a duty of reasonable care regarding premises safety and foreseeable risks of harm.",

The court focuses on whether the defendant\u2019s employees knew or should have known of a liquid spill on the floor, not on risks created by unrestrained stacks of heavy boxes in customer aisles.

The proposition about failure to prevent falling merchandise under accepted retail safety practices is therefore unrelated to the issues and holding in this opinion.",
