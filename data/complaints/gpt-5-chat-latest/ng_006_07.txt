**COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
Plaintiff Alex Johnson (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES
1. Plaintiff Alex Johnson is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual residing in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was operating or in control of a motor vehicle within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and the acts complained of occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
4. The causes of action asserted herein arise under Massachusetts common law of negligence and related statutory duties.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
5. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully riding his bicycle to work in a marked bicycle lane near 500 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet and complying with all traffic regulations and signals.  
7. Defendant was parked in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bicycle lane.  
8. Without warning or reasonable care, Defendant suddenly opened the driver-side door of his vehicle into the bike lane, directly in Plaintiff’s path of travel.  
9. Defendant failed to check his mirror or ensure the lane was clear prior to opening the door, in violation of his duty of reasonable care and of G.L. c. 90, § 14, which prohibits opening a vehicle door unless it is reasonably safe to do so.  
10. Plaintiff, with no time to brake or evade, collided with the open door, was thrown from his bicycle onto the pavement, and sustained bodily injuries and property damage.  
11. At the scene, Defendant admitted he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone, demonstrating inattention and negligence per se.  
12. Plaintiff suffered road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth requiring dental treatment, and a bent bicycle frame requiring replacement.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200.00** in medical and dental expenses, **$800.00** in lost wages, and other related out‑of‑pocket expenses.  
14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant’s insurance carrier, but the insurer, based on Defendant’s incorrect statement that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” denied coverage.  
15. Plaintiff’s damages, losses, and injuries were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE
16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, every motorist owes a duty of reasonable care toward all other users of public ways, including bicyclists. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).  
18. Defendant had a statutory and common‑law duty to refrain from opening his vehicle door into moving traffic without first ensuring that such movement could be made in safety. *See* **G.L. c. 90, § 14**; *see also* **Massachusetts Driver’s Manual**, Ch. 4, “Rules of the Road.”  
19. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to (a) look for oncoming bicyclists before opening his door; (b) maintain proper attention while parked; and (c) ensure that his actions would not endanger others. *Cf.* **Gorey v. Guarente**, 303 Mass. 569 (1939) (duty to exercise care when opening automobile door).  
20. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts common law. *See* **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (duty of reasonable care measured by foreseeability of harm); **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (breach of duty established by unreasonable conduct).  
21. Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related safety statutes constitutes evidence of negligence per se. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355 (1990); **Guinan v. Boston Elevated Ry.**, 267 Mass. 526 (1929).  
22. Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence. *See* **Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.**, 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), adopted in part by Massachusetts law as to foreseeability principles.  
23. As a further proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, pain and suffering, lost wages, medical expenses, and property damage to his bicycle. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982) (recovery for emotional and economic consequences of physical harm).  
24. Plaintiff’s total damages exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.  
25. Plaintiff was not contributorily negligent under G.L. c. 231, § 85; any alleged negligence on Plaintiff’s part was less than fifty percent and therefore does not bar recovery.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed **$25,000**, including:  
   1. Medical and dental expenses: approximately **$1,200.00**;  
   2. Lost wages: approximately **$800.00**;  
   3. Property damage to bicycle and equipment;  
   4. Pain and suffering, scarring, and emotional distress;  

B. Award prejudgment and postjudgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. Award costs of suit; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
