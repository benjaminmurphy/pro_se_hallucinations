**Docket No. ____________________**

**SARAH THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**JASON MILLER,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson** (“Mother”), and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2021**, by the **Middlesex County Probate and Family Court** regarding the minor child **Emily Miller (DOB: [redacted])**, on the grounds that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of said judgment, such that modification is warranted and necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. The Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother and primary custodial parent of **Emily Miller**, age 8.  

2. The Defendant, **Jason Miller**, formerly resided in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, but has now relocated or intends imminently to relocate to the State of New Hampshire for employment purposes.  

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 215, § 6**, as the original custody and parenting time order was issued by this Court.  

4. Venue is proper in this Division as the last judgment was entered here and the minor child resides within Middlesex County.  

---

### II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time, awarding **primary physical custody** of Emily Miller to the Mother, with the Father having parenting time each Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.  

6. That order was based on both parents residing in or near the Cambridge, Massachusetts area, and on the assumption that all school and extracurricular activities would occur within a local radius enabling short and reasonable travel times for the child.  

---

### III. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the entry of the May 15, 2021 order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances**, specifically the Father’s relocation from Middlesex County, Massachusetts to New Hampshire for employment.  

8. The Father now seeks to continue exercising the same midweek overnight parenting schedule despite the significant distance—approximately ninety (90) minutes each direction in traffic—between his new residence and the child’s school in Cambridge.  

9. The commute required to maintain this schedule has already caused significant disruption to the child’s rest, schooling, and extracurricular involvement. Emily has begun expressing anxiety regarding these extended drives and the resulting early morning departures to attend school following midweek visits.  

10. The current distance between the parties’ residences and the proposed travel schedule have rendered the existing parenting plan impracticable and contrary to the child’s best interests.  

11. Continued enforcement of the current midweek overnight arrangement would impair the minor child’s emotional stability, educational engagement, and overall well-being.  

---

### IV. ARGUMENT AND LEGAL AUTHORITY

12. Massachusetts law provides that a custody or parenting time order may be modified upon a showing of a “**material and substantial change in circumstances**” since entry of the prior judgment and that the proposed modification is in the **best interests of the child**. *See* **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20;** *Smith v. Smith*, 459 Mass. 1012 (2011); *Myrick v. Maloney*, 466 Mass. 727 (2014).  

13. The Court’s paramount consideration in matters of custody and parenting time is the **best interests of the child.** *See* *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006).  

14. The father’s relocation constitutes a significant shift affecting the feasibility of the existing parenting time order. Massachusetts appellate precedent recognizes that relocation and changes in a parent’s residence are quintessential examples of material changes warranting review. *See* *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Mason v. Coleman*, supra; *Wakefield v. Hegarty*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 772 (2006).  

15. Courts have consistently held that when a parenting plan becomes unworkable due to logistical impracticality or increased hardship on the child, modification is appropriate. *See* *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).  

16. The maintenance of a stable environment, consistent schooling, and regular access to community and extracurricular activities forms the cornerstone of the “best interests” analysis. *See* *Custody of Vaughan*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Chin v. Merriot*, 470 Mass. 527 (2015).  

17. Forcing Emily to endure long commutes multiple times per week for overnight visitation conflicts with the statutory aims of stability, developmental continuity, and emotional security contemplated by **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31** and related authority.  

18. Under *Hale v. Hale*, supra, and *Rosenthal v. Maney*, supra, continuity in a child’s routine and schooling outweighs a parent’s unilateral logistical preference, particularly where a schedule adjustment can preserve meaningful parenting time while minimizing disruption.  

19. Accordingly, modification is warranted to eliminate the Wednesday overnight visit and adjust the weekend schedule such that Emily’s interests remain primary while continuing substantial contact with both parents.

### V. REQUESTED RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2021 custody and parenting time order;  

B. Find that modifying the existing order is necessary and proper to serve the **best interests of Emily Miller**;  

C. Modify the Judgment to **eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight** parenting time, converting it instead to a single dinner visit or virtual contact at a mutually convenient time;  

D. Adjust the weekend parenting schedule, if necessary, to ensure the Father maintains meaningful and consistent contact with Emily without undue disruption to her schooling and well-being;  

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
