### COMPLAINT  
(NEGLIGENCE — PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff, **Emily Martinez**, hereby files this Complaint against Defendant, **Sarah Thompson**, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Emily Martinez** is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Her contact information is as follows: phone (617) 555‑0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. Defendant **Sarah Thompson** is an individual and the owner and manager of the residential property located at **123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603**, a three‑unit apartment building.  
3. At all times relevant, Defendant was responsible for the maintenance of the sidewalks adjacent to said property, including snow and ice removal.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has **subject matter jurisdiction** over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000.  
5. **Venue** is proper in the Worcester District Court under **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, because the tortious conduct and resulting injury occurred in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  
6. Defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in the Commonwealth under **G.L. c. 223A, § 3(a)**, as she resides and conducts business within Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On **February 15, 2023**, a significant snowstorm affected Worcester, Massachusetts.  
8. Defendant, as property owner, was responsible for maintaining the sidewalk abutting 123 Maple Street in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and members of the public.  
9. After the snowstorm, Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the center of the sidewalk and failed to apply any salt, sand, or other ice‑melting material.  
10. Over the following days, daytime melting and nighttime refreezing created a continuous sheet of ice on the sidewalk.  
11. Tenants of the property informed Defendant—via text messages and photographs—that the sidewalk had become dangerously icy.  
12. Defendant responded that “the sun will take care of it” and took no further remedial action.  
13. On the morning of **February 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully present on the premises delivering groceries to a tenant.  
14. While walking on the shoveled path, Plaintiff’s feet suddenly lost traction on an invisible ice sheet, causing her to fall backward and strike the ground forcefully on her lower back.  
15. Plaintiff experienced immediate pain and required medical attention for a lower back injury.  
16. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$3,500** in medical expenses and lost approximately **$800** in wages due to one week of missed work.  
17. Plaintiff’s injuries were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  
19. Under Massachusetts law, property owners owe lawful visitors a duty to maintain their property in a **reasonably safe condition** and to correct or warn of dangers of which they know or reasonably should know. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).  
20. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to properly remove snow and ice from the sidewalk adjacent to her property, consistent with **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), which abolished the natural‑accumulation rule and held that property owners must exercise reasonable care in managing snow and ice.  
21. Defendant breached this duty by failing to take reasonable steps—such as properly clearing ice, applying salt or sand, or warning invitees—after she knew or should have known of the hazardous condition. *See* **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 416 Mass. 825 (1994); **Barry v. Beverley Enterprises–Mass., Inc.**, 418 Mass. 590 (1994).  
22. Defendant’s conduct constituted negligence under **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343**, adopted in Massachusetts. *See* **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000).  
23. Massachusetts law imposes liability on a property owner where she causes or permits an accumulation of snow and ice that presents an unreasonable risk of harm. *See* **Papadopoulos**, supra; **Aylward v. McCloskey**, 412 Mass. 77 (1992).  
24. Defendant’s failure to act after receiving notice of the dangerous ice condition demonstrates reckless disregard for the safety of lawful entrants, in violation of the duty established in **Jette v. Boston**, 428 Mass. 536 (1998).  
25. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable and directly caused by Defendant’s negligence, as defined in **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 281** and recognized in **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
26. Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, medical expenses, wage loss, and pain and suffering as a proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions. *See* **Cannon v. Carroll**, 324 Mass. 343 (1949); **Fidler v. E.M. Parker Co.**, 394 Mass. 534 (1985).  
27. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, Plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest from the date of commencement of this action.

---

### V. DAMAGES

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained:  
   a. Medical expenses totaling approximately **$3,500**;  
   b. Lost wages totaling approximately **$800**;  
   c. Pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   d. Other compensable damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Martinez** respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:

1. **Compensatory damages** in an amount to be proven at trial, reasonably estimated to exceed **$4,300**;  
2. **Costs of suit**, including filing fees and service expenses pursuant to **G.L. c. 261, § 1**;  
3. **Prejudgment interest** under **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**; and  
4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38(b)**, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December 2025.**
