**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK RIVERA,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

---

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”),** and pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7, respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2019** by this Court concerning the minor child, **Ethan Thompson**, born in 2017. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1.  The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and primary custodial parent of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.  

2.  The Defendant, **Mark Rivera**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.  

3.  The parties were never married but share parental responsibility for their son pursuant to the Court’s prior custody orders.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4.  This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters of custody and visitation pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the original judgment of custody issued by this Probate and Family Court on **May 15, 2019**.

5.  Venue is proper in this Court as both parties and the minor child reside in Bristol County.

---

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6.  On **May 15, 2019**, this Court issued a custody and parenting order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of Ethan and awarding the Defendant three brief visits during the week plus a Sunday afternoon visit, with **no overnights**.  

7.  The 2019 custody schedule was based on circumstances existing at that time—specifically, that the Defendant lived in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have a suitable or private bedroom for the minor child.  

8.  Since entry of that order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** within the meaning of **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, such that the existing custody arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the child.  

9.  The Defendant now resides in his **own apartment**, which includes a separate bedroom for Ethan, providing a safe, stable, and appropriate environment for overnight parenting time.  

10.  The minor child, Ethan, is now **eight years old** and **attends school full time**. His developmental needs, school routines, and social maturity differ significantly from when the original custody order was entered at age three.  

11.  Under the current schedule, Ethan is shuttled back and forth for short visits during the school week, making it difficult to maintain consistent evening, homework, and bedtime routines.  

12.  Both parents **agree** that the existing schedule is no longer practical and that longer, less frequent visits — including overnight parenting time — are more appropriate for Ethan’s age and best interests.  

13.  The child has expressed a desire to spend **overnight time with his father**, reflecting his own growing relationship with both parents and sense of stability in each household.  

14.  The material changes described above directly affect the child’s welfare and warrant judicial modification of the prior custody order in accordance with **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); and **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

---

### IV. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION

15.  A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting order when there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the child**, per **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).  

16.  The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody determinations in the Commonwealth, see **Custody of a Minor**, 389 Mass. 755 (1983); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  

17.  Significant changes in a parent’s living situation and the child’s age, schooling, or developmental stage have repeatedly been held sufficient to justify modification. See **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); **Williams v. Massa**, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); **J.F. v. J.F.**, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 782 (2008).  

18.  The Court retains broad equitable powers to adjust parenting schedules where necessary to promote the stability and welfare of the child, **G.L. c. 215, § 6**; **Yannas**, 395 Mass. at 710.  

19.  Public policy strongly favors maintaining continuing and meaningful relationships between a child and both parents consistent with the child’s best interests, **G.L. c. 208, § 31**; **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

20.  Given these authorities, modification to provide more age-appropriate parenting time, including overnight visits, will substantially promote Ethan’s emotional, social, and academic well-being.  

---

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A.  Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the 2019 custody order;  

B.  Modify the existing custody and parenting plan to provide that:  
   1. The Defendant, Mark Rivera, shall have **overnight parenting time** with the minor child on alternating weekends from Friday after school until Sunday evening; and  
   2. Midweek visits shall be consolidated or adjusted to promote consistent school attendance, homework routines, and stability;  

C.  Order that both parents share joint legal custody, if not already ordered, and continue to communicate on all matters affecting the child’s education, health, and welfare;  

D.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

The Plaintiff therefore prays that this Court enter an order modifying the existing custody judgment dated May 15, 2019, consistent with the best interests of the minor child, recognizing the substantial positive changes in circumstances since the prior order, and providing for regular overnight parenting time with the Defendant as set forth above.
