PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BARNSTABLE DIVISION**

**DOCKET NO. _______**

**LAURA SMITH,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; c. 209, § 37; and related authorities)

---

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Smith**, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Laura Smith**, resides in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is  (617) 555‑0123 / psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. The Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, resides in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, though he has recently relocated to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Plaintiff’s residence.  

3. The parties are the parents of **Emily Johnson**, born [date omitted for privacy], presently eight (8) years old.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Honorable Court entered the original Judgment and Custody Order on **May 15, 2019**, giving Plaintiff primary physical custody of Emily and providing Defendant with parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesday nights.

5. The **Barnstable Probate and Family Court** has **continuing jurisdiction** over this matter pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31*, and *G.L. c. 215, § 6*, as both parents and the child remain Massachusetts residents.

6. Venue lies properly in this Court under Massachusetts law because the existing judgment was entered here and the child ordinarily resides within this jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS SHOWING MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. At the time of the 2019 order, the parties lived in the same town, and the midweek visitation was practical and consistent with the child’s welfare, as travel time to school was approximately five minutes.

8. The Defendant has since **relocated approximately ninety miles away, to Cape Cod**, creating a substantial burden on the child due to long-distance travel on school nights.

9. Despite this relocation, Defendant continues to exercise the Wednesday overnight. He collects Emily from school on Wednesday, drives her to Cape Cod, and then awakens her around 4:30 A.M. Thursday morning to drive her back to school.

10. This travel regime disrupts Emily’s sleep and causes **chronic fatigue**, resulting in **declining classroom participation and academic performance on Thursdays**, as documented by her teacher.

11. These facts constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the original custody judgment, requiring judicial review under *G.L. c. 208, § 28*, and Massachusetts caselaw.

12. The Plaintiff’s request for modification is made in **good faith** and is **child-focused**, seeking to diminish the harmful effects of prolonged midweek travel.

---

### IV. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION

13. Under *G.L. c. 208, § 28* (applicable to divorced parents) and *G.L. c. 209C, § 20* (for parents of children born out of wedlock, if applicable), a court may modify an existing custody order upon proof of a **material change in circumstances** and when such modification serves the **best interests of the child**.

14. In *Scholl v. Scholl*, 380 Mass. 232 (1980), the Supreme Judicial Court held that modification is proper when changed conditions affect the child’s welfare.

15. In *Cooper v. Cooper*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 51 (1997), the Appeals Court reaffirmed that the child’s best interest is paramount, especially when a parent’s relocation significantly impacts the custodial arrangement.

16. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) recognized relocation and burdensome travel as factors sufficient to warrant modification of parenting time schedules.

17. In *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), the SJC emphasized that the **best interests of the child** remain the controlling consideration in all custody matters.

18. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), confirmed that a “substantial change in distance” between homes and resultant educational or emotional disruption supports modification.

19. *Chicos v. Chicos*, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 568 (2008), further illustrated that modifications reducing disruption to the child’s education and stability serve their best interests.

20. Pursuant to *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006), educational continuity and adequate rest are valid, independent grounds for adjusting parenting schedules under § 28.

21. *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016), reaffirmed that practical difficulties caused by a parent’s relocation can justify eliminating midweek overnights.

22. *G.L. c. 208, § 31* mandates that custody decisions promote the child’s welfare and stability, with due regard to schooling, developmental needs, and the parties’ ability to cooperate.

23. Additional authorities supporting modification include *G.L. c. 208, § 28A*, permitting orders adjusted to serve the child's best interests, and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), underscoring the court’s discretion to respond when a prior arrangement no longer serves the child.

### V. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff **Laura Smith** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2019 Judgment;

B. **Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight** from the existing parenting plan, in light of the significant burden imposed by Defendant’s relocation and the resulting effect on the child’s rest and education;

C. **Modify the weekend parenting schedule**, if necessary, to provide reasonable and consistent parenting time that minimizes travel on school nights and promotes Emily’s best interests;

D. **Grant any further relief** this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

---

### VI. CERTIFICATION AND REQUEST FOR HEARING

Plaintiff requests that this Complaint be scheduled for hearing and that the Defendant be ordered to appear and show cause why the requested modification should not be granted.

---

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025.**
