---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 12, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and business invitee at Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

6. While shopping in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a visible **puddle of spilled milk** that had been left on the floor without any warning signs, cones, or other safety precautions.  

7. The puddle was of such size and duration that **shopping cart tracks were visible through it**, indicating that other customers had already passed through the area before the fall.  

8. An employee of Defendant was approximately fifteen feet away stocking shelves and admitted to Plaintiff that he had **noticed the spill several minutes earlier**, but had elected to finish his task before cleaning it up or posting warnings.  

9. As a direct result of stepping into the puddle, Plaintiff slipped and **fell hard on her hip**, sustaining an injury later diagnosed as a **hip sprain**.  

10. Plaintiff initially attempted to continue shopping but experienced increasing pain later that day.  

11. Plaintiff sought medical treatment at **urgent care the following day**, where she was examined and prescribed **physical therapy** for her injury.  

12. Plaintiff incurred **approximately $1,200** in medical bills and therapy costs.  

13. Plaintiff missed approximately **$800 in wages** from her employment at a local café due to pain and mobility limitations following the incident.  

14. Defendant, through its agents and employees, **owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care** to maintain the premises in a safe condition and to warn of known or reasonably discoverable hazards.  

15. Defendant, by its employee’s admission and failure to act, **breached that duty of care** by not promptly cleaning or isolating the spill, or providing adequate warning to customers.  

16. Defendant’s breach of duty was the **direct and proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injuries and economic losses.

---

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence**

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts law, an owner or occupier of land owes a **duty of reasonable care** to all lawful visitors to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  

19. Defendant had an affirmative duty to remedy or warn against hazards it **knew or should have known** about through reasonable inspection. See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); **Rossley v. S.S. Kresge Co.**, 339 Mass. 654 (1959).  

20. Defendant’s employee admitted **actual knowledge** of the dangerous condition yet chose to delay corrective action, constituting a breach of that duty. See **Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973) (knowledge of dangerous condition imposes duty to act).  

21. Even absent admitted knowledge, the existence of clear cart tracks demonstrates that the spill persisted long enough that Defendant **constructively knew or should have known** of its presence. See **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263 (1961).  

22. Defendant’s failure to clean or cordon off the spill or post visible warnings constituted **unreasonable conduct** endangering foreseeable customers. See **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007).  

23. Plaintiff, a business invitee, was entitled to assume that the premises were maintained in a safe condition. See **Young v. Food Fair, Inc.**, 337 Mass. 323 (1958).  

24. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries, pain, suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages. See **Jolicoeur v. Dudley Sav. Bank**, 384 Mass. 32 (1981).  

25. Plaintiff’s conduct was at all times reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, and she bears no comparative negligence. See **G.L. c. 231, §85**.  

26. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered significant **physical pain, emotional distress, and economic harm**, for which compensation is warranted under Massachusetts law. See **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982).

---

### IV. DAMAGES

27. Plaintiff has incurred **special damages** of approximately $2,000, consisting of $1,200 in medical expenses and $800 in lost wages.  

28. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent hip pain and limited mobility, entitling her to **compensatory damages** for pain and suffering. See **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 231, §6B** (interest on damages).  

29. Defendant’s conduct was careless and demonstrates a **reckless disregard for customer safety**, warranting full compensation under Massachusetts negligence principles.

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Fresh Mart Grocery, Inc.**;  
B. Award **compensatory damages** in an amount to be determined by a jury, reasonably estimated to exceed **$25,000**, inclusive of medical costs, lost wages, pain, and suffering;  
C. Award **statutory pre‑judgment interest** under **G.L. c. 231, §6B**;  
D. Award **costs of suit** pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---
