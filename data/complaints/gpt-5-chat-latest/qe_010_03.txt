### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852.  
   
2. The Defendant, **Linda Martinez** (“Defendant”), is an individual landlord doing business in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the owner or manager of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (“the Premises”).  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court and the events giving rise to this action occurred within Middlesex County.  

4. Venue is proper in the **Lowell District Court** pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, because the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, where the Defendant conducts business as a landlord.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the Premises, a residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, for a monthly rent of **$1,300**.  

6. The Premises includes a bathroom without a window, equipped solely with an exhaust fan for ventilation.  

7. Beginning around **September 2025**, mold began to develop in the bathroom, initially in the corner of the shower and subsequently spreading to the ceiling.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold and requested that she take action to remediate the condition.  

9. Defendant inspected the bathroom but refused to remedy the underlying cause, claiming the mold was due to Plaintiff’s showering habits and failure to operate the fan sufficiently.  

10. Despite Plaintiff’s regular use of the fan and ordinary showering practices, the mold has persisted and worsened over time.  

11. As a result of the persistent mold and excessive moisture, Plaintiff has suffered respiratory issues including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which her physician believes are linked to exposure to mold in the Premises.  

12. Plaintiff was required to dispose of personal property—including a shower curtain and towels—worth approximately **$60** due to mold contamination.  

13. Defendant has refused to provide effective remediation or improve ventilation, and continues to assert that Plaintiff is responsible for the condition.  

14. The continued presence of mold has rendered the bathroom and portions of the Premises unsafe and unfit for habitation, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the rental unit.  

15. Plaintiff estimates her damages, including personal property loss, health-related distress, interference with enjoyment of the premises, and statutory damages, to be **$200** or such amount as the Court determines to be just.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
*(G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts common law)*

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  

18. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from serious interference with the use of their premises as a residence. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977).  

19. A landlord’s failure to remedy conditions that threaten health or safety constitutes a breach of this covenant. See **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).  

20. The existence of mold caused by improper ventilation constitutes a condition interfering with quiet enjoyment and habitability. See **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982) (unsanitary conditions impair tenant’s enjoyment).  

21. Defendant’s refusal to correct the problem after notice constitutes an “act or omission” within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  

22. Massachusetts law requires that rental housing be kept in compliance with the **State Sanitary Code** (**105 C.M.R. § 410.750 et seq.**), including obligations to maintain plumbing, ventilation, and freedom from mold or excessive moisture (**105 C.M.R. § 410.750–410.820**).  

23. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in compliance with the Sanitary Code also violates **G.L. c. 111, § 127A**, which defines such substandard conditions as deleterious to health and unlawful for occupancy.  

24. Where a landlord fails to correct such unsanitary conditions after notice, the tenant may recover for breach of quiet enjoyment. See **McKenna v. Begin**, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 311 (1977); **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1979).  

25. The Defendant’s failure to act substantially deprived Plaintiff of the beneficial use of the apartment by forcing her to live in unsafe and unhealthy conditions. See **Gorrasi v. C.P. Reilly & Sons, Inc.**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 431, 436 (1982).  

26. Defendant’s inaction was willful, or at least negligent, constituting an ongoing violation of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breaches, Plaintiff has suffered damages including personal property loss, physical discomfort, health complications, and loss of use and enjoyment of the premises.
