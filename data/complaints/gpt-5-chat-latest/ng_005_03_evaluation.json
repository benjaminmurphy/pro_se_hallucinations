Ellard is the leading Massachusetts case that abolished the common\u2011law distinction between invitees and licensees and adopted a general duty of reasonable care owed by property owners/occupiers to lawful entrants. While the quoted passage is only a concurring opinion criticizing the continued special treatment of trespassers, the core decision of Mounsey supports the broader proposition that, under Massachusetts law, the standard is one of reasonable care in the ownership and control of property to avoid unreasonable risk of harm. The concurrence reinforces a move away from status-based duties, consistent with the claimed principle, but does not itself clearly extend the duty to all persons including trespassers.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. \u2026 The very effort at dry classification and differentiation puts the emphasis at the wrong places. Thus it is awkward to leave the suggestion that the basic reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion may stop short of so called trespassers."

It does not invoke Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 302 or 303, nor does it find a breach that constitutes actionable negligence for foreseeable property damage.
