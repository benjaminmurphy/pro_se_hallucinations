v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

---

### **I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Lisa McKenzie** (“Plaintiff”), pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2020**, to reflect a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor children, **Emma Johnson (age 8)** and **Noah Johnson (age 6)**. The Plaintiff seeks an order that adjusts the Defendant’s overnight parenting time to occur only when he is available and not working overnight shifts.

---

### **II. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Lisa McKenzie**, resides in **Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts**.  
   - Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   - Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. The Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, resides in **Middlesex County, Massachusetts** (exact address on record but omitted here for privacy).  

3. The parties are the parents of two minor children:  
   a. **Emma Johnson**, born [REDACTED] (age 8);  
   b. **Noah Johnson**, born [REDACTED] (age 6).  

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, as the original custody judgment was entered here on **May 15, 2020**.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** providing that the Plaintiff, Lisa McKenzie, would have **primary physical custody** and that the Defendant, Mark Johnson, would have **parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week**.

6. At the time of the 2020 order, both parents maintained regular daytime employment schedules consistent with a routine weekday and weekend arrangement. The schedule was developed in reliance on both parents’ availability during non‑work hours.

7. Since the entry of that judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances**. Specifically, in **2025**, the Defendant accepted new employment that requires him to work **7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. on multiple nights each week**, including many of the days when he is scheduled to exercise overnight parenting time.

8. As a result of this change:  
   a. The Defendant frequently returns the children to the Plaintiff with **little or no notice**, citing fatigue or the inability to supervise them properly after overnight work shifts.  
   b. On occasions when the Defendant attempts to exercise overnight parenting time, he has left the children in the care of **a roommate not known to the Plaintiff**, contrary to the spirit and intent of the original parenting plan.  
   c. The minor children have reported **falling asleep unsupervised or on the couch** while the Defendant rests after working overnight, demonstrating concerning lapses in supervision and stability.  

9. The Plaintiff has consistently cooperated with the Defendant to accommodate schedule changes as needed; however, the **persistent unpredictability** of the Defendant’s current work schedule has resulted in strain, confusion, and potential risk to the children’s welfare.

10. This rearrangement of circumstances directly impacts the **children’s best interests**, which, under **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, are paramount in any custody determination.

11. The existing order no longer serves the needs of the children or reflects the reality of the parents’ availability. A modified schedule ensuring overnights occur only when the Defendant is **not working overnight or recovering from such shifts** would better promote stability, consistency, and safety.

---

### **IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

12. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify an existing custody or visitation order upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and a finding that the modification will serve the children’s best interests.

13. The Defendant’s change to a rotating overnight work schedule constitutes such a **material change**, significantly affecting his capacity to provide direct care and supervision during designated parenting time.

14. Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly affirmed that changes in a parent’s employment, household conditions, or ability to exercise parenting time justify modification when they alter the foundation of the original order:

   - *Smith v. McDonald*, **458 Mass. 540 (2010)** (court may modify custody when changed circumstances affect child’s welfare).  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, **447 Mass. 177 (2006)** (best interests remain controlling standard).  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, **463 Mass. 488 (2012)** (stability and continuity are central to the best interests inquiry).  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, **51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)** (material change found where custodial schedule conflicted with parent’s work commitments).  
   - *Ireland v. Ireland*, **428 Mass. 1009 (1998)** (employment changes warrant review of prior custody arrangements).  
   - *Constantino v. Liu*, **90 Mass. App. Ct. 810 (2017)** (parent’s availability and supervision capabilities are central to custodial determinations).  
   - *Williams v. Massa*, **431 Mass. 619 (2000)** (the child’s stability and consistency of care take priority).  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, **12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)** (court must revisit custody when circumstances change materially).  
   - *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, **12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)** (parent’s change in living or work situation necessitates review of parenting plan).  
   - *Penny v. Penny*, **430 Mass. 24 (1999)** (the focus remains on promoting the welfare of the children amidst new facts).

15. Pursuant to these authorities, the Defendant’s overnight employment constitutes a material change that directly interferes with the schedule previously designed around both parents’ daytime availability.

16. Modification is therefore necessary and proper under **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60(b)**, **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, to realign the schedule with the children’s best interests and the parents’ current circumstances.

### **V. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Lisa McKenzie**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the May 15, 2020 custody judgment.  

2. **Modify** the parenting time order to provide that the Defendant shall have overnight parenting time **only on nights when he is not working overnight shifts** and is able to personally supervise the children.  

3. **Clarify** that if the Defendant is unable to exercise his scheduled time, reasonable notice shall be given to the Plaintiff to ensure stable arrangements for the children.  

4. **Grant** such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to serve the best interests and welfare of the minor children.
