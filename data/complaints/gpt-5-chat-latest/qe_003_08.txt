### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff**, *Sarah Johnson*, is an individual residing at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  
2. **Defendant**, *Mark Thompson*, is an individual and landlord doing business in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, with an address upon information and belief at 456 Parker Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02120.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §3 and G.L. c. 239, §8, as this is a landlord‑tenant dispute concerning residential premises located in Boston, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the leased premises—123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130—lies within its territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to lease a studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, for monthly rent of $1,500.  
6. During the pre‑rental showing, Plaintiff noticed water stains on the ceiling and specifically asked Defendant about them. Defendant represented that the stains were from an “old leak that had been totally fixed.”  
7. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, the first significant rainstorm caused water to leak through the same ceiling area.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water intrusion. Defendant responded that it was a “minor cosmetic issue” and took no meaningful reparative action.  
9. Over the following months, multiple rainstorms caused additional water infiltration, worsening ceiling damage, a musty odor, and apparent mold growth.  
10. As a direct result of the leak, Plaintiff’s couch became soaked and her laptop computer—valued at approximately $900—was destroyed.  
11. Plaintiff has repeatedly complained and requested repair, yet Defendant has refused or failed to fix the roof or remediate the mold.  
12. Plaintiff now must live in only part of the apartment, having moved her bed away from the damaged area to avoid dripping water and odor.  
13. The apartment’s condition has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the premises for its intended residential purpose.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered damages including property loss, diminished rental value, health discomfort, and emotional distress.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains a covenant of quiet enjoyment, express or implied, assuring the tenant’s right to undisturbed use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); G.L. c. 186, §14.  
17. Defendant’s failure to repair ongoing leaks, remediate moisture damage, and address mold constitutes an unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord responsible for permit‑ting interference with tenant’s use).  
18. The covenant is violated when the landlord allows conditions that render the premises substantially unsuitable for the purposes for which they were rented. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
19. Persistent water intrusion and mold growth make the premises uninhabitable and are well beyond “minor cosmetic issues.” *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 372 Mass. 136 (1977).  
20. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach under *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (breach found where landlord allowed conditions causing water leakage).  
21. Plaintiff duly provided notice to Defendant, satisfying the notice requirement specified in *Simon v. Solomon*, supra.  
22. Defendant’s refusal to correct the condition violates G.L. c. 186, §14 and entitles Plaintiff to actual and statutory damages, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, even though Plaintiff proceeds pro se. See *Meikle v. Nurse*, 474 Mass. 207 (2016).  
23. The ongoing leak and mold have deprived Plaintiff of the beneficial enjoyment of her home, a harm that Massachusetts courts recognize as precisely what the covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibits. *Yee v. Mass. State Racing Comm’n*, 481 Mass. 901 (2019); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); *Lipsitz v. Robbins*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 20 (1984).

### V. DAMAGES

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered the following harms:  
 a. Damage to personal property (laptop) – $900;  
 b. Diminished rental value and loss of use of part of the apartment;  
 c. Physical discomfort and headaches from mold exposure;  
 d. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life;  
 e. Costs and expenses associated with mitigating the damage.  
25. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages or three months’ rent—whichever is greater—plus reasonable costs. Three months’ rent amounts to $4,500, which exceeds her actual losses and is therefore recoverable as statutory damages.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages of three months’ rent ($4,500) or her actual damages ($900), whichever is greater;  
C. Order Defendant to promptly repair the leak, remediate all water and mold damage, and ensure the premises meet the Massachusetts Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. §410.100 et seq.;  
D. Award Plaintiff her costs and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper;  
E. Grant any further equitable or injunctive relief necessary to secure Plaintiff’s full quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
