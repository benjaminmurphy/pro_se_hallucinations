Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL DAVIS,**  
Defendant.  
____________________________________  

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY JUDGMENT  
(Filed Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and related authorities)  

**Filed:** December 1, 2025

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the mother of the minor child, *Emily Davis (age 9)*.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Davis, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the father of the same minor child.  
3. The parties are currently subject to a custody and parenting-time judgment entered by this Court on June 15, 2021.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody matters of the parties under *G.L. c. 208, § 28* (modification of judgments concerning custody and support of minor children) and *G.L. c. 215, § 6*.  
5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, Woburn Division, because the original judgment issued from this Court and the child resides within the jurisdiction.

---

### III. CURRENT CUSTODY ORDER

6. The existing Judgment of June 15, 2021, provides:  
   a. The parties share **joint legal custody** of the minor child;  
   b. The Plaintiff is designated **primary residential parent**;  
   c. The Defendant has substantial **weekend parenting time**, including Sunday overnights; and  
   d. Both parents shall **cooperate on school matters** and **keep each other informed** of the child’s educational progress.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the June 15, 2021 judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that directly affects the child’s welfare, educational progress, and stability.  
8. Over the past year, the Defendant has regularly withheld the child from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, justifying these absences as “mental health days,” without medical documentation or school authorization.  
9. As a result, the minor child’s **attendance record has deteriorated**, and the school has issued **truancy warnings** to both parents.  
10. The Defendant has also **refused to transport the child to tutoring sessions** scheduled during his parenting time, disrupting the child’s educational interventions recommended by the school.  
11. The child’s **academic performance has declined**, with lower grades and standardized test scores compared to her prior performance under the 2021 arrangement.  
12. These developments constitute a substantial change in circumstances adversely affecting the minor child’s best interests.

---

### V. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

13. Pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28*, “upon a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties, the court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children if the modification is in the best interests of the children.”  
14. A modification is warranted where the existing arrangement no longer serves the child’s best interests. *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).  
15. Courts have consistently held that chronic school absenteeism, educational decline, and a parent’s unwillingness to cooperate on school matters may justify modification of custody. *See* **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).  
16. Massachusetts law favors arrangements that ensure stability and educational continuity for children. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  
17. When joint legal custody is undermined by one parent’s failure to cooperate on significant issues, modification may be required to appoint one parent as final decision-maker in the child’s educational matters. *See* **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  
18. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody decisions. *See* **G.L. c. 208, § 31**; **Blixt v. Blixt**, 437 Mass. 649 (2002).  
19. In light of these authorities and the facts described herein, modification of the current order is necessary to safeguard the child’s educational welfare and emotional stability.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

20. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the June 15, 2021 custody judgment as follows:  
   a. Grant Plaintiff **final decision-making authority with respect to the child’s education and school attendance**, including authority to determine when the child should attend school, to arrange tutoring services, and to authorize absences; **or**, in the alternative,  
   b. Modify Defendant’s **parenting schedule** to eliminate Sunday overnight parenting time, ensuring that the child is in Plaintiff’s care Sunday evenings through Monday mornings, thereby improving school attendance and consistency.  
21. Plaintiff further seeks any additional orders the Court deems necessary to advance the child’s best interests, including specific requirements for school communication and attendance compliance.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, **Plaintiff Jessica Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the June 15, 2021 judgment;  
2. **Modify custody** to provide Plaintiff with final educational decision-making authority, or alternatively, adjust the Defendant’s parenting schedule to eliminate school-night overnights;  
3. Enter any further orders necessary to secure the child’s **consistent school attendance, academic progress, and best interests**;  
4. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
