---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the tortious acts and resulting injuries occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about April 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging in Whiting Park, located in Newton, Massachusetts.  
6. Whiting Park is a public park where dogs are required to be kept on leashes, as posted by signage at multiple entrances, pursuant to Newton City Ordinances and G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157.  
7. Defendant was in Whiting Park that day accompanied by a large dog under his ownership and control.  
8. At the time of the incident, Defendant’s dog was not leashed, despite Defendant having a leash draped over his shoulder.  
9. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from his unleashed dog, engaged in conversation with other individuals.  
10. Defendant’s dog suddenly charged at Plaintiff, barking aggressively.  
11. Plaintiff, fearing imminent harm and potential attack, swerved off the park path in an attempt to avoid the charging animal.  
12. As a result of this evasive action, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root and fell down a small embankment.  
13. Plaintiff immediately felt sharp pain and later discovered she had sustained a broken wrist.  
14. Several other park visitors and joggers witnessed the incident.  
15. Defendant eventually called back the dog and acknowledged that it had not been leashed.  
16. Plaintiff was transported to a local emergency room, where she received treatment for a fractured wrist.  
17. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately Five Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($5,200).  
18. Plaintiff also lost wages of approximately Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) due to time missed from work during her recovery.  
19. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, and inconvenience as a result of her injuries.  
20. Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to properly control his dog and comply with the applicable leash laws.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Negligence**

21. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully set forth herein.  
22. To state a claim for negligence under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must establish that (a) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, (b) the defendant breached that duty, (c) the plaintiff suffered actual damage, and (d) the breach was the cause of the damage. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
23. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to control his animal and to act as a reasonable person under the circumstances, including compliance with applicable leash ordinances and statutes. *See* **Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.**, 283 Mass. 158 (1933); **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
24. Defendant breached this duty by allowing his large dog to run loose in an area where dogs are required to be leashed. *See* **G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157**; **Curran v. Burkhardt**, 310 Mass. 466 (1941) (liability for failing to control domestic animal).  
25. Defendant’s conduct created a foreseeable risk of harm to park users such as Plaintiff. *See* **Jupin**, supra; **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302, 518**.  
26. Defendant’s breach of duty directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries. *See* **Abramian v. President & Fellows of Harvard College**, 432 Mass. 107 (2000).  
27. The law recognizes that where an injury results from a person’s reasonable reaction to a foreseeable danger created by another’s negligence, the original wrongdoer remains liable. *See* **Lane v. Atlantic Works**, 111 Mass. 136 (1872); **Tuttle v. Atlantic City R.R. Co.**, 145 Mass. 175 (1887); **Conners v. Northeast Hosp. Corp.**, 439 Mass. 469 (2003).  
28. Defendant’s failure to leash his dog and prevent it from charging at others constitutes conduct falling below the standard of reasonable care.  
29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained serious injuries, including a fractured wrist, resulting in medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering.  
30. Defendant’s actions were in violation of G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157; G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence standard); and the City of Newton Animal Control Ordinances requiring leashing of dogs in public parks.  
31. Plaintiff’s own conduct was reasonable under the circumstances, as she acted instinctively and prudently to avoid an imminent perceived danger. *See* **Robbins v. Atkins**, 413 Mass. 377 (1992).  

---

### **V. DAMAGES**

32. As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, emotional distress, and financial losses, including but not limited to approximately $5,200 in medical expenses, $2,000 in lost wages, and compensation for pain and suffering.  
33. Plaintiff is entitled to recover those damages from Defendant pursuant to Massachusetts common law of negligence. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982); **Ward v. American Mutual Liability Ins. Co.**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 98 (1983).

C. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
