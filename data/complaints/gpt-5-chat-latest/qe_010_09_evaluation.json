The court emphasizes that the landlord\u2019s conduct (including what is \u2018failed to do\u2019 or \u2018permitted to be done\u2019) can violate quiet enjoyment when it results in premises that are not reasonably habitable. By analogy, permitting persistent mold and refusing to repair ventilation defects that substantially interfere with habitability fits squarely within this principle, so the case provides supportive authority at a general doctrinal level.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done. \u2026 Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable."

Although the facts involve flooding rather than mold or ventilation defects specifically, the court\u2019s reasoning is grounded in the landlord\u2019s duty to maintain habitable, sanitary premises and recognizes that permitting recurring unsanitary conditions that substantially impair use of the unit constitutes interference with quiet enjoyment. Thus it supports, by close analogy, the proposition that persistent, unrepaired habitability defects (like mold/ventilation problems) can amount to substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe water in Solomon\u2019s apartment was a preventable situation, and one that Gem had a duty to prevent. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. 410.500; Crowell v. McCaffrey\u2026 Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway\u2026 The jury found in answer to a special question\u2026 that the water interfered with Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment of her apartment. Therefore, Gem is liable under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u2026 Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

While it cites examples of serious conditions (including Simon v. Solomon), this opinion itself does not involve or hold that persistent mold or ventilation defects constitute a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. It therefore does not affirm the specific proposition about mold and ventilation problems; at most it distinguishes lesser conditions from those that would qualify.",

Rather, the implied warranty of habitability applies to significant defects in the property itself. Berman & Sons v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 201-202 (1979) (\u2018A dwelling afflicted with a substantial Sanitary Code violation is not habitable\u2019). \u2026 The natural accumulation of snow and ice is not such a defect.\u201d"

The court expressly limits breach of the implied warranty of habitability to defects in physical facilities and refuses to treat nonphysical conditions (like criminal activity) as habitability breaches, and its quiet-enjoyment analysis is tied to the landlord\u2019s inaction regarding third-party criminal conduct, not maintenance problems. Thus, it does not provide authority that persistent mold and unremedied ventilation defects constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe conclude that the implied warranty of habitability is concerned with the provision, maintenance, and repair of the physical facilities vital to the use of the leased premises, and is not breached solely by the presence on the premises of uninvited persons engaged in unlawful activities or by the failure to provide security services. \u2026 In this case, we have no doubt that, if the plaintiffs truly are unable to use the common areas of the development\u2026 then the situation constitutes a serious interference with their quiet enjoyment\u2026 .\u201d"
