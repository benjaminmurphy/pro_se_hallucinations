We agree that there was a duty of reasonable care in this case and find no public policy justification for refusing to impose it. \u2026 As in Pine Manor, the risk in the instant case \u2014 that a mentally unstable and violent person\u2026would take a gun from that home and shoot someone \u2014 was both foreseeable and foreseen."
