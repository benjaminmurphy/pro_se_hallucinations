v.  

**MICHAEL REYNOLDS,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, *Sophia Reynolds* (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully moves this Honorable Court, pursuant to *G.L. c. 208, § 28* and *G.L. c. 209C, § 20*, to modify the existing custody order entered on **May 15, 2018** by this Court, and for reasons states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Sophia Reynolds**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child **Ethan Reynolds**, age 8.  
2. The Defendant, **Michael Reynolds**, is the father of the minor child. He resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to *G.L. c. 209C*, *G.L. c. 208, § 28*, and *Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 12* and *25* as this Court issued the original custody judgment and both parties continue to reside in Massachusetts.  

---

## **II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

4. On **May 15, 2018**, this Court entered an order granting *primary physical custody* of the minor child, Ethan Reynolds, to the Plaintiff, and *parenting time* to the Defendant consisting of three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit—*without overnight visits*.  
5. At that time, Ethan was **three years old**, and the Defendant lived in a rented room within a shared apartment with multiple roommates; the Court found that there was no suitable overnight space for the child.  
6. The Defendant now has a **suitable, independent apartment**, where Ethan has his **own bedroom** with appropriate sleeping arrangements and space.  
7. Ethan is now **eight years old**, attending school full-time, and has expressed a consistent desire for overnight visits at his father’s home.  
8. The current visitation schedule—three short weekday visits and a Sunday afternoon—causes significant disruption to Ethan’s school routines, bedtime, and homework schedule, and results in unnecessary back-and-forth travel between parents’ homes.  
9. Both parents acknowledge these logistical and developmental changes and agree in principle that a revised schedule allowing overnights and reducing weekday transitions would best serve Ethan’s needs.  
10. These circumstances constitute a **material and substantial change** since entry of the prior order, requiring modification to reflect Ethan’s current developmental stage, the father’s improved housing situation, and the child’s best interests.  

---

## **III. LEGAL STANDARD**

11. Under *G.L. c. 208, § 28*, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and a determination that modification is in the **best interests of the child**.  
12. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a parent seeking modification must demonstrate (a) a material change since the prior order, and (b) that the requested change will promote the child’s welfare and stability. *See, e.g.*, **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **White v. LaDue**, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 430 (1997).  
13. Developmental needs of the child and improved circumstances of a parent—such as availability of suitable housing—may constitute such a change. *See* **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).  
14. The “best interests of the child” is the controlling standard, requiring the Court to consider the totality of circumstances, including emotional bonds, continuity, and parental fitness. *See* **G.L. c. 208, § 31**; **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Care & Protection of Three Minors**, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).  
15. Courts may also consider the reasonableness and cooperation of the parents where, as here, both assent to modification designed to better meet the child’s needs. *See* **Rosenberg v. Merida**, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).  
16. The Massachusetts statutory framework provides discretion to the Court to alter custody and parenting time to adapt to evolving circumstances and maintain consistency and stability in the child’s upbringing. *See* **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 209C, § 20**; *See also* **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

17. Since the original order, there have been multiple **material changes**:  
   a. Michael Reynolds has established **stable and appropriate housing** suitable for overnight visits;  
   b. The minor child, Ethan, is now five years older and **developmentally at a stage** where extended overnight and weekend parenting time is appropriate;  
   c. The existing schedule disrupts the child’s sleep, school, and extracurricular routines;  
   d. Both parents are cooperative and in agreement that a schedule revision is in their son’s best interest.  

18. Courts routinely recognize that such factors—including a parent’s improved ability to provide suitable accommodations and maturation of the child—constitute a basis for modification. *See* **Rosenberg**, supra; **Pizzino**, supra; **White**, supra; **Schuler**, supra.  

---

## **V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD**

19. The requested modification aligns with Ethan’s developmental needs by:  
   a. Reducing school-night transitions;  
   b. Allowing consistent, meaningful time with both parents;  
   c. Promoting emotional stability and positive father-child bonding;  
   d. Reflecting both parents’ cooperative approach to shared parenting.  
20. The modification sought is modest, reasonable, and intended to sustain Ethan’s wellbeing, stability, academic progress, and security within both parental homes.  
21. The proposed change comports with the statutory and case law mandate that parenting plans evolve with a child’s needs and the parents’ circumstances. *See* **Custody of Kali**, supra; **Mason v. Coleman**, supra.  

---

## **VI. REQUESTED RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE,** the Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Judgment dated May 15, 2018;  
2. **Modify the existing custody and parenting time order** to provide for:  
   a. Continued joint legal custody;  
   b. Primary physical custody remaining with Plaintiff, with **expanded parenting time** for Defendant including overnights and alternating weekends;  
   c. Such weekday and weekend schedule as the Court finds consistent with the child’s best interests;  
3. **Grant such further relief** as this Court deems just and proper.
