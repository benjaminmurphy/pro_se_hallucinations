### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about March 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease agreement with the Defendant to rent a basement apartment located at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff’s rent under the lease agreement is $1,200 per month.  
7. Throughout the tenancy, Plaintiff has paid rent in full, except that rent for October 2025 was paid approximately two weeks late, including all agreed late fees.  
8. Beginning in or about November 2025, Plaintiff began to experience water infiltration through the basement wall of the leased premises during rainfall.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water intrusion via text message and requested that repairs be made.  
10. Defendant responded that she would “look into it” but failed to make any meaningful repair or mitigation within a reasonable period of time.  
11. The water infiltration continued, causing damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and bookshelf, resulting in losses of approximately $400.  
12. The wet conditions also required Plaintiff to continually operate a dehumidifier, increasing Plaintiff’s electricity costs.  
13. On or about November 20, 2025, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department to report the ongoing water issue and related code violations.  
14. A city inspector subsequently visited the property, confirmed multiple violations of the State Sanitary Code under 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., and cited the landlord accordingly.  
15. After the city inspection, Defendant told Plaintiff that he was a “problem tenant” and stated that she would not renew his lease when it expires in March 2026.  
16. Defendant asserted that her decision not to renew was due to Plaintiff’s previously late rent; however, the timing of this decision closely followed the code enforcement inspection initiated by Plaintiff.  
17. The water infiltration remains unresolved as of the filing of this Complaint.  
18. Defendant’s failure to repair the condition and her retaliatory actions have caused Plaintiff substantial distress, property damage, and interference with the beneficial use of his home.

### COUNT I  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 above.  
20. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).  
21. General Laws c. 186, § 14 prohibits landlords from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment by any act or omission.  
22. Defendant’s failure to remedy the defective and unsafe conditions within the apartment constitutes such interference. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977) (landlord liable for interference arising from negligent failure to control property conditions).  
23. The uncorrected flooding and moisture rendered portions of the leased premises unsuitable for normal residential use, violating the implied warranty of habitability and impairing the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. *See* **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).  
24. The continuing leaks and moisture problems constitute an ongoing substantial interference with the Plaintiff’s tenancy. *See* **Doe v. Stanton**, 147 F. Supp. 2d 332, 338 (D. Mass. 2001).  
25. Defendant’s omission to correct the water infiltration despite notice violates applicable health and housing codes, including 105 C.M.R. 410.500 (requiring watertight walls) and 410.750 (landlord repair obligations).  
26. Defendant’s dereliction of duty is a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property loss and discomfort, contrary to **Jablonski v. Clemons**, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 477 (2004) (holding landlord liable for failing to correct known water intrusion).  
27. Defendant’s subsequent actions — labeling Plaintiff a “problem tenant” and refusing lease renewal following his lawful code complaint — further evidence interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and retaliation prohibited under G.L. c. 186, §§ 14 and 18. *See* **Spence v. O’Brien**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 491 (1983).  
28. Plaintiff has suffered tangible damages, including the loss of personal property valued at approximately $400, additional electricity costs, loss of use and enjoyment of the premises, and emotional distress. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 102 (emotional distress compensable under § 14).  
29. Defendant’s interference was intentional or, at minimum, reckless and in disregard of the Plaintiff’s rights. *See* **Alves v. Daly**, 2009 Mass. App. Div. 1, 5 (2009).

### DAMAGES

30. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to the greater of actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.  
31. Three months’ rent at Plaintiff’s rate equals $3,600, which exceeds the estimated property loss and associated costs.  
32. Accordingly, Plaintiff demands statutory damages in the amount of $3,600, or such greater amount as the Court deems just and proper.

C. Order Defendant to correct and remediate the ongoing water infiltration and related violations in the leased premises;
