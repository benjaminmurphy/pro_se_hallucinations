      "support_reasoning": "The opinion clearly states that to modify a judgment for alimony or child support the petitioner must show a material change in circumstances. It then adds that, in child support cases, the judge must consider the circumstances of the parents and the benefit/needs of the children, but it does not structure this as a required, separate second prong nor as a consistent two-part test. Thus Schuler supports the material-change requirement, but not the specific two-part formulation claimed in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo be successful in an action to modify a judgment for alimony or child support, the petitioner must demonstrate a material change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment. \u2026 In determining whether to modify a support or alimony order, a probate judge must weigh all relevant circumstances. \u2026 An order for child support may be modified \u2018as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.\u2019 G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28\u2026 The needs of the children, the financial status of the support provider, and the station in life of the respective parties must all be considered.\u201d"
