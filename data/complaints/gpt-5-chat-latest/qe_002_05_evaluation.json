Thus it does not directly support the proposition that the defendant\u2019s failure to repair \u201cviolated her duties under G.L. c. 111, \u00a7 127A, and the State Sanitary Code\u201d as an independent violation, though it is persuasive background authority for using those sources to define the landlord\u2019s duty to keep the unit safe and sanitary.",
