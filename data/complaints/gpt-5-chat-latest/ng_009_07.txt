Civil Action No. _______

### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

---

Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), hereby brings this Complaint against Defendant, Lynn Apartments, LLC (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 3C, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.  
2. Defendant Lynn Apartments, LLC is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and doing business as the owner and manager of residential properties, including the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 and G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 21 because the events giving rise to this action occurred within Essex County, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the Defendant conducts business in Lynn and the subject property is located within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff resides in a third-floor apartment within the building owned and operated by Defendant at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.  
6. Defendant, as landlord, is responsible for maintaining the common areas of the building, including the hallways and safety equipment such as smoke detectors, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 15F and 105 CMR 410.482.  
7. For several months prior to September 15, 2023, the smoke detector in the third-floor common hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit emitted a repetitive low-battery alarm, indicating it required maintenance or a battery replacement.  
8. An unknown individual subsequently removed the battery from the detector and left it on a windowsill in the hallway, rendering the device inoperable.  
9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the malfunctioning and ultimately disabled smoke detector on at least three separate occasions.  
10. Despite such notice, Defendant failed and neglected to take any remedial action to repair or replace the battery or otherwise restore the smoke detector to proper working order.  
11. On or about September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment within the same building, reportedly originating in the kitchen.  
12. Because the hallway smoke detector on Plaintiff’s floor had no functional battery, it failed to sound an alarm or provide any warning of the fire.  
13. Plaintiff first became aware of the fire only upon smelling smoke and discovering that the hallway was filled with dense smoke.  
14. Plaintiff experienced significant difficulty breathing and became disoriented while attempting to exit the building.  
15. Plaintiff was transported to a local hospital, where she was treated for smoke inhalation and respiratory distress.  
16. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately **$10,500** and lost wages of approximately **$2,000** due to missed work during her recovery.  
17. Plaintiff also sustained property damage and emotional distress as a direct result of the fire incident.  
18. Defendant’s failure to maintain the smoke detector in operable condition directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

### IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain the common areas of the building, including safety devices such as smoke detectors, in a safe and operable condition.  *See* *Lindsey v. Massios*, 372 Mass. 79, 82 (1977) (landlords owe tenants a duty of reasonable care).  
21. Defendant’s statutory duty is further established under **G.L. c. 143, §§ 3–7**, applicable building and fire safety codes, and **105 CMR 410.482**, which require landlords to maintain functional smoke detectors in common areas.  
22. Defendant had actual and constructive notice of the defective condition for an extended period before the fire.  *See* *Poitras v. Friendly Home, Inc.*, 375 Mass. 117, 121 (1978).  
23. Defendant failed to act despite Plaintiff’s repeated reports and complaints, demonstrating a breach of reasonable care.  *See* *King v. G & M Realty Corp.*, 373 Mass. 658, 663 (1977) (failure to repair known dangerous conditions constitutes actionable negligence).  
24. Defendant’s breach of duty directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s physical injuries, financial loss, and emotional distress.  *See* *Jersey v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.*, 367 Mass. 491, 495 (1975).  
25. Massachusetts law recognizes a landlord’s duty to maintain premises in safe condition even for hazards in common areas.  *See* *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Grady v. Shepard*, 212 Mass. 422, 424 (1912).  
26. Defendant’s inaction constitutes negligence per se under G.L. c. 143 and applicable housing regulations.  *See* *Hamilton v. Ganias*, 417 Mass. 593, 595 (1994).  
27. Defendant's omission foreseeably caused Plaintiff's injuries.  *See* *J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio*, Tort Law § 278 (3d ed. 2005); *Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.*, 430 Mass. 694, 698 (2000).  
28. But for Defendant’s negligence in maintaining the smoke detector system, Plaintiff would have received timely warning of the fire, avoided smoke inhalation, and reduced property losses.  
29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical injury and illness;  
   b. Emotional distress;  
   c. Medical expenses totaling approximately $10,500;  
   d. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $2,000; and  
   e. Property damage resulting from smoke and water exposure.

### V. DAMAGES

30. Plaintiff has suffered total damages exceeding **$12,500**, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.  
31. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all compensatory damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with interest under G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B–6C.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. For compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$12,500**;  
B. For interest and costs as provided by law;  
C. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
