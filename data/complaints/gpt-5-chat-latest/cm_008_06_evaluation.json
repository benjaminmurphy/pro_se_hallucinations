See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003) (\u201cIf the parenting arrangement in which a child has lived is satisfactory and is reasonably capable of preservation, it is ordinarily in the child\u2019s best interests to maintain that arrangement, and contrary to the child\u2019s best interest to disrupt it.
