### II. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jordan Reynolds** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Boston, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant **QuickRide Rideshare, LLC** (“QuickRide” or “Defendant”) is a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, operating a ridesharing service employing or contracting with drivers who use automobiles to transport passengers for a fee.

---

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under **G.L. c. 212, § 4** and **G.L. c. 223A, § 3**, because the tortious conduct occurred within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On **August 15, 2023**, at approximately 8:15 a.m., Plaintiff was riding a bicycle eastbound on **Commonwealth Avenue in Boston**, in a clearly marked bicycle lane adjacent to the curb.  
6. Plaintiff was operating the bicycle lawfully, wearing a protective helmet, and exercising due care as required by **G.L. c. 85, § 11B**.  
7. A rideshare driver operating under the platform QuickRide was parked or stopped in a designated loading zone parallel to the bike lane outside **1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts**.  
8. Without warning and without checking for oncoming bicyclists or traffic, the driver suddenly opened the driver-side door into the bike lane.  
9. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to swerve or stop before colliding with the opened door.  
10. The edge of the door struck Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s bicycle, causing Plaintiff to be thrown onto the pavement, suffering visible abrasions, soft tissue injuries, and damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle and personal property.  
11. At the scene, the driver stated, “I didn’t see you; I was checking my phone.”  
12. The same driver later provided a conflicting statement to his insurer, alleging Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” a fabrication inconsistent with the physical layout of the roadway and eyewitness observations.  
13. Plaintiff was transported for medical evaluation and incurred medical expenses totaling approximately **$1,200.00** for treatment of road rash and dental repair of a chipped tooth.  
14. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent beyond repair, requiring replacement at personal cost.  
15. Plaintiff lost approximately **$400.00** in wages due to inability to work while recovering.  
16. Plaintiff’s injuries, property losses, and related out-of-pocket expenses were directly and proximately caused by the Defendant’s driver’s negligent conduct.

### V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
18. At all relevant times, the driver acted as an employee, agent, servant, or ostensible agent of Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC, which is vicariously liable under **respondeat superior** principles. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317 (2002); *Kelly v. Ryder Student Transp. Servs., Inc.*, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 759 (2008).  
19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to ensure that its drivers operated vehicles safely and in compliance with Massachusetts traffic and bicycle safety laws. See *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
20. Under **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, no person shall open the door of a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so and can be done without interfering with the movement of other traffic. The Defendant, through its driver, breached this statutory duty.  
21. Defendant’s breach of this duty constitutes negligence per se. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355 (1990); *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).  
22. Defendant further owed a duty to train and supervise its drivers to avoid foreseeable risks to bicyclists using the public roadways, as recognized under *Cottam v. CVS Pharmacy*, 436 Mass. 316 (2002) and *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006).  
23. Defendant breached those duties by failing to ensure its driver followed safe procedures when exiting a vehicle near an active bicycle lane and by failing to adequately instruct its drivers regarding bicycle lane safety.  
24. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, physical pain, emotional distress, and financial loss. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs.*, 386 Mass. 540 (1982); *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986).  
25. Plaintiff’s comparative fault, if any, was less than 51% of the total fault, and Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recovery under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**.  
26. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer physical injuries, pain and suffering, lost wages, and expenses, and will continue to incur damages in the future. See *Shantigar Found. v. Bear Mountain Builders*, 441 Mass. 131 (2004); *Hendrickson v. Sears*, 365 Mass. 83 (1974).
