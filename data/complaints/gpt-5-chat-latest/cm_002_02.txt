**Docket No._________**  

**LAURA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK DAVIS,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Laura Thompson**, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on **March 15, 2020**, in the above-captioned matter, regarding the parties’ minor child, **Sophie Davis**, born [date omitted for privacy].  

In support of this Complaint for Modification, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Laura Thompson**, resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, **Mark Davis**, currently resides in (or intends to relocate to) New Hampshire.  
3. The parties are the parents of one minor child: **Sophie Davis**, age 8.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** (for married parties) and/or **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** (for unmarried parents), which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and visitation orders when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court as the original custody judgment was entered in the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court.  

---

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6. On or about **March 15, 2020**, this Court entered an order establishing custody and parenting time for the parties’ daughter, **Sophie Davis**.  
7. The order provides that the Plaintiff has **primary physical custody**, and the Defendant has parenting time with Sophie on **Wednesdays** and **every other weekend**.  
8. The prior order was expressly based on the understanding that both parents resided in the **Cambridge area**, allowing the minor child to attend a local school and maintain a stable weekday schedule and after-school activities.  
9. The Defendant has now announced his intention to **relocate to New Hampshire** for employment, approximately **ninety minutes (90)** from the child’s school and primary residence, and wishes to maintain the same midweek and weekend visitation schedule.  
10. If the current schedule were to remain in effect, Sophie would be required to endure long commutes during school nights, lose sleep, miss after-school activities, and experience significant disruption to her daily routine and social life.  
11. Sophie has already expressed **anxiety and distress** about the lengthy car rides and the disruption to her established activities and friendships.  
12. The proposed relocation and the resulting commuting burdens constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** significantly affecting the child’s welfare.  
13. Continuation of the current schedule under these new conditions is **not in the best interests of the child**.

---

### IV. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, custody and visitation orders “may be modified if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  
15. The Plaintiff submits that such a material and substantial change has occurred, namely the Defendant’s **relocation out of state** and the resulting impracticality and harm of the current parenting schedule.  
16. Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly held that relocation, travel burdens, and changes in a parent’s circumstances that affect the child’s welfare constitute grounds for modification. See:  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (relocation evaluated under best interests and real advantage standards);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (custody and visitation modifications must serve child’s best interests under changed circumstances);  
   - *Williams v. Pitney*, 409 Mass. 449 (1991) (material change standard applies prior to considering best interests);  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (substantial changes in living arrangements justify modification to protect child’s welfare);  
   - *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (court may modify order when circumstances render prior judgment unfair or unworkable);  
   - *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (midweek parenting time impractical due to distance warranted modification);  
   - *J.F. v. D.F.*, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 782 (2008) (best interests analysis central to all custody modifications);  
   - *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (court must assess actual impact of changed circumstances on child);  
   - *Macri v. Macri*, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 362 (2019) (travel and interference with school or routines evidence material change);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (stability and continuity for child’s welfare are paramount).  
17. The continued enforcement of midweek overnight visits would cause instability, fatigue, and stress for Sophie, undermining her school attendance, rest, and participation in extracurricular activities, contrary to her best interests.  
18. The Plaintiff has acted in good faith and seeks only to establish a schedule that reflects the child’s evolving needs in light of the father’s relocation.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Eliminate the **Wednesday overnight visit**, replacing it with a **Wednesday evening dinner visit** or such other contact the Court deems appropriate and in the minor child’s best interests;  

b. Adjust the parenting time schedule to provide the Defendant with **longer blocks of time on weekends or school vacations** as may be appropriate to maintain a meaningful relationship between father and daughter without disrupting schooling and daily routines;  

c. Order that all exchanges occur in a manner considerate of the child’s travel time, schooling schedule, and extracurricular activities; and  

d. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred due to the Defendant’s relocation;  
2. Modify the existing custody and parenting plan to reflect a schedule consistent with the minor child’s **best interests**, as proposed above; and  
3. Grant all other relief deemed just and proper under the circumstances.
