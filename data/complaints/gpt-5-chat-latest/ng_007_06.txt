### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s minor son A.J. was attending Defendant’s after-school program at its premises at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA.  

6. Defendant advertised that children attending the program would be “supervised at all times” while participating in gym activities.  

7. On the date of the incident, two staff members were assigned to supervise approximately twenty children in the gymnasium.  

8. One staff member left the gym to complete paperwork in the office, leaving a single employee to monitor all twenty children.  

9. The remaining staff member sat near the bleachers and was using her cellular phone rather than actively supervising the children.  

10. While unsupervised, two older and larger boys—approximately twelve years of age—began engaging in rough tackle play on the hardwood gym floor.  

11. Other children warned the staff member about the unsafe behavior, but she responded, “boys will be boys,” and took no corrective action.  

12. Shortly thereafter, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s son, an eight-year-old small in stature, causing him to fall and strike his head on the hardwood floor.  

13. A.J. lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and was later transported to the emergency department, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  

14. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$5,000** in reasonable and necessary medical expenses as a result of the injury.  

15. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s son experienced pain and suffering, emotional distress, missed several days of school, and continues to experience residual symptoms.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or operator of a child care or recreational facility owes a **duty of reasonable care** to protect invitees, particularly minor children, against foreseeable risks of harm. *See* **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331 (1983); **Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc.**, 355 Mass. 450, 452, 245 N.E.2d 420 (1969).  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff’s minor son a duty to provide reasonable supervision commensurate with the children’s age and the activities undertaken. *See* **Poydras v. City of Boston**, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 951 (1985); **Mosko v. Raytheon Co.**, 416 Mass. 395 (1993); **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (1965)**.  

19. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to provide adequate staff supervision in the gymnasium, permitting older children to engage in unsafe play, and ignoring prior warnings of foreseeable danger. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 699 (2000); **Yakubowicz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.**, 404 Mass. 624 (1989).  

20. Defendant’s acts and omissions were unreasonable under all the circumstances and constituted negligence. *See* **Foley v. Bos. Hous. Auth.**, 407 Mass. 640 (1990).  

21. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries suffered by Plaintiff’s minor son. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (foreseeability of harm and breach of duty sufficient for negligence claim).  

22. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s minor son suffered physical injury, pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, and Plaintiff incurred significant medical expenses. *See* **Mass. G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence), **G.L. c. 231, § 60F** (personal injury actions by minors).
