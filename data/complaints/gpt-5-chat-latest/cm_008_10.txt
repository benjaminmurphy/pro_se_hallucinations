**LINDSAY CARTER**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**JASON REYNOLDS**,  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter**, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody judgment entered on **April 15, 2022**, in the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court, regarding the minor child **Emily Carter (age 10)**. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Lindsay Carter**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother and primary residential parent of the minor child, **Emily Carter**.  
2. The Defendant, **Jason Reynolds**, also resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.  
3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable family law principles governing custody and visitation.

---

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On **April 15, 2022**, this Court entered a Judgment providing for **shared legal custody** of the parties’ minor child. The judgment designated the Plaintiff as the **primary residential parent**, with the Defendant entitled to **substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sundays**.  
5. The Judgment further required that the parties **cooperate regarding educational decisions** and keep one another informed about school-related matters.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. At the time the original custody judgment entered, the parties’ daughter, Emily, was maintaining satisfactory grades and school attendance.  
7. Since approximately early 2024, the Defendant has repeatedly failed to ensure that Emily attends school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, often keeping her home and describing her absences as "mental health days" without supporting medical documentation.  
8. These repeated absences have resulted in formal **truancy warnings** from the school administration.  
9. The child’s **grades and standardized test scores have declined measurably**, and teachers have expressed concern about her academic progress.  
10. The Defendant has also failed to bring Emily to scheduled **tutoring sessions** that occur during or following his parenting time.  
11. These actions directly undermine the child’s educational stability and welfare and are inconsistent with the terms and spirit of the existing custody order and **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31**, which prioritizes the child’s best interests.  
12. The pattern of missing school and noncompliance with agreed-upon educational responsibilities constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the 2022 Judgment.  

---

### IV. THE CHILD’S BEST INTERESTS WARRANT MODIFICATION

13. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31**, and under Massachusetts case law, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child.  
14. The Supreme Judicial Court in **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**, and **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**, held that the paramount consideration in all custody determinations is the best interest of the child.  
15. Where circumstances have deteriorated or a parent’s conduct impairs a child’s welfare, modification is warranted. See **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**; **Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998)**.  
16. The Massachusetts Appeals Court has recognized that consistent interference with a child’s schooling or routine may justify modification to protect the child’s educational welfare. See **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)**.  
17. Similarly, failure to support a child’s academic needs may demonstrate an inability to act jointly in the child’s best interests, justifying adjustment of legal or physical custody. See **Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996)**.  
18. Denial of educational attendance or routine has been viewed as "contrary to the child’s welfare" within meaning of **Hale v. Hale, 12 Mass. 190 (1981)**, and **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.  
19. The Court’s continuing equitable authority under **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6** and **M.G.L. c. 208, § 37** empowers it to revise custody and visitation provisions as justice and the welfare of the child may require.  
20. The Plaintiff’s request does not seek to deprive the Defendant of a meaningful relationship with the child but rather to ensure continuity of education and stability, both essential to the child’s best interests as noted in **Care and Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704 (1984)** and **Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)**.  
21. Accordingly, modification is appropriate to protect Emily’s educational welfare and support her emotional stability.

---

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

22. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court **modify the current judgment** to reflect one or more of the following remedies:  
   a. Grant the Plaintiff **final decision-making authority** within the scope of joint legal custody on all issues relating to education, including school attendance and tutoring; **or**,  
   b. Modify the parenting plan to eliminate the Defendant’s **Sunday overnight** so that Emily attends school from the Plaintiff’s residence on Monday mornings; and  
   c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the minor child.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the April 15, 2022 custody judgment;  
2. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff final authority with respect to school attendance decisions or, in the alternative, revise the parenting schedule to remove Sunday overnights from the Defendant’s parenting time;  
3. Order such additional relief as the Court deems just and proper to promote the child’s welfare and educational stability; and  
4. Schedule a hearing forthwith on this Complaint for Modification.
