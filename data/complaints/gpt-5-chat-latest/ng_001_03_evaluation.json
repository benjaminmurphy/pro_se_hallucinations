Ellard abolishes the traditional common\u2011law distinction between invitees and licensees and imposes on occupiers a general duty of reasonable care to all lawful entrants, rather than specifically recognizing a special \u201cbusiness invitee\u201d duty. The quoted passage is a concurrence criticizing residual reliance on trespasser status; it does not articulate or preserve a distinct invitee standard as stated in the proposition. Thus, the case does not support the proposition that defendant owed plaintiff, as a business invitee, a special invitee-based duty of care.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors."

However, in Oliveri there was no evidence that the defendant actually knew of the hazardous condition; the entire analysis concerns whether constructive notice (time on the stair) could be inferred, and the court ultimately holds the evidence insufficient and orders judgment for the defendant. Thus, the opinion does not support a proposition about breach based on actual knowledge and failure to clean or warn; it instead rejects liability on the facts presented.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Where a foreign substance on a floor or stairway causes the business visitor to fall and sustain injuries, he may prove the negligence of the defendant by proof that the defendant or his servant caused the substance to be there, or he may show that the defendant or his servants had actual knowledge of the existence of the foreign substance... In the more usual case, however, the plaintiff attempts to establish the defendant\u2019s negligence by showing that the foreign substance was present... for such a length of time that the defendant should have known about it.\""

It does not, however, deal with or articulate a rule about a defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of a spill or hazardous condition indoors, nor does it specifically address breach by \"failing to clean up the spill or post a warning sign\" despite such knowledge. The cited opinion therefore provides general premises-liability principles but does not establish the specific proposition about actual knowledge and failure to warn or clean up a spill.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "If a property owner knows or reasonably should know of a dangerous condition on its property, whether arising from an accumulation of snow or ice, or rust on a railing, or a discarded banana peel, the property owner owes a duty to lawful visitors to make reasonable efforts to protect lawful visitors against the danger."
