---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business as a restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.  
3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.  
4. Venue is proper in Norfolk County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Quincy, which lies within Norfolk County.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On September 10, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful patron and business invitee at the Quincy Bistro, located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  
6. While present, a restaurant server in the employ of Defendant accidentally dropped a serving tray carrying several water glasses, causing water, ice, and broken glass to spill onto the tile floor of a narrow hallway connecting the dining area and the restroom corridor.  
7. The server promptly removed the visible broken glass but failed to dry or mop the area or to place a “Wet Floor” caution sign or any other warning marker.  
8. The server stated to nearby staff and patrons that she would “be right back with a mop.”  
9. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose from her dining table to use the restroom.  
10. As Plaintiff walked through the same hallway, the tile floor remained wet from the earlier spill.  
11. The liquid on the floor was clear and difficult to discern, appearing as a reflective shine on the tile surface rather than an obvious puddle.  
12. Plaintiff stepped onto the wet area, her foot slipped out from under her, and she fell forcefully to the floor, twisting her right knee.  
13. Immediately after the fall, Plaintiff overheard employees remarking that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time and that it had not yet been cleaned.  
14. Plaintiff was taken to urgent care, where she was diagnosed with a sprained knee requiring a brace, rest, and physical therapy.  
15. As a result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered pain, physical impairment, and economic damages including medical expenses of approximately **$2,500** and lost wages of approximately **$1,200**.  
16. Plaintiff has complied with all pre-suit requirements and now brings this action to recover damages.

### III. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16.  
18. Defendant, as the owner and operator of Quincy Bistro, owed Plaintiff—as a lawful business invitee—a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any dangers of which it knew or reasonably should have known. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
19. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner must act as a reasonable person in the maintenance of property in view of the probability of injury to others. *See* **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988).  
20. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by:  
   a. Allowing water and ice to remain on the floor of a heavily used passageway;  
   b. Failing to post any warning or “wet floor” sign despite knowledge of the spill; and  
   c. Failing to dry, mop, or otherwise make the area safe within a reasonable time after the hazard arose.  
21. Defendant’s employees had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition. *See* **Oliveri v. MBTA**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973) (liability where owner knew or should have known of foreign substance on floor).  
22. The foreseeability of harm under these circumstances is clear, as slip-and-fall injuries from wet floors are a common and well-understood danger. *See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
23. Defendant’s failure to remedy the dangerous condition or to warn of it constituted unreasonable conduct falling below the standard of care required of proprietors. *See* **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007).  
24. Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety at all times. *See* **Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.**, 388 Mass. 342 (1983).  
25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, physical pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost income. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
26. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s breach of duty. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006).  
27. Defendant is liable for the negligent acts of its employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior. *See* **Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.**, 438 Mass. 317 (2002).  
28. The Massachusetts comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, governs apportionment of fault, but Plaintiff denies any comparative fault herein.  
29. Plaintiff suffered damages as recognized under Massachusetts law, including physical pain and suffering, lost wages, and medical expenses. *See* **FMR Corp. v. Boston Edison Co.**, 415 Mass. 393 (1993).

### IV. DAMAGES

30. Plaintiff’s medical expenses, including urgent care, knee brace, and physical therapy, total approximately $2,500.  
31. Plaintiff also suffered approximately $1,200 in lost wages from missed work.  
32. Plaintiff continues to experience discomfort and intermittent pain in her knee.  
33. Plaintiff seeks fair compensation for pain, suffering, medical costs, lost income, and all other lawful damages.
