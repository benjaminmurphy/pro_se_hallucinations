Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and related authorities)

---

#### I. INTRODUCTION

The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, respectfully brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, seeking modification of the existing custody judgment entered by the Bristol Probate and Family Court on **June 15, 2022**. Since the entry of that judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children, **Liam Thompson** (age 10) and **Emma Thompson** (age 8), warranting modification of both the custodial arrangement and the provisions governing parental decision-making and communication.

---

#### II. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, of [Plaintiff’s current address], is the mother of the minor children, Liam and Emma.  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Thompson, of [Defendant’s current address], is the father of the minor children.

---

#### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60(b)**, as the original custody judgment was entered by this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the **Bristol Probate and Family Court**, as both parents and the minor children reside within the Commonwealth and the original custody order was issued by this division.

---

#### IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5. On **June 15, 2022**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time providing for **shared legal custody** between the parties, with the children primarily residing with the Plaintiff and having parenting time with the Defendant on alternating weekends.

6. The judgment required both parties to foster the children’s relationship with the other parent and to refrain from making disparaging remarks concerning the other parent in the presence of the children.

---

#### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the Judgment, the Defendant has routinely enrolled the children in extracurricular activities, lessons, and events that occur during Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time without first consulting or obtaining agreement from the Plaintiff, in violation of the joint-decision-making provisions of the existing order.

8. The Defendant has repeatedly told the children that it is their mother’s “fault” when they cannot attend certain activities during weekends in her custody, creating conflict and emotional distress for the children.

9. The minor children have reported that their father has referred to their mother as “selfish” and claimed she “does not really love them,” directly undermining the other parent’s relationship with the children in violation of the prior judgment’s non‑disparagement requirement.

10. The younger child, Emma, has begun experiencing stomach aches and increased anxiety on transition days, suggestive of stress resulting from the ongoing parental conflict.

11. These circumstances constitute a **material and substantial change** affecting the children’s emotional well-being and stability, making modification necessary in their best interests under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**.

---

#### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

12. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a prior custody order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and upon a determination that modification is in the best interests of the children.  

13. The standard of the child’s **best interests** governs all custody determinations. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

14. Modification is warranted where changed circumstances substantially affect the welfare of the children. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

15. The Court must consider whether continued shared custody conflicts with the children’s emotional and psychological interests. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Hale v. Hale*, 394 Mass. 389 (1985).

16. A parent’s failure to communicate and cooperate over major decisions undermines the viability of shared legal custody. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

17. Conduct by one parent disparaging the other parent to the children is inconsistent with promoting the children’s best interests. *Rosenberg v. Rosenberg*, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (1992); *Mancuso v. Mancuso*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 973 (1981).

18. The Court has discretion to impose modifications to clarify scheduling and communication to mitigate future parental conflict. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); *Henshaw v. Henshaw*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 737 (1987).

19. Collectively, the evidence demonstrates that continued shared legal custody, as presently defined, is no longer workable and adversely impacts the children’s welfare.

#### VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the June 15, 2022 Judgment sufficient to warrant modification under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**;

B. **Modify custody** to provide that the Plaintiff shall have **sole physical custody** and **primary legal decision‑making authority** regarding the children’s health, education, and activities, subject to reasonable consultation with the Defendant;

C. **Establish a defined parenting schedule** for the Defendant that minimizes transition‑related stress on the children and creates clear rules governing extracurricular scheduling and parental communication;

D. **Reaffirm and strengthen the non‑disparagement provisions**, with language prohibiting any derogatory or undermining statements about the other parent in the presence of the children;

E. **Order that** the parties exchange all scheduling and activity information at least fourteen (14) days in advance, unless otherwise mutually agreed;

F. **Grant such other and further relief** as this Honorable Court deems just and proper in the circumstances, including mediation or co‑parenting counseling if appropriate.
