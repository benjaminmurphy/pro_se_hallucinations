#### I. INTRODUCTION

1. The Plaintiff, **Laura Smith**, respectfully brings this Complaint for Modification seeking amendment of the existing custody and parenting-time order entered by this Honorable Court on **August 15, 2019**.

The Plaintiff moves this Court pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, **c. 209C, § 20**, and the Court’s equitable powers under **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, to modify said Judgment on the grounds that a substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred affecting the welfare of the minor child, **Emily Johnson (age 8)**.

#### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

7. Jurisdiction and venue properly lie with this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, granting the Probate and Family Court continuing jurisdiction over custody modifications where an initial judgment was entered by this Court.  

8. This Court has continuing authority to modify prior custody orders upon proof of a “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” and where such modification is in the best interests of the child.

#### IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9. On **August 15, 2019**, the Barnstable Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment establishing primary physical custody with the Plaintiff, **Laura Smith**, and parenting time for **Michael Johnson** consisting of every other weekend and one midweek overnight, each Wednesday.  

10. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, both parties resided in the same town. The Wednesday overnight was designed to facilitate frequent contact between father and daughter without disrupting school attendance, as the father’s residence was within five minutes of the child’s school.  

11. In or around **2023**, the Defendant relocated approximately **ninety (90) miles** away to **Cape Cod, Massachusetts**.  

12. Despite the relocation, the Defendant insists on exercising the Wednesday overnight, necessitating a 180‑mile round‑trip on a school night.  

13. This schedule requires that Emily leave for school at approximately **4:30 A.M. on Thursday mornings**, resulting in substantial sleep deprivation and fatigue.  

14. The child’s teacher has reported diminished participation and attentiveness in class on Thursdays directly correlated with the overnight travel to Cape Cod.  

15. The Plaintiff has made good‑faith efforts to resolve this issue informally with the Defendant, but he has refused to adjust his midweek parenting schedule.  

16. The long commute and resulting exhaustion have created an adverse impact on the child’s well‑being and academic performance, constituting a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the original order.  

17. Modification is therefore necessary to serve Emily’s best interests and promote her stability, academic success, and overall welfare.

#### V. APPLICABLE LAW AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITIES

18. A Probate and Family Court may modify provisions of a custody or parenting‑time order where “a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” has occurred and the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. **G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.**

19. The court’s paramount consideration is always the child’s best interests. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

20. Massachusetts appellate decisions have consistently found that significant relocation or a change in the practical feasibility of a parenting schedule may constitute a material change warranting modification. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016).

21. The child’s welfare and the avoidance of undue travel burden are vital considerations in parenting‑time orders. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).

22. A court may properly modify midweek visitation where the parent’s relocation imposes excessive travel on a school‑age child. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

23. Where the existing order impairs a child’s academic functioning or emotional health, modification is warranted. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).

24. The Court’s duty is to promote stability and continuity for the minor child. *Miller v. Miller*, 478 Mass. 642 (2018); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Adoption of Ilona*, 459 Mass. 53 (2011).

25. Taken together, the relocation of the Defendant, the resulting excessive travel time, the ongoing exhaustion of the child, and the negative effects reported by the school materially alter the child’s circumstances and compel modification under these statutes and precedents.

#### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

26. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. **Eliminate the Wednesday overnight** from the current parenting schedule, substituting instead an after‑school visit or phone call/video call to maintain contact without disrupting school attendance;  

   b. Adjust the Defendant’s **weekend parenting time** as necessary to ensure continuity and stability for Emily, such as extending weekend pick‑up or drop‑off times to balance total parenting time;  

   c. Order that each parent shall ensure the child’s school attendance, adequate rest, and reasonable travel arrangements consistent with her best interests; and  

   d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

#### VII. CONCLUSION

27. Since entry of the 2019 custody order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances**—namely, the Defendant’s relocation to Cape Cod and the resulting travel‑related hardship—that has significantly impacted the child’s welfare.  

28. The requested modification is in the **best interests of Emily Johnson**, ensuring her health, academic well‑being, and emotional stability.

---

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, **Laura Smith**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court issue a Judgment modifying the August 15, 2019 custody order as set forth above, together with such other relief as is just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.
