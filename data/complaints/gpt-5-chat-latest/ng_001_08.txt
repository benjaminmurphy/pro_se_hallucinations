### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), by way of complaint against Defendant Somerville Grocery Store, Inc. (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff **Emily Carter** is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant **Somerville Grocery Store, Inc.** is a Massachusetts corporation doing business at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, MA 02143.  
3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2**, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Somerville, Middlesex County, and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court Department.  

---

## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

4. On or about **September 16, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and business invitee shopping at Defendant’s grocery store located at **123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts**.  
5. While walking in the **dairy aisle**, Plaintiff encountered a **large puddle of spilled milk**.  
6. The spilled milk was clearly visible and appeared to have been present for some time, as reflected by **cart tracks** running through it.  
7. Defendant had **no warning cones, wet floor signs, or other safety measures** in place to alert customers to the hazard.  
8. A store employee was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet away and, upon approaching Plaintiff after her fall, admitted that he had seen the spill “a few minutes ago” but had delayed cleaning it up.  
9. Plaintiff stepped into the puddle, slipped, and fell hard onto her **right hip**.  
10. Plaintiff initially attempted to continue shopping but later that evening developed **significant pain**.  
11. The following day, Plaintiff sought treatment at **urgent care**, where she was diagnosed with a **hip sprain** and prescribed physical therapy.  
12. Plaintiff underwent physical therapy and required multiple treatment sessions.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,200** in medical expenses and experienced lost wages totaling **$800** from missed workdays at her job in a local café.  
14. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain and residual discomfort from the injury.  
15. The hazardous condition was created and/or permitted to persist by Defendant’s agents, servants, or employees, and Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition for invitees.  

---

## III. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE  

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition and to warn of dangers of which it knew or reasonably should have known.  
18. The existence of such duty is well-established under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing distinctions between invitees and licensees and recognizing duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).  
19. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk;  
   b. Failing to post warning signs or otherwise warn customers; and  
   c. Failing to properly train employees to address and remove hazards in a timely manner.  
20. The breach of this duty constitutes negligence pursuant to **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343**, adopted in Massachusetts.  
21. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

---

## IV. LEGAL AUTHORITY SUPPORTING NEGLIGENCE CLAIM  

22. Under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 231, § 85**, a plaintiff injured by reason of another’s negligence may recover damages reduced only by her own comparative fault, if any.  
23. Property owners and occupiers owe a duty of reasonable care to maintain safe premises. See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).  
24. A defendant is liable where it knew or should have known of a hazardous condition and failed to act within a reasonable time. See **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007); **Thurlow v. Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc.**, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 175 (2000).  
25. Constructive notice of a dangerous condition may be inferred when the hazard existed for an appreciable time or was identifiable upon reasonable inspection. See **Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.**, 332 Mass. 560 (1955); **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263 (1961).  
26. A store employee’s knowledge of a spill is imputable to the store. See **Vaisbord v. Boston Edison Co.**, 304 Mass. 60 (1939); **Colbert v. Ricker**, 314 Mass. 138 (1943).  
27. Defendant’s failure to act despite awareness of the spill constitutes clear breach of duty under **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343** and **§ 343A**, as applied in **Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc.**, 418 Mass. 590 (1994).  
28. Plaintiff’s injuries are within the foreseeable risks created by Defendant’s failure to maintain safe premises. See **Whittaker v. Saraceno**, 418 Mass. 196 (1994).  
29. Accordingly, Defendant is liable in negligence for Plaintiff’s damages.  

---

## V. DAMAGES  

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained and continues to suffer:  
   a. Bodily injury, including a hip sprain;  
   b. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately **$1,200**;  
   c. Lost wages of approximately **$800**;  
   d. Pain and suffering; and  
   e. Interference with daily activities and diminished enjoyment of life.  

---

## VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Somerville Grocery Store, Inc.**;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but believed to exceed **$2,000**, plus interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. Award costs of suit and any other relief this Court deems just and proper; and  
D. Grant Plaintiff such further and additional relief as equity and justice may require.  

---

## VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
