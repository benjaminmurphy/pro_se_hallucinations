Defendant.

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

#### **I. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Emily Carter**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 28** and related authorities, seeking a modification of the existing custody order entered by this Court on **May 10, 2021**, in the matter of custody and parenting time concerning the minor child, **Jacob Carter**, born [DOB omitted for privacy purposes].  

This Complaint is brought on the grounds that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the prior order, and modification is necessary to protect the best interests and welfare of the child.

#### **II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Emily Carter  
   Residence: [Confidential – filed separately if required under Standing Order 1-83]  
   Contact: (617) 555‑0123 / psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Carter  
   Residence: [Address on record].  

3. **Minor Child:** Jacob Carter, age 8.

---

#### **III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, granting the Probate and Family Court continuing authority to modify custody orders when the welfare of the child so requires.  
5. Venue is proper in **Middlesex County** because the original custody order was issued by this Court, and the minor child resides primarily within its jurisdiction.

---

#### **IV. PRIOR ORDER**

6. On **May 10, 2021**, this Court entered a final order granting **shared legal custody** of Jacob Carter to both parents, with **primary physical custody** to the Plaintiff and **weekend parenting time** awarded to the Defendant.  
7. That order was based upon findings that both parties were then stable, capable of cooperative co‑parenting, and able to provide a safe and supportive environment for the child.

---

#### **V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the May 10, 2021 order, circumstances have materially changed within the meaning of **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and relevant caselaw, including but not limited to *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
9. The minor child, Jacob, now reports troubling conditions during weekend visits with the Defendant, including exposure to “special drinks,” observed intoxication, and impaired supervision.  
10. A neighbor recently provided a video showing the Defendant physically stumbling while removing the minor child from a vehicle late at night.  
11. The child’s school has notified the Plaintiff of repeated Monday morning fatigue and behavioral signs consistent with inadequate sleep and possible emotional stress following weekend visits.  
12. These developments represent a **substantial and material change** in the Defendant’s ability to safely care for the child during unsupervised overnight visits.  
13. The environment described poses a **risk to the welfare and development of the child**, satisfying the “changed circumstances” requirement set out in *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Adoption of Vito*, 431 Mass. 550 (2000); and *Care & Protection of Georgette*, 439 Mass. 28 (2003).  
14. Modification is therefore necessary and proper to ensure the continued safety, stability, and emotional well‑being of the minor child.

#### **VI. LEGAL STANDARD**

15. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may revise and alter prior judgments “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”  
16. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (holding a material change in circumstances warrants modification of custody or support orders); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (modification appropriate when substantial changes affect the child’s best interests).  
17. The guiding principle under Massachusetts law remains the **best interests of the child**, a standard articulated in *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976), and reaffirmed in *Custody of Kali*, supra.  
18. Factors bearing upon the child’s best interests include safety, stability, parental fitness, consistency of care, and the child’s emotional and physical needs.  
19. The Court has broad equitable powers under **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6** to enter such orders as justice and equity may require to safeguard a child’s welfare.

#### **VII. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Emily Carter**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior custody judgment;  
B. **Modify** the May 10, 2021 custody order to provide that the Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised or otherwise conditioned** to ensure the child’s safety and welfare, including any restrictions the Court deems appropriate (e.g., prohibition on alcohol use during visits, limitations on overnights until further review);  
C. **Affirm** that the Plaintiff shall retain primary physical custody and joint or sole legal custody as the Court finds is in the minor child’s best interests;  
D. **Order** such further evaluations, investigations, or services as may assist the Court in determining the child’s best interests (e.g., Guardian ad Litem appointment, parental fitness evaluation); and  
E. **Grant** such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
