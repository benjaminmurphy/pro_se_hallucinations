**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about **September 10, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully operating his bicycle in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff was traveling safely and in compliance with all applicable traffic laws and regulations, wearing a helmet, and proceeding with due care.  
7. At or near **418 Commonwealth Avenue**, a rideshare vehicle operated by an employee, servant, and/or agent of Defendant was stopped in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  
8. Without warning and without first checking for oncoming cyclists or other traffic, the rideshare driver suddenly swung open his driver-side door directly into the bike lane.  
9. At that instant, Plaintiff’s bicycle collided with the open door, causing him to be thrown to the pavement.  
10. As a direct and foreseeable result, Plaintiff sustained **road rash on his arms and legs**, a **chipped front tooth**, and **damage to his bicycle frame**.  
11. At the scene, the driver admitted he “didn’t see” the Plaintiff because he was “checking his phone.”  
12. Plaintiff exercised reasonable care at all relevant times.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$1,500 in medical and dental expenses** and approximately **$600 in lost wages**, as well as property damage, pain, suffering, and inconvenience.  
14. The driver’s acts and omissions occurred within the scope of his employment with Defendant and in furtherance of Defendant’s business.  
15. Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligence of its employee or agent pursuant to the doctrine of **respondeat superior**.

**COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**  

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, every person owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 147 (2006); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  
18. Defendant, through its employee, owed Plaintiff a duty to operate and manage the rideshare vehicle in a safe and lawful manner, including taking reasonable precautions before opening a car door into an active bike lane. *See* G.L. c. 90, § 14 (prohibiting opening a vehicle door unless it is safe to do so).  
19. The driver breached this duty by failing to check his surroundings, opening the door without warning, and diverting his attention to his phone. *See* **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37, 45 (2009) (negligence consists of failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances).  
20. The actions of the driver constituted negligence per se under G.L. c. 90, § 14, and that negligence is imputed to Defendant. *See* **Benn v. Board of Registration in Medicine**, 437 Mass. 382 (2002).  
21. It was foreseeable that opening a car door into a public bike lane without checking for traffic could cause serious bodily injury to cyclists. *See* **Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston**, 365 Mass. 320, 326 (1974).  
22. Defendant also had a duty to properly hire, train, and supervise its drivers to ensure compliance with traffic and safety laws. *See* **Foley v. Boston Hous. Auth.**, 400 Mass. 640, 646 (1987).  
23. Defendant breached that duty by failing to ensure that its drivers followed safe unloading and door-opening procedures, by failing to train drivers on bicycle safety awareness, and by tolerating distracted driving while engaged through its platform. *See* **Coombes v. Florio**, 450 Mass. 182, 190 (2007).  
24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence and the negligence of its agent, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, pain, mental anguish, monetary loss, and property damage. *See* **Matsuyama v. Birnbaum**, 452 Mass. 1, 6–7 (2008); **Carey v. New England Organ Bank**, 446 Mass. 270 (2006).  
25. Plaintiff has incurred and will continue to incur out-of-pocket expenses for medical treatment, dental care, and bicycle replacement, along with lost wages and other damages. *See* **Kelly v. Rossi**, 395 Mass. 659 (1985); **Kaminski v. Teverow**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 768 (2001).

   b. Lost wages: approximately **$600**  
   c. Property damage to bicycle
