### COMPLAINT

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Jane Doe**, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, **ABC Realty Management**, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, Lynn, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant ABC Realty Management (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts property management company with its principal place of business in Essex County, Massachusetts.  
3. The events giving rise to this action occurred in Lynn, in Essex County, Massachusetts.  
4. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, because the cause of action arose in Lynn, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business there.  

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, and controlled the apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts (“the Premises”).  
7. Plaintiff resided on the third floor of the Premises.  
8. Defendant, as landlord and property manager, was responsible for maintaining the common areas and ensuring that smoke detectors in hallways were operable and properly maintained, as required by **G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E and 26F**, and **527 C.M.R. 1.00** (Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code).  
9. For several months before September 15, 2023, the smoke detector in the common hallway immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment emitted a low battery “chirping” sound, indicating the battery was nearly depleted.  
10. Eventually, an unidentified person removed the detector’s battery and left it on a nearby windowsill, rendering the alarm inoperative.  
11. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the nonfunctioning smoke detector on at least three occasions over the course of those months.  
12. Each time, Defendant stated it would “take care of it” but took no corrective action.  
13. On or about **September 15, 2023**, a fire broke out in a first-floor unit of the Premises, reportedly originating in that tenant’s kitchen.  
14. Because the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit had no battery, there was no alarm or warning of smoke or fire to residents on the upper floors.  
15. Plaintiff only noticed the fire when smoke seeped into her apartment. By then, the common hallway was filled with thick smoke, seriously endangering her ability to evacuate.  
16. Plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation, respiratory distress, and emotional trauma and was hospitalized overnight for treatment.  
17. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$7,500** in medical expenses and approximately **$2,000** in lost wages due to missed work.  
18. Plaintiff also suffered property damage to clothing, furniture, and personal belongings due to smoke and water exposure.  
19. Defendant’s failure to maintain the smoke detector created an unreasonable risk of harm to tenants and was the direct and foreseeable cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.  
20. All damages suffered by Plaintiff were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

---

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully set forth herein.  
22. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain the common areas of the apartment building, including ensuring that smoke detectors were installed and functioning as required by law.  
23. A landlord in Massachusetts must act with reasonable care to maintain common areas in a safe condition for tenants and lawful visitors. **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
24. Defendant breached this duty by failing to inspect, maintain, and repair the smoke detector after repeated notice of its inoperative condition.  
25. Defendant’s duty of care arises from both common law and statute, including but not limited to **G.L. c. 186, § 15**, **G.L. c. 143, § 3T**, and the Massachusetts State Fire Code, which collectively require landlords to ensure that required fire protection systems are functional.  
26. Under **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343**, adopted in Massachusetts (see **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013)), a possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to invitees by a condition on the land if the possessor knows or should know of the condition and should realize it involves an unreasonable risk of harm.  
27. Defendant had actual notice of the nonfunctioning smoke detector through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints.  
28. Defendant also had constructive notice through the ongoing “chirping” alarm that directly indicated battery failure.  
29. Defendant’s failure to repair or replace the battery within a reasonable time constituted a breach of its duty under Massachusetts negligence law, including **Banaghan v. Dewey**, 340 Mass. 73 (1959) (landlord liable for failure to maintain common areas in safe condition); **King v. G & M Realty Corp.**, 373 Mass. 658 (1977); **Foster v. The Loft, Inc.**, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 289 (1988).  
30. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as recognized under **Bernier v. Boston Edison Co.**, 380 Mass. 372 (1980) (defendant liable for harm that was reasonably foreseeable result of its conduct).  
31. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable and preventable had Defendant exercised ordinary care. **Yee v. American National Ins. Co.**, 353 Mass. 358 (1967).  
32. Plaintiff’s status as a residential tenant places her squarely within the class of persons the statutory duties were intended to protect. **LeBlanc v. Logan Hilton Joint Venture**, 463 Mass. 316 (2012).  
33. Defendant’s inaction also breached its implied warranty of habitability and duty to maintain safe premises recognized in **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).  
34. As a result, Plaintiff sustained personal injury, property damage, and associated economic losses.  
35. Defendant’s misconduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law, entitling Plaintiff to compensatory damages.

### IV. DAMAGES

36. Plaintiff suffered the following damages as a direct result of Defendant’s negligence:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately **$7,500**;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately **$2,000**;  
   c. Property damage to personal belongings, estimated at **$3,000**;  
   d. Physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience.  
37. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the amount of damages as further information becomes available.

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for negligence;  
B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$12,500**, plus interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
C. Award costs of suit pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**.

---

### VII. CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO MASS. R. CIV. P. 11

I, the undersigned Plaintiff, certify that I have read the foregoing Complaint and that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, it is well‑grounded in fact and warranted by existing law or a good‑faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.
