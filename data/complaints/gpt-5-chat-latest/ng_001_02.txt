### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

**Plaintiff, Emily Johnson,** by and for herself, brings this Complaint against **Defendant, Whole Foods Market, Inc.**, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a customer lawfully upon Defendant’s premises located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, **Whole Foods Market, Inc.**, is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with a principal place of business in Massachusetts and operating a grocery store at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (hereinafter “the Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, as the damages claimed do not exceed the jurisdictional threshold for the District Court.

4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, §§ 2, 8**, as the Defendant operates its business within this judicial district and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred here.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On **September 16, 2023**, Plaintiff was shopping in the dairy aisle at Defendant’s store located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

6. While walking through the aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk on the floor.

7. The puddle was readily visible and had cart tracks passing through it, indicating that the hazardous condition had existed for some time prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

8. There were no warning signs, cones, or other barriers alerting customers to the presence of the spill.

9. An employee of Defendant was present in the area, approximately fifteen feet away, stocking shelves.

10. After Plaintiff fell, the employee approached and stated that he had noticed the spill "a few minutes ago" but was finishing his stocking duties before retrieving cleaning supplies.

11. Plaintiff experienced immediate discomfort but initially believed the injury to be minor and completed her shopping.

12. That evening, Plaintiff experienced significant pain in her left hip and sought medical care at an urgent care clinic the following day.

13. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a **hip sprain** and underwent physical therapy as part of her recovery.

14. As a result of the injury, Plaintiff missed several shifts at her job at a local café, incurring lost wages and medical expenses exceeding $3,500.  

15. Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety and did not contribute to the creation of the hazardous condition.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition for lawful business invitees such as Plaintiff.  
   *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).

18. Defendant further had a duty to inspect, remedy, or warn invitees of any dangerous conditions of which it knew or should have known.  
   *See* **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 372 (2010).

19. Defendant, by its employees and agents, breached this duty by failing to remedy or warn of a known puddle of spilled milk despite actual knowledge of its existence.  
   *See* **Lanagan v. Jordan Marsh Co.**, 324 Mass. 540, 541–42 (1949).

20. Defendant’s employee’s acknowledgment that he “had noticed the spill a few minutes ago” constitutes evidence of actual notice.  
   *Cf.* **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263, 264 (1961).

21. Alternatively, the condition existed for such a length of time that Defendant should have discovered and corrected it through reasonable inspection, thereby establishing constructive notice.  
   *See* **Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co.**, 208 Mass. 273, 274–75 (1911).

22. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes a breach of its duty to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition in violation of Massachusetts common law.  
   *See also* **Mulloy v. Kay Jewelry Co.**, 285 Mass. 264, 266 (1934); **Batchelder v. Realty Co.**, 281 Mass. 545, 550 (1933).

23. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries.  
   *See* **Janosz v. Berman**, 355 Mass. 279, 283 (1969).

24. Plaintiff suffered physical injury, medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and diminished enjoyment of life as a direct result of Defendant’s conduct.

25. Plaintiff’s damages were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligence.  
   *See* **Abramian v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll.**, 432 Mass. 107, 115 (2000).

---

### V. DAMAGES

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained:

   a. Medical expenses of approximately **$2,000**;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately **$1,500**;  
   c. Pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life;  
   d. All damages permitted by law, including interest and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Whole Foods Market, Inc.**;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury but reasonably estimated to exceed **$3,500**;  
C. Award statutory interest and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**.

---

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
