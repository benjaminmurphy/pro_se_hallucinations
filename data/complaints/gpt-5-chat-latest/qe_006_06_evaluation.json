The court analyzes a broader pattern of noise, dust, access issues, and some temporary utility interruptions, and treats them collectively as substantial interference/nuisance, not as a standalone utilities-based breach.

While the opinion does not use the exact phrase \u201cfailure to act within a reasonable time after notice,\u201d its reasoning rests on the landlord\u2019s prolonged failure to correct the problem after it arose and was known, and on the tenant\u2019s right to vacate within a reasonable time, which the court found he did.
