Thus it is consistent with, but not clear authority for, the universal statement in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The judge found that the tenants were \"very substantially deprived\" of quiet enjoyment of their leased premises \"for a substantial time\" (emphasis original). He ruled that the tenants\u2019 implied warranty of quiet enjoyment was violated by late evening and early morning music and disturbances coming from nearby premises which the landlords leased to others for use as a bar or cocktail lounge (lounge). The landlords argue that they did not violate the tenants\u2019 implied covenant of quiet enjoyment because they are not chargeable with the noise from the lounge."

Nowhere does the court discuss or imply that a covenant of quiet enjoyment is included in every residential lease or any lease at all. Therefore, this case cannot be proper authority for the stated proposition.",

In order to consider whether Mr. Singer\u2019s conduct constituted fraud on the court, we first determine if he was required to disclose the existence of the contingent fee agreement."

It further holds that Gem is liable because it violated its duty to maintain sanitary conditions and thereby permitted repeated flooding that interfered with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment. This aligns with the proposition that a breach occurs when the landlord\u2019s actions or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the premises, including through conditions caused by persons ostensibly beyond the landlord\u2019s control but within its legal responsibility.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 \u2026 Although early cases applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment required intent on the part of the landlord\u2026 more recent decisions have imposed liability whenever the \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of a landlord\u2019s action was interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights\u2026 Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

It does not discuss any requirement of intent, negligence, or foreseeability as elements of liability; rather, liability turns on status as tenant at sufferance and control/detaining of the premises under the statute. Thus, it does not support the proposition that negligent or foreseeable interference (as opposed to intentional conduct) is sufficient for landlord liability in a tort or interference context.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe basis of liability for use and occupation consists in the control over the premises which effectively deprives the new owner of the use of the property. \u2026 In our opinion the judge warrantably concluded from the auditor\u2019s report that Save-Mor\u2019s permission to Smith to use the area of the second floor \u2026 was an exercise of dominion over its use and constituted a detaining of the area by Save-Mor within the meaning of the statute.\u201d"

The court\u2019s discussion of breach of quiet enjoyment is framed around the landlord permitting criminal activity by third parties to continue, not around construction-related disturbances. Therefore, this opinion does not provide authority for the proposition that sustained construction noise, vibrations, and dust under the landlord\u2019s control constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn this case, we have no doubt that, if the plaintiffs truly are unable to use the common areas of the development, including sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and recreation areas within it, then the situation constitutes a serious interference with their quiet enjoyment and substantially impairs the character of the leased premises. \u2026 If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

It does not address noise, vibrations, dust, construction activities, or what constitutes substantial interference from such conditions. Therefore it provides no authority on the proposition concerning sustained construction-related disturbances under a landlord\u2019s control.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

The discussion of damages focuses on warranty-of-habitability and c. 93A theories, not on what kinds of disturbances render premises unsuitable under the covenant.

The court focuses on whether the landlord\u2019s acts (and failure to remedy conditions) materially deprived the tenant of use and enjoyment, but says nothing about permissible or reasonable hours of construction or renovation. Thus it supports the broader principle that serious interference with habitability can amount to constructive eviction, but not the specific proposition about renovation hours violating a covenant.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe defence of eviction, actual or constructive, is based upon a failure of consideration, or a breach, whether of commission or omission, of a covenant of the lease so material as to excuse the tenant from performing. \u2026 [I]f the landlord\u2019s acts necessarily deprive the tenant permanently or for a substantial time of the enjoyment of the property it can hardly be material with what intention the landlord acts.\u201d"
