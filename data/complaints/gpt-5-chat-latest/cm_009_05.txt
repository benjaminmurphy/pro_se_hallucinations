### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Lane**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, seeking a modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2019**, in this Court. The Plaintiff asserts that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the prior judgment and that modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the minor child**, **Sophia Lane (age 8)**.

---

**II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Lane, residing in Barnstable County, Massachusetts.  
   Contact information: (617) 555‑0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** Mark Lane, residing on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, **Sophia Lane**, born [date intentionally omitted], age eight.

---

**III. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER**

4. On **May 15, 2019**, this Court issued a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** awarding the Plaintiff primary physical custody and the Defendant parenting time consisting of **every other weekend** and **one midweek overnight on Wednesdays**.

5. At the time of the 2019 judgment, both parties resided in the same town, approximately five minutes apart, which made the midweek overnight practical and in Sophia’s best interests.

---

**IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. Since entry of the prior order, the Defendant has **moved approximately ninety (90) miles away** to Cape Cod.  

7. Despite the significant relocation, the Defendant continues to exercise the Wednesday overnight, which involves:  
   a. Picking Sophia up after school on Wednesdays;  
   b. Driving approximately ninety miles to Cape Cod;  
   c. Waking Sophia at approximately 4:30 A.M. on Thursdays; and  
   d. Driving her back ninety miles to attend school.  

8. Sophia has become **chronically exhausted**, demonstrating **noticeable declines in participation and attentiveness on Thursdays**, according to her teacher and school staff.  

9. The midweek commute has caused **educational disruption, sleep deprivation, and stress**, conditions incompatible with Sophia’s well-being and stability.  

10. The Defendant’s relocation and insistence on maintaining the midweek overnight constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** within the meaning of **Massachusetts law**.

---

**V. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION**

11. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, “[a] judgment relative to custody or visitation may be modified if the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  

12. The Court retains continuing jurisdiction over custody orders under **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31**, and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60**.  

13. In determining whether modification is warranted, the Court must consider the **best interests of the child**, as articulated in **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**, and **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.  

14. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that **a parent’s relocation** and its impact on the child’s schedule, education, and welfare may constitute a **material change of circumstances**. See:  
   - **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**;  
   - **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**;  
   - **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**;  
   - **Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015)**.  

15. The modification sought herein is not punitive but intended to serve Sophia’s best interests by reducing unnecessary travel and ensuring her continuity of rest, education, and emotional stability.  

16. The standard articulated in **Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**—requiring a showing that the modification serves the child’s best interests in light of changed circumstances—is satisfied by the facts above.  

17. The Court is further guided by:  
   - **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)** (best interests assessment focuses on child’s welfare and stability);  
   - **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)** (geographical changes and disruptions to schooling constitute material change);  
   - **Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)** (paramount concern is child’s best interests); and  
   - **G.L. c. 208, § 31A** (requiring consideration of a child’s welfare in light of parental residence and stability).

---

**VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

18. The Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:  
   a. **Eliminate the midweek Wednesday overnight** in the current parenting schedule;  
   b. **Preserve the Defendant’s alternating weekend parenting time** (Friday after school through Sunday evening); and  
   c. **Consider any reasonable adjustment** to ensure continued meaningful contact between Sophia and the Defendant consistent with her educational and emotional well-being.

19. The requested modification aligns with the **best interests of the minor child**, fosters stability, and prevents the ongoing negative effects of excessive travel on school nights.

---

**VII. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Lane**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior custody order issued May 15, 2019;  
2. Modify said order by **eliminating the Defendant’s midweek overnight parenting time**;  
3. Adjust the Defendant’s **weekend parenting time** as necessary to maintain a stable and beneficial parenting relationship;  
4. Grant such **further relief as justice and equity may require**.
