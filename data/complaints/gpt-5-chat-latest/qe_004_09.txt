### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14)

**Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”)**, for her complaint against **Defendant Michael Smith (“Defendant”)**, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson resides at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.  
2. Defendant Michael Smith is an individual and the landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.  
3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 223, § 2**, as the events giving rise to this complaint occurred within Worcester County and the rental property is located within the Worcester District Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  
4. This action arises under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which provides a statutory cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at **123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605**, at a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent as required and has performed her obligations as tenant.  
7. In or around **September 2025**, Plaintiff began observing pervasive evidence of rodent infestation in her apartment, including mouse droppings on kitchen counters, floors, and pantry areas.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation and requested remedial action.  
9. Defendant placed a few traps in response, capturing only two mice; however, the infestation persisted with continued droppings appearing on a near-weekly basis.  
10. Defendant stated that the problem was “normal for older buildings” and attributed it to Plaintiff’s housekeeping, which was and remains clean and sanitary.  
11. Defendant hired an exterminator once, but only for a single visit. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building required a more comprehensive treatment plan to address the infestation effectively.  
12. Defendant refused further pest control measures, citing cost, and took no additional steps to eradicate the infestation.  
13. As a result of the infestation, Plaintiff was forced to discard approximately **$200** worth of contaminated food and to purchase **$80** worth of sealed plastic storage containers to prevent further contamination.  
14. Plaintiff experiences ongoing anxiety and distress due to the unremedied mouse infestation and is unable to use her kitchen with comfort and safety.  
15. The condition substantially interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her premises as a dwelling.  
16. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises free from infestation and his refusal to take adequate corrective action violate the **covenant of quiet enjoyment** implied in all Massachusetts tenancies.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
19. Defendant’s failure to abate the persistent rodent infestation constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her leased premises.  
20. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have repeatedly held that the presence of vermin, unsanitary conditions, or persistent defects that impair the tenant’s ability to use the premises are violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
   - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord liable for failure to correct conditions interfering with tenant’s enjoyment).  
   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (duty includes preventing conditions rendering premises uninhabitable).  
   - **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (substantial interference need not be willful if caused by landlord’s acts or omissions).  
   - **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment breached by failure to address hazardous living conditions).  
   - **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (citing G.L. c. 186, § 14; interference includes failure to maintain essential conditions).  
   - **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord liable for harm resulting from failure to maintain safe premises).  
   - **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (failure to remedy rodent infestation breached implied warranty).  
   - **Hemingway v. O’Brien**, 363 Mass. 359 (1973) (breach where dwelling unfit for intended use).  
   - **Lipsitt v. Plaud**, 466 Mass. 240 (2013) (tenant entitled to statutory damages under c. 186, § 14).  
   - **Jablonski v. Clemons**, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004) (landlord’s inaction to prevent infestation violates covenant).  
21. The **State Sanitary Code**, adopted under **G.L. c. 111, § 127A**, requires landlords to maintain rental dwellings free from infestation, **105 C.M.R. § 410.550**, and to correct any conditions endangering the health, safety, or welfare of occupants.  
22. Defendant’s failure to comply with these obligations is a violation of public health and housing standards and constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has sustained damages totaling approximately **$280**, representing lost food and replacement storage items, as well as non-economic damages for distress and loss of use.  
24. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, along with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

A. A finding that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;
