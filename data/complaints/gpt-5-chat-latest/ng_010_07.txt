**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. Defendant owns and maintains a residential property located at 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, upon which stands a large, mature maple tree adjacent to the public sidewalk.

8. For a significant period prior to August 15, 2023, a major branch of that tree hanging over the sidewalk was visibly damaged, cracked, and drooping.

9. Neighbors and other residents had observed and expressed concerns to Defendant regarding the hazardous condition of the branch, advising him to have it inspected or removed.

10. Defendant acknowledged the condition but stated he would “deal with it in the spring,” and failed to take any corrective action.

11. On August 15, 2023, during a moderate summer thunderstorm, the cracked branch broke and fell onto the sidewalk as Plaintiff lawfully walked by carrying groceries.

12. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground.

13. Plaintiff sustained a right shoulder strain and multiple bruises, required medical treatment, and suffered pain and limited mobility for several weeks.

14. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $500 in wages from her retail employment due to missed work.

15. Plaintiff continues to experience occasional discomfort and diminished strength in her shoulder.

16. Defendant’s failure to remove, trim, or repair the hazardous tree limb constitutes negligence in the maintenance of his property and in the protection of persons lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk.

**V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.

18. Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining his property and trees so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to lawful users of the adjacent public sidewalk.  
 See *Mennonite Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chiavelli*, 434 Mass. 374 (2001); *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988).

19. Massachusetts law imposes a duty on landowners to act reasonably in maintaining trees and vegetation that may endanger adjoining public areas. See *Andrade v. Perkins Sch. for the Blind*, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208–09 (2007); *Wilbur v. Newton*, 302 Mass. 38, 39 (1938).

20. Defendant breached this duty by failing to inspect, trim, or remove the visibly cracked and dangerous tree limb despite actual and constructive notice of its defective condition.  
 See *Foster v. Loft, Inc.*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 291‑92 (1988); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).

21. Defendant’s inaction constituted a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent homeowner would have exercised under the same circumstances.  
 See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146‑47 (2006).

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost income.  
 See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 318 (2002).

23. The damages sustained were foreseeable and within the scope of the risks created by Defendant’s negligent maintenance of the hazardous tree limb.  
 See *Goldman v. Dennis*, 375 Mass. 197, 199 (1978); *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 548‑49 (1982).

24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for all injuries and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical costs, lost wages, and damages for pain and suffering.  
 See *Coughlin v. Titus & Bean Graphics, Inc.*, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 638 (2002).
