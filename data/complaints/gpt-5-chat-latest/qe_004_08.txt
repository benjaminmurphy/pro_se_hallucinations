---

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 212, §3**, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Worcester District Court.

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy agreement dated June 1, 2020, for the apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, at a rental rate of $1,200 per month.  
6. In or around September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen.  
7. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the infestation promptly.  
8. Defendant placed a few traps but failed to take adequate measures to remedy the problem.  
9. Defendant hired an exterminator only once, and the exterminator indicated that the building required comprehensive treatment beyond a single visit.  
10. Despite Defendant’s knowledge of the continued infestation, Defendant refused to authorize further extermination, stating that it was “normal for older buildings” and “too expensive.”  
11. The infestation has persisted, and Plaintiff continues to find mouse droppings regularly.  
12. As a result, Plaintiff has been forced to discard approximately $200 in contaminated food and expend an additional $80 on airtight containers to protect remaining food.  
13. Plaintiff experiences ongoing distress, anxiety, and interference with her ability to use and enjoy her home, particularly her kitchen.  
14. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a violation of the Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises is liable for actual and consequential damages or three times the rent, whichever is greater, and the tenant’s reasonable attorney’s fees.  
17. The presence of repeated rodent infestation constitutes a serious interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises and renders the property unfit for human habitation.  
18. Defendant had notice of the infestation and failed to take adequate or reasonable corrective measures, thereby breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy.  
19. Plaintiff’s continued exposure to health hazards from the infestation and the loss of use of her kitchen constitute actionable interference.  

**Applicable Law and Legal Authority:**

- **G.L. c. 186, §14** (Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment).  
- **G.L. c. 239, §8A** (Tenant defenses and counterclaims including breach of warranty and quiet enjoyment).  
- **G.L. c. 111, §127A–127L** (Sanitary Code requirements).  
- **105 CMR 410.550 & 410.600** (State Sanitary Code – rodent infestation and extermination duties of landlords).  
- **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord’s responsibility for interference caused by failure to control conditions under his control).  
- **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (repeated interference with habitability can violate covenant of quiet enjoyment).  
- **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (implied warranty of habitability and its connection to quiet enjoyment).  
- **Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.**, 439 Mass. 512 (2003) (scope of “quiet enjoyment” includes substantial interference).  
- **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (constructive interference by landlord can establish a breach).  
- **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (liability does not require intent where interference foreseeably arises from landlord’s acts or omissions).  
- **Hinson v. O’Connor**, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 1120 (2009) (uncontrolled pest infestation constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment).  
- **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. L. Rptr. 693 (2001) (failure to maintain premises free from vermin breaches G.L. c. 186, §14).  

20. Defendant’s conduct fits squarely within the statutory and case law criteria: the repeated and continuing infestation of rodents, known to Defendant, substantially deprived Plaintiff of the full use of her premises.  
21. Defendant’s actions and omissions were willful or, at minimum, grossly negligent, and caused Plaintiff actual damages, including property loss, emotional distress, and interference with her quiet enjoyment.

#### V. DAMAGES

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered:  
   a. Property loss of approximately $280 (discarded food and purchased containers);  
   b. Discomfort, anxiety, and disruption of normal use of the premises; and  
   c. Loss of the quiet enjoyment of her residence.  
23. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages or three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney’s fees (though pro se, she preserves this claim).  

---

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;  
B. Award Plaintiff her actual and consequential damages in the amount of at least $280, or three times monthly rent ($3,600), whichever is greater, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
C. Award costs of this action and any reasonable attorney’s fees permitted by statute;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

#### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
