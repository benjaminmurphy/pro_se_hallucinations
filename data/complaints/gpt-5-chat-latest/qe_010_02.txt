### COMPLAINT  
(For Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Sarah Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) resides at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851, where she is a tenant of the premises owned and managed by Defendant.

2. Defendant **Linda Martinez** (“Defendant”) is a landlord who owns and rents residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851.

3. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy beginning on or about **May 1, 2022**, for the payment of monthly rent in the amount of **$1,200.00**.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000 and the property is located within Middlesex County.

5. Venue in the **Lowell District Court** is proper pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3)**, as the property and cause of action arose in Lowell, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff occupies the rental unit at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, under a written or oral tenancy agreement with Defendant.

7. Beginning in or around **August 2025**, Plaintiff observed a persistent and growing **mold infestation** in the bathroom, starting in the corner of the shower and spreading to the ceiling.

8. The bathroom is enclosed, lacks a window, and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation.

9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition. Defendant inspected the area but refused to take effective remediation steps, instead blaming Plaintiff for “not running the fan enough” and for “taking showers that are too hot and too long.”

10. Despite Plaintiff’s continued use of the exhaust fan during showers and reasonable care in maintaining the premises, the mold problem worsened.

11. Plaintiff began suffering from respiratory symptoms—including coughing, congestion, and wheezing—which a physician linked to mold exposure.

12. Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property, including a shower curtain and towels valued at approximately **$60**, due to mold contamination.

13. Defendant’s refusal to remediate the condition and maintain proper ventilation rendered the premises partially uninhabitable and **interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** of the premises.

14. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent in full and on time, despite the ongoing loss of use and health impacts caused by Defendant’s failure to remedy the mold and provide a habitable environment.

15. Plaintiff estimates that she has sustained **damages in the amount of approximately $500**, representing diminution in rental value, property damage, and discomfort.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.

17. Massachusetts law implies in every residential lease a **covenant of quiet enjoyment**, protecting tenants from substantial interference by the landlord with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714** (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91** (1982).

18. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment” of any residential premises is liable for actual and consequential damages or for not less than three months’ rent, whichever is greater.

19. Defendant’s acts and omissions—specifically her refusal to remedy a known hazardous mold condition and her failure to maintain adequate ventilation—constitute an **unreasonable interference** with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, in violation of the statute.

20. The presence of mold and unsanitary conditions also constitutes a breach of the **warranty of habitability**, established in *Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway*, **363 Mass. 184** (1973), and the corresponding health and safety standards in **105 C.M.R. 410.000**, which set minimum standards of fitness for human habitation.

21. While a breach of the warranty of habitability and covenant of quiet enjoyment are distinct causes of action, the same acts—such as failure to remedy hazardous mold—may give rise to both claims. *Jablonski v. Casey*, **64 Mass. App. Ct. 744** (2005).

22. Defendant’s conduct meets the threshold of “serious interference” recognized in *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847** (1997), and *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority*, **417 Mass. 273** (1994).

23. By failing to maintain habitable premises and refusing necessary repairs, Defendant violated her statutory duties under **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, **G.L. c. 186, §§ 14, 15B**, and the **State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.602, 410.750)**, as well as the implied covenant recognized by Massachusetts common law.

24. Defendant’s interference was direct and substantial, resulting in diminished habitability, health effects, and loss of enjoyment of the premises.

25. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was **intentional, willful, and/or reckless**, as Defendant was repeatedly notified of the problem and refused to take adequate corrective action. See *Richards v. Ready*, **68 Mass. App. Ct. 271** (2007); *Guzzi v. Gage*, **90 Mass. App. Ct. 767** (2016).

26. Defendant’s failures have caused Plaintiff actual damages exceeding $500, including physical discomfort, loss of property, health-related distress, and reduced rental value.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Sarah Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. A finding that Defendant **Linda Martinez** has violated **G.L. c. 186, § 14** by breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. An award of **actual and consequential damages**, or alternatively **three months’ rent ($3,600)**, as provided by statute;  
C. An award of **reasonable costs** pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, including filing fees and service expenses;  
D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the interests of justice.
