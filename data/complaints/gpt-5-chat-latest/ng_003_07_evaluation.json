In fact, the court held the opposite: it found the evidence insufficient to infer that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the icy condition, and reversed the earlier ruling that such an inference was permissible.

Its discussion of foreseeability is narrowly about whether third-party reliance on an agent\u2019s promise to obtain insurance can create a duty, and the court ultimately finds no such duty.
