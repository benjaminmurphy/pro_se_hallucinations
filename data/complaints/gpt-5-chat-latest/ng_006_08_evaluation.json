Jupin squarely holds that a homeowner who allows guns to be stored in her home and grants unsupervised access to someone known to be violent and mentally unstable owes a duty of reasonable care to foreseeable victims, including a police officer later shot with one of those guns. That makes Jupin a directly supportive Massachusetts authority for imposing negligence-based liability on such a defendant.",

This duty is owed to, inter alia, a law enforcement officer shot by the person granted unsupervised access, because the officer is a foreseeable victim of the alleged improper firearm storage.\u201d"

The proposition as stated\u2014\"Relevant Massachusetts authorities establishing Defendant\u2019s liability include:\"\u2014is incomplete and does not identify a specific legal rule (e.g., duty of a premises owner, vicarious liability, etc.). While the case does discuss and partly affirm liability (against Allard and potentially against Wonderland on retrial), without a defined proposition about what kind of \"Defendant\u2019s liability\" is at issue, it cannot be said clearly that this case supports the unspecified proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Davis based his case against Wonderland on two theories: that the described system in use in and about the crosswalk for getting the crowd over the highway was intrinsically inadequate and contributed to the accident, and Wonderland should and could have done better; and that the officer on the particular occasion behaved negligently and Wonderland was responsible for the consequences.\n\n\u2026 The fact is that Wonderland voluntarily undertook the task and was thus cast with a duty to exercise due care in carrying it out."
