**JASMINE REED,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MARK THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. __________**  

---

# **COMPLAINT**

Plaintiff Jasmine Reed (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jasmine Reed is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  
2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual and the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as the matter concerns a residential tenancy within the City of Boston.  
4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the leased premises are located within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  

---

## **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant for a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).  
6. The agreed-upon monthly rent is $1,800.  
7. During the winter months of 2024–2025, the heating system in the Premises repeatedly failed to maintain adequate heat.  
8. On multiple occasions, particularly in the evenings, the temperature in the Premises dropped to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time.  
9. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating issues, and Defendant dispatched repair personnel twice; however, the issue recurred shortly after each visit.  
10. The maintenance personnel advised Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional,” and the Defendant took no further action.  
11. Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters and incurred approximately $150 per month in additional electric charges during the period of inadequate heat.  
12. Plaintiff contracted bronchitis in January 2025, which her physician advised was likely exacerbated by the cold temperatures in her apartment. She missed three days of work and incurred medical expenses, including costs for antibiotics.  
13. The Boston Housing Code (105 C.M.R. § 410.201) requires that every dwelling be capable of maintaining a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 A.M. and 11:00 P.M. and 64°F at all other hours.  
14. Defendant’s failure to maintain heat meeting these minimum standards constitutes a breach of Massachusetts General Laws and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment contained in every residential lease.  
15. Defendant’s conduct interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, making it cold, unhealthy, and uncomfortable.  
16. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages including increased energy bills (estimated at $150 per month for four months), medical costs, and lost wages due to illness, totaling approximately $1,200.

## **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises.  
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from serious interferences with the tenancy not attributable to the tenant’s own acts. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
20. The repeated failure to maintain adequate heat constitutes a material and substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
21. Defendant’s acts and omissions, including his failure to ensure a functioning heating system during winter months, directly caused a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s right to occupy the Premises safely and comfortably.  
22. Massachusetts law recognizes that a landlord’s failure to comply with the State Sanitary Code or to maintain habitable conditions constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Al–Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Darmetko v. Boston Housing Authority*, 378 Mass. 758 (1979).  
23. The landlord’s obligation to maintain heating systems in good repair is also imposed by G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and by 105 C.M.R. §§ 410.190–410.201.  
24. Defendant’s failure to ensure adequate heat violated these statutory and regulatory duties.  
25. Defendant’s response to Plaintiff’s complaints was unreasonable and ineffective, amounting to neglect and indifference rather than prompt rectification as required by law. See *Heman v. O’Shea*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 911 (1985).  
26. Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was further impaired by the resulting health problems and financial hardship caused by Defendant’s conduct. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
27. Defendant’s acts and omissions were willful or, at a minimum, knowing, given that Plaintiff repeatedly notified him of the heating failure and he failed to take adequate corrective measures. See *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
28. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  
29. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages consistent with the terms of G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as compensation for her out-of-pocket expenses.

## **V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant on the claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 (three months’ rent, or actual damages, whichever is greater);  
C. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of approximately $1,200 for heating-related costs, increased electrical expenses, medical costs, and lost wages;  
D. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs of suit pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

## **VI. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
