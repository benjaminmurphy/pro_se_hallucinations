### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **May 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy agreement with Defendant for the lease of a residential apartment located at **45 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139**, at a monthly rent of **$2,200**.  
6. The tenancy has at all relevant times been governed by **G.L. c. 186** and Massachusetts common law.  
7. Beginning in or around **October 1, 2025**, Defendant commenced renovations and construction work in the adjacent apartment within the same building.  
8. The construction, including sustained and repetitive noise from drilling, hammering, and workers’ voices, has continued daily, typically from **8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday**.  
9. The noise, vibration, and dust have caused significant disruption to Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment. Plaintiff works from home and has been unable to conduct telephone and video meetings effectively due to the noise.  
10. Dust from the construction has entered Plaintiff’s apartment through shared ventilation ducts, causing discomfort and unsanitary conditions.  
11. Defendant provided notice of the renovations but failed to take adequate measures to mitigate the intrusion or to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
12. Defendant offered a one-time rent reduction of **$100**, which did not reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the ongoing deprivation of quiet enjoyment.  
13. The renovation work has persisted for approximately **two months** and is expected to continue for at least another **one to two months**, amounting to a total of roughly four months of substantial interference.  
14. Plaintiff has been deprived of the full use and enjoyment of the leased premises during this time period and has suffered a loss valued at approximately **$800** in damages.  
15. Defendant’s actions constitute a **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment** under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
**(G.L. c. 186, §14 and Massachusetts common law)**

16. Plaintiff restates and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease under Massachusetts law. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); **Winthrop Corp. v. Lowenthal**, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 180 (1990).  
19. Breach occurs when the landlord’s actions, or those under his control, substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
20. A landlord need not act with intent; negligent or foreseeable interference may suffice. *See* **Lowell Housing Authority v. Save-More Discount House**, 346 Mass. 426 (1963); **Blackett**, *supra*.  
21. Sustained noise, vibrations, and dust caused by construction under the landlord’s control constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
22. The covenant protects against disturbances that make the premises unsuitable for the purposes for which they were rented. *See* **Winthrop Corp.**, *supra*; **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
23. Defendant’s failure to mitigate excessive construction noise and dust and the duration of the disruption, despite notice of the impact on Plaintiff’s work and residence, constitute a breach under **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
24. Massachusetts courts recognize that even reasonable renovation hours may still violate the covenant when the intrusion materially impairs habitability or ordinary comfort. *See* **Al-Ziab**, *supra*; **Westland Housing Corp. v. Scott**, 312 Mass. 375 (1942).  
25. Plaintiff has not waived any rights to quiet enjoyment under the lease; any attempt at waiver would be void as against public policy under **G.L. c. 186, §15F**.  
26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use, annoyance, inconvenience, and other compensable harm under **G.L. c. 186, §14** and related precedents including **Simon v. Solomon**, *supra*, and **Blackett v. Olanoff**, *supra*.  
27. Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages and, under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, may recover up to three months’ rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, along with attorney’s fees and costs.
