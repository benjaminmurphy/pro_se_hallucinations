### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

**INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), by and for her complaint against Defendant Mark Reynolds (“Defendant”), states and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

2. Defendant Mark Reynolds is an individual residing at the same address, 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, occupying the adjoining half of the duplex property.  

3. Jurisdiction properly lies in the Superior Court Department of the Trial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  

4. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the acts and omissions alleged herein occurred in Springfield, within the county of Hampden.  

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who share a common driveway at their duplex residence located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

6. For an extended period prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant habitually stored a tall aluminum extension ladder in an upright, unsecured position leaning against a wooden fence that bordered the shared driveway.  

7. Plaintiff advised Defendant on multiple occasions that the unsecured ladder posed a danger of falling—particularly during high winds—and that it could damage her vehicle.  

8. Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff that he would tie down or relocate the ladder to prevent it from falling but failed to take any such precautionary measures.  

9. On or about March 15, 2023, Springfield experienced gusty winds.  

10. While Plaintiff was lawfully backing her vehicle into the shared driveway, a strong gust of wind dislodged the ladder, causing it to topple over onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle.  

11. The impact caused visible dents to the hood and cracks to the windshield, rendering the vehicle unsafe to operate until repairs could be completed.  

12. Plaintiff incurred expenses for deductible payments, automobile bodywork, a windshield replacement, and the cost of a rental vehicle during the week-long repair period.  

13. Defendant’s conduct in leaving the ladder unsecured created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm that directly resulted in Plaintiff’s property damage and associated financial losses.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**  

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 13 as though fully set forth herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. *Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).*  

16. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance and placement of personal property within the shared driveway area. *See Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37, 40 (2009).*  

17. Defendant breached this duty by failing to secure or properly store an inherently unstable, freestanding aluminum ladder in an area exposed to outdoor elements and wind. *See Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995) (“Foreseeability of harm determines the duty of care.”).*  

18. Defendant’s failure to secure the ladder, despite Plaintiff’s express warnings, constitutes conduct below the standard of a reasonably prudent person under like circumstances. *See Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc., 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1987).*  

19. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage. *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., 399 Mass. 790, 794 (1987).*  

20. Plaintiff’s resulting damages include repair costs, insurance deductible payments, and rental car expenses, totaling an amount to be proven at trial but reasonably expected to exceed $25,000. *See Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 549 (1982) (damages recoverable when caused by negligent conduct).*  

21. No fault or negligence on the part of Plaintiff contributed to the incident. *See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute).*  

22. Defendant’s conduct demonstrated a disregard for foreseeable risk equivalent to that found actionable under Massachusetts negligence jurisprudence. *See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 56 (1983); Afarian v. Massachusetts Elec. Co., 449 Mass. 257, 261 (2007); Sharpe v. Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc., 401 Mass. 788, 790 (1988).*  

24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages under Massachusetts common law for the cost of repairs, rental car expenses, and any other consequential economic loss proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence. *See Hebert v. Enos, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 817, 818 (2004).*
