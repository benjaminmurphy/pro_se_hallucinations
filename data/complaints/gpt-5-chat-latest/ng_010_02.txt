---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Carter** is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant **Thomas Reynolds** is an individual residing at **123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201**, and is, upon information and belief, the owner and person in control of the residential property located at that address.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in **Berkshire County Superior Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §1, because the cause of action arose in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and Defendant resides within this county.  
5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, §4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **July 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was walking along the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s residence located at **123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts**.  
7. A large **maple tree** stood on or near the property line of Defendant’s premises, and one of its significant branches extended over the public sidewalk.  
8. For a substantial period of time before the incident, one of the tree’s major branches appeared **cracked, drooping, and unstable**.  
9. Plaintiff personally observed that the branch appeared dangerous, and multiple nearby residents had warned Defendant of the condition and advised him to contact an arborist to inspect or remove the defective limb.  
10. Defendant stated to those neighbors that he would “deal with it in the spring,” but he failed to take any remedial action to inspect, trim, or remove the dangerous branch.  
11. On July 15, 2023, during a **typical summer thunderstorm** without extraordinary wind or lightning conditions, the cracked branch snapped and fell onto the public sidewalk.  
12. As Plaintiff lawfully walked on the sidewalk carrying grocery bags, the branch struck her shoulder and back, **knocking her to the ground**.  
13. The impact caused **a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.**  
14. Plaintiff obtained medical treatment for her injuries, incurring **approximately $2,500 in medical expenses**.  
15. Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week, losing **about $600 in wages**.  
16. Plaintiff has endured pain, suffering, and inconvenience resulting from the Defendant’s failure to maintain his tree in a reasonably safe condition.  
17. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that the cracked branch posed an unreasonable risk of harm to members of the public, including pedestrians like Plaintiff.  
18. Defendant’s omission to remedy the defective condition constituted negligence under Massachusetts law.

---

## IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Under **Massachusetts law**, property owners have a duty to maintain **trees and vegetation within their control** in a condition that does not unreasonably endanger individuals lawfully using adjacent public ways. *See* **Michalson v. Nutting**, 275 Mass. 232 (1931) (establishing duty for owners regarding trees that pose danger to travelers).  
21. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful pedestrian on the adjacent sidewalk, a duty to exercise reasonable care to inspect and remove or repair dangerous conditions on property under his control, including diseased or cracked branches overhanging the sidewalk. *See* **Gifford v. Route 20 Associates**, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 840 (2010); **Glenn v. L. & J. Corp.**, 149 Mass. 473 (1889).  
22. Defendant breached that duty by failing to act on known warnings about the unsafe tree branch and by failing to have the tree examined or pruned by a competent arborist. *See* **Cutter v. City of Arlington**, 288 Mass. 384 (1934); **Carter v. Yardley & Co., Ltd.**, 319 Mass. 92 (1946) (negligence may rest on failure to act when a duty exists).  
23. Defendant’s breach was the **direct and proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s physical injuries and economic losses. *See* **Kent v. Commonwealth**, 437 Mass. 312 (2002).  
24. The harm to Plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the tree safely. *See* **Jenkins v. City of Boston**, 199 Mass. 404 (1908).  
25. Defendant’s failure constitutes negligence under the principles set forth in **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302, 364**, adopted in substance under Massachusetts law. *See* **Banagan v. SMG Food Serv., Inc.**, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 614 (2007).  
26. Plaintiff exercised due care and was lawfully using the sidewalk at the time of the incident.  
27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained:  
   a. Physical injuries including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises;  
   b. Medical bills of approximately **$2,500**;  
   c. Lost wages of approximately **$600**; and  
   d. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.  
28. Under Massachusetts negligence law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover all compensatory damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct. *See* **Alemeida v. Watertown**, 460 Mass. 552 (2011); **Roderick v. Brandy Hill Co., Inc.**, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 948 (1994); **Mass. G.L. c. 231, §85** (comparative negligence standard).
