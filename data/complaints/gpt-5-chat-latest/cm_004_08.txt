**EMILY JOHNSON,**  
Plaintiff,

v.

**MICHAEL SMITH,**  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209, § 37, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (as applicable), to modify the existing custody order entered by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court on **March 15, 2018**, regarding the minor child, **Liam Smith (age 8)**. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Emily Johnson, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and current primary physical custodian of the minor child, Liam Smith. Her contact information is (617) 555‑0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Smith, father of the minor child, presently residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to M.G.L. c. 215, § 6, and M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, because the original custody judgment was issued by this Court and both parents continue to reside in Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court.

---

## **III. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER**

5. On **March 15, 2018**, the Court entered a custody and parenting order granting **Emily Johnson** primary physical custody of the parties’ minor son, **Liam Smith**, then age three.  
6. At that time, **Michael Smith** was granted three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit, with **no overnights**, due to his then‑limited housing situation (a single room in a shared apartment not suitable for overnight parenting).  
7. Both parties have substantially complied with the original order since 2018.

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since entry of the last order, material and substantial changes have occurred in the lives of the parties and the minor child that affect the child’s best interests, warranting modification under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and controlling caselaw.  
9. The most significant changes include:  
   a. The child, **Liam**, is now **eight years old** and enrolled in school full time.  
   b. **Michael Smith** has obtained stable housing—his own apartment—where Liam has a dedicated bedroom and safe, appropriate sleeping arrangements.  
   c. The child has developed a close and strong relationship with both parents and regularly asks for overnight visits with his father.  
   d. The current parenting plan—three brief visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon—requires frequent transitions, which disrupts the child’s after‑school schedule, increases fatigue, and interferes with homework and bedtime routines.  
   e. The child’s evolving developmental, emotional, and educational needs require a schedule that provides longer, more meaningful parenting time with each parent and minimizes mid‑week disruption.  
10. Both parents now agree that the schedule no longer fits their child’s best interests or current needs.  
11. Under Massachusetts law, a court may modify an existing custody order where there has been a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties or the child, and modification is in the child’s best interests. *See, e.g.*, **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
12. The facts enumerated above constitute a material change in circumstances as contemplated by these authorities.

---

## **V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

13. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, “[u]pon a complaint after a divorce, the court may … make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the children as changed circumstances warrant.”  
14. The guiding standard is the **“best interests of the child”**—the paramount concern in custody matters. *See* **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  
15. The requested modification is designed to promote stability and continuity in Liam’s routines, consistent with **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), which emphasizes continuity and stability as fundamental to a child’s welfare.  
16. Massachusetts courts have recognized that modification is proper where a child’s age or circumstances change significantly since the prior order. *See* **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  
17. The Court has discretion to fashion a new custody schedule that minimizes parental conflict while serving the child’s developmental needs, per **Care and Protection of Zita**, 455 Mass. 272 (2009) and **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).  
18. Stability of home and school life is an important consideration, but evolving needs and housing suitability can justify modification. *See* **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Canning v. Juskalian**, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 202 (1992).  
19. Here, both parents agree the present parenting plan is no longer workable; such mutual acknowledgment of changed circumstances further supports granting this Complaint. *See* **Pizzino**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 870.

## **VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

20. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the March 15, 2018 custody order to reflect a parenting schedule that includes **overnight visits** with the father (**Michael Smith**) and reduces the frequency of short mid‑week transitions.  
21. Specifically, Plaintiff proposes that the current schedule be replaced with the following general framework (subject to the Court’s further determination of details):  

   - **Primary Physical Custody:** to remain with Emily Johnson;  
   - **Overnights:** Michael Smith shall have one mid‑week overnight and alternate weekends from Friday after school through Sunday evening;  
   - **School holidays, vacations, and special days:** to be shared equitably;  
   - **All other provisions** of the prior judgment to remain in effect except as modified by the Court.

22. The requested changes reflect Liam’s age, school attendance, emotional development, and both parents’ stable circumstances.

---

## **VII. CONCLUSION**

For all the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the minor child since entry of the March 15, 2018 order;  
2. **Modify** the prior custody and parenting time order to include a developmentally appropriate schedule with overnight visitation as outlined herein;  
3. **Grant** such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
