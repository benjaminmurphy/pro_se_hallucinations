1. Plaintiff **Jordan Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 231, §1**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court and the cause of action arises under Massachusetts law.  
4. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, §2**, because the property that is the subject of this action is located in Somerville, and Defendant conducts business there.

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **May 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the second-floor apartment at **123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, Massachusetts**, for a monthly rent of **$1,800**.  
6. Said lease expressly provides that the tenant “shall have the right to quiet enjoyment” of the premises during the term of tenancy.  
7. Beginning approximately **June 2025**, the tenants residing in the third-floor apartment commenced creating persistent, excessive noise, including heavy stomping, loud music during late hours, and the moving of furniture at night.  
8. The noise has occurred on an almost daily basis, often continuing past midnight, and has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and to use and enjoy the rented premises.  
9. Plaintiff repeatedly complained to Defendant, on at least five or six occasions between July and November 2025, regarding the severe noise and lack of peace and quiet.  
10. Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants once, but thereafter stated that he “can’t control how people live” and took no further meaningful steps to abate the disturbance.  
11. The disruptive conditions have continued unabated.  
12. As a result of the ongoing noise and Defendant’s failure to address it, Plaintiff has suffered sleep deprivation, emotional distress, workplace performance issues (including a formal reprimand), and medical expenses, including sleep medication costing approximately **$40 per month**.  
13. Plaintiff has attempted reasonable self-help measures, including the use of earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranging furniture, to no avail.  
14. Plaintiff estimates damages in the amount of **$3,600**, representing at least two months’ rent as compensatory damages for the loss of quiet enjoyment and out-of-pocket expenses, and seeks additional statutory damages as provided by law.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment” of the leased premises.  
17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy in Massachusetts. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 95 (1982).  
18. The covenant protects a tenant’s right to freedom from serious interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by acts or omissions of the landlord or those for whom the landlord is responsible. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977).  
19. A landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent or remedy ongoing disturbances caused by other tenants under the same landlord’s control constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  
20. The landlord’s duty includes responding effectively when one tenant’s behavior substantially interferes with another’s use of the premises. **Trustees of 226 South St. Condo. Trust v. Richardson**, 470 Mass. 491, 497 (2015).  
21. Defendant’s statements that he “can’t control how people live” reflect a refusal to exercise his legal right and duty to intervene or enforce lease provisions against the offending tenants, thereby allowing the nuisance to continue.  
22. Defendant’s inaction was not reasonable under the circumstances and directly caused a substantial and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
23. Such interference constitutes a breach under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, as interpreted in **Winthrop M. Corp. v. Lowenthal**, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 184 (1990); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997);**Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); **Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc.**, 437 Mass. 708, 720 (2002); and **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855, 872 (1991).  
24. Defendant’s failure to remedy the situation resulted in constructive interference rising to a deprivation of quiet enjoyment. See **Simon v. Solomon**, supra; **Blackett v. Olanoff**, supra.  
25. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use, mental distress, sleep loss, and medical expenses directly attributable to Defendant’s breach of duty.

#### V. DAMAGES

26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Defendant is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater. Plaintiff’s rent is $1,800 per month; therefore, the statutory minimum damages are **$5,400**.  
27. Plaintiff additionally seeks recovery for consequential damages, including medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, as compensable under **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 111.  
28. Plaintiff also requests reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, even if self-represented, to the extent provided by **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jordan Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
b. Award Plaintiff statutory damages of **three months’ rent ($5,400)** or actual damages proven at trial, whichever is greater;  
c. Award additional compensatory damages, including $40 per month for medical expenses and other consequential losses;  
d. Award attorney’s fees and court costs as authorized by statute;  
e. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

#### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
