Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(M.G.L. c. 208 § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C § 20; and related provisions)  

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Lisa Montgomery** (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws and applicable case authorities, to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2020**, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.  

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Lisa Montgomery, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and primary custodial parent of the minor children, **Emma Davis** (date of birth: [substitute DOB]) and **Noah Davis** (date of birth: [substitute DOB]).  
2. **Defendant:** Mark Davis, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the father of the minor children.  

---

## **II. JURISDICTION**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which authorizes modification of custody and visitation orders upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and where such modification serves the **best interests of the children**.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court as both parties and the minor children reside within Bristol County.  

---

## **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

5. On or about **May 15, 2020**, this Court issued a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time**, granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody and awarding the Defendant parenting time **every other weekend and one overnight during the week**.  
6. At the time of that order, both parties worked regular daytime schedules, and the parenting arrangement allowed for stable routines consistent with the children’s schooling and welfare.  
7. Within the past year, the Defendant began a new job requiring him to work **7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.** on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights designated for his overnight parenting time under the existing order.  
8. As a result of his changed work schedule, the Defendant has repeatedly been **unable to exercise his overnight custody**, either:  
   a. delivering the children to the Plaintiff with minimal notice because he was too fatigued to supervise them after his shift; or  
   b. **leaving them with a roommate** unrelated to the children and with whom the Plaintiff has no established trust or prior agreement.  
9. The minor children, **Emma (age 8)** and **Noah (age 6)**, have reported falling asleep on the couch while their father naps after overnight work shifts, reflecting a **lack of adequate supervision, rest, and structure** during those periods.  
10. The Defendant’s change in employment and its disruptive effect on the existing overnight schedule constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the original custody order.  
11. The current arrangement no longer serves the children’s **best interests**, as it has led to unpredictability, lack of rest, and inconsistent supervision.  

---

## **IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

12. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the prior judgment and if the modification is necessary in the child’s best interests.  
13. Similarly, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20** governs modification of custody and visitation orders for unmarried parents, applying the same “best interests” and “material change in circumstances” standard.  
14. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have long recognized that when a parent’s ability to exercise parenting time materially changes, the Court may modify the existing custody order. See, e.g.:  
   1. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) — the child’s welfare and the best interests standard control custody modifications.  
   2. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) — substantial changes require reassessment of the custody arrangement.  
   3. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) — material changes such as altered work schedules can justify modification.  
   4. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) — the best interests test is paramount, focusing on stability, continuity, and emotional health.  
   5. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2011) — modification warranted when changed circumstances affect the child’s welfare.  
   6. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) — family dynamics and parental availability are key to determining best interests.  
   7. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) — parental work schedule changes constitute valid grounds for modification.  
   8. *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976) — courts may alter custody when circumstances change materially post-judgment.  
   9. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) — parenting stability and reliable supervision are fundamental to a child’s well-being.  
   10. *M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 31 & 31A* — define the legal framework for custody and shared parenting determinations.  
15. The Defendant’s new employment schedule and the resulting inability consistently to exercise overnight parenting time reflect **a substantial and material change** directly affecting the children’s welfare.  
16. The proposed modification aligns with both **statutory mandates** and **Massachusetts precedent**, aiming to ensure the children’s safety, emotional stability, and consistent care.

## **V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Lisa Montgomery**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Modify the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** dated May 15, 2020, to reflect the material change in circumstances.  
2. Order that:  
   a. The Defendant’s **overnight parenting time** occur only on days when he is **not scheduled to work overnight**;  
   b. The parties adjust **daytime visitation** or non-overnight periods as necessary to maintain meaningful contact between the Defendant and the minor children;  
   c. All exchanges occur in a manner promoting the children’s stability and routine; and  
   d. Any additional relief this Court finds just and proper under **M.G.L. c. 208 § 28** and the **best interests of the children** standard.  

---

Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025**.
