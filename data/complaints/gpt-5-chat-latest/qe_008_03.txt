### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

### INTRODUCTION  

Plaintiff Jessica Harris (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against her landlord, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, section 14. Defendant’s prolonged failure to repair the main entry door to the building located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts, created unsafe conditions that substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s tenancy, resulting in loss of property, expense, and distress.

---

### PARTIES  

1. **Plaintiff Jessica Harris** resides at 15 Mystic Street, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  
2. **Defendant Mark Thompson** is an individual who owns and manages the building located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150. Upon information and belief, Defendant conducts business as a residential landlord within Suffolk County.

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 212, § 3.  
4. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court because the property at issue is located in Chelsea and the acts complained of occurred within this jurisdiction. See *Davis v. Comerford*, 483 Mass. 164, 166 (2019).

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. Plaintiff entered into a written residential tenancy with Defendant beginning on or about May 1, 2022, for premises located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,500 to Defendant.  
7. The main entry door to the building has a broken lock and does not latch properly, permitting unauthorized entry.  
8. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the defective door approximately two months prior to December 1, 2025, and Defendant promised to repair the lock.  
9. Despite repeated reminders—at least two additional communications—Defendant failed and refused to make the necessary repair.  
10. As a result, unauthorized individuals have entered the building without permission.  
11. In November 2025, mail and packages were tampered with or stolen from the common hallway, including a package belonging to Plaintiff valued at approximately $120.  
12. Plaintiff has also discovered evidence indicating that unknown individuals have been sleeping in the building’s basement, causing serious safety and security concerns.  
13. Because of Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff incurred expenses of approximately $200 to purchase a personal security camera and install an upgraded deadbolt on her apartment door.  
14. Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant about the unsafe conditions. Defendant responded dismissively, stating that Plaintiff was “overreacting.”  
15. Defendant’s persistent failure to remedy the security breach has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.  
16. Plaintiff has suffered loss of property, financial cost, and fear for her safety as a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions.

### COUNT I  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–16.  
18. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises is liable for damages or, where appropriate, rent abatement and other statutory relief.  
19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees tenants the right to peaceful and habitable possession, free from substantial interference caused by the landlord or the landlord’s failure to act. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715–16 (1977).  
20. Defendant’s failure to maintain secure common areas constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982) (landlord’s failure to act in face of ongoing harm constitutes interference); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  
21. Massachusetts law imposes on lessors a duty to maintain common areas in a condition that does not endanger tenants’ safety. *Lipsitz v. Smith*, 236 Mass. 72, 74 (1920); see also *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 165–66 (1980).  
22. Defendant’s inaction in repairing the entry lock after repeated notice constitutes “direct or indirect interference” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1979).  
23. The resulting repeated intrusions, theft, and lack of security are precisely the type of interferences deemed actionable in similar cases. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Winthrop Realty Trust v. Schrank*, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 1009 (1983).  
24. Plaintiff has suffered damages, including loss of property and out-of-pocket expenses totaling approximately $320, along with significant inconvenience and anxiety.  
25. Defendant’s conduct was knowing, willful, and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under the law. See *Hemingway v. Taylor*, 203 Mass. 68, 71 (1909); *Simon v. Solomon*, supra.  
26. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for actual and statutory damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees (even if none are sought here because Plaintiff is self-represented).
