2. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained property damage to her automobile and incurred related losses including repair and rental expenses.  

---

**II. PARTIES**

3. Plaintiff **Jessica Turner** is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, granting the Superior Court original jurisdiction in civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.  

6. Venue is proper in the **Hampden Superior Court**, pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, because the acts complained of occurred in Hampden County, and both parties reside therein.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. Plaintiff and Defendant occupy separate halves of a duplex residence located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway adjacent to a wooden fence.  

8. For a significant period prior to March 2023, Defendant stored a tall aluminum extension ladder standing upright, leaning loosely against the fence, within a few feet of where Plaintiff customarily parked her car.  

9. Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant on multiple occasions that the ladder was unstable and could fall, particularly during high winds, potentially causing damage or injury.  

10. Defendant assured Plaintiff he would secure or move the ladder, but he failed to do so.  

11. On or about **March 15, 2023**, a strong gust of wind knocked the unsecured ladder over, causing it to fall directly onto Plaintiff’s vehicle as she was backing into the driveway.  

12. The ladder struck the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s car, denting the hood and cracking the glass.  

13. The vehicle required bodywork and windshield replacement, which Plaintiff’s insurance covered except for a deductible she had to pay out of pocket.  

14. Plaintiff also incurred additional costs for a rental car while her vehicle was being repaired.  

15. Defendant’s negligence in failing to secure the ladder despite clear foreseeability of harm directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s property damage and related financial losses.

**V. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, maintenance, and control of property to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others. **See Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful co-occupant and foreseeable neighbor, a duty to exercise reasonable care in placing, maintaining, and securing objects—particularly tall ladders—on or near shared premises.  

19. Defendant breached that duty by failing to adequately secure or store the aluminum ladder in a manner that would prevent its foreseeable fall during typical weather conditions.  

20. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the ladder posed a substantial risk of physical injury or property damage under windy conditions. **See Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006).  

21. A reasonably prudent person, under similar circumstances, would have secured or relocated the ladder to prevent it from falling. **See Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  

22. Defendant's failure to act constituted negligence under longstanding Massachusetts precedent imposing liability for foreseeable harms resulting from unsafe property conditions. **See O'Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201, 204–05 (2000); **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148, 153 (2013).  

23. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage and financial loss. **See Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.**, 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law).  

24. Plaintiff sustained actual damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Automobile repair costs for damage to the hood and windshield;  
   b. Insurance deductible expenses; and  
   c. Costs for rental vehicle use during repair.  

25. Under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, Plaintiff’s own exercise of due care is presumed, and no comparative negligence applies as Plaintiff had no ability to prevent the falling ladder.  

26. Defendant’s breach constitutes actionable negligence for foreseeable property damage under **Massachusetts common law** and the **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302, 303**, as adopted by Massachusetts courts. **See Whittaker v. Saraceno**, 418 Mass. 196, 199 (1994); **Greene v. DiFazio**, 148 F. Supp. 3d 116, 122 (D. Mass. 2015).  

---

**VI. DAMAGES**

27. As a direct result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage and consequential expenses totaling approximately $3,200, including repair costs, deductible, and vehicle rental.  

28. Plaintiff continues to suffer inconvenience and loss of use arising from Defendant’s failure to exercise ordinary care.  

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Turner** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Mark Dorsey** on the claim of negligence;  
B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but reasonably estimated to exceed **$3,200**, including all amounts permitted under Massachusetts law;  
C. Award costs, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---

**VIII. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to **Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b)**.
