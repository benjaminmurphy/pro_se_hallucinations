Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. _______**  

------------------------------------------------------  
### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)  
------------------------------------------------------  

**I. PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff *Emily Santos* (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 45 Broadway Street, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant *Michael Thompson* (“Defendant”) is an individual and the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts.  

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19 and G.L. c. 212, §3, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court because the property at issue is located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Chelsea District Court.  

**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential rental agreement with Defendant for an apartment unit located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,600.  
6. Defendant is responsible for maintaining and securing the common areas, including the main entry door to the building.  
7. Beginning approximately in October 2025, the main entry door’s lock stopped working properly. The latch no longer secured the door, allowing anyone to enter the building without a key.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of this defect. Defendant acknowledged the problem and promised to repair it but failed to do so.  
9. Plaintiff has reminded Defendant at least twice since the initial report, but no repair has been made.  
10. In November 2025, an unknown person entered the building through the unsecured main door and went through residents’ mail. Packages were stolen from the hallway, including one belonging to Plaintiff valued at approximately $120.  
11. Plaintiff has since discovered signs that an unauthorized person has been sleeping in the building’s basement, causing Plaintiff fear, anxiety, and loss of peaceful enjoyment of her home.  
12. Plaintiff purchased and installed a personal security camera and an improved deadbolt lock on her apartment door at her own expense of approximately $200.  
13. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant has failed and refused to correct the defective front door lock.  
14. Defendant’s conduct has interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, as guaranteed by G.L. c. 186, §14.  

**IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(**G.L. c. 186, §14**)  

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, every rental of residential premises includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, the violation of which entitles the tenant to statutory damages.  
17. G.L. c. 186, §14 provides that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”  
18. Defendant’s failure to maintain the security of the building’s entrance constitutes an “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her apartment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14. *See*, *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982) (landlord’s failure to remedy serious disturbances constitutes violation of G.L. c. 186, §14).  
19. Defendant’s inaction permitted repeated unauthorized entry into the building, mail theft, and other disturbances that deprived Plaintiff of the peace, comfort, and security contemplated by the tenancy. *See* *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  
20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment “protects the tenant from serious interference with her tenancy.” *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982). The Defendant’s failure to secure the premises is a serious interference.  
21. A landlord’s omission to repair known defects that create security or safety risks constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment. *See* *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 749 (2005).  
22. The Defendant’s actions and omissions were willful, knowing, and undertaken with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s rights. *See* *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 717–18 (1977).  
23. Plaintiff suffered actual damages including emotional distress, loss of property valued at approximately $120, and security expenditures of approximately $200 as a result of Defendant’s breach.  
24. Defendant’s conduct also constitutes an unfair and deceptive act under the principles articulated in *Simon v. Solomon*, *supra*, and *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 871 (1991), though Plaintiff limits her claim here to G.L. c. 186, §14.  
25. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  

**V. DAMAGES**  

26. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered:  
   a. Property loss of approximately $120;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses for additional security of approximately $200;  
   c. Emotional distress and anxiety arising from repeated unauthorized entries; and  
   d. Loss of peaceful enjoyment and security in her home.  

27. Plaintiff estimates her monetary damages to total at least $320, subject to trebling under G.L. c. 186, §14, plus costs.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on her claim under G.L. c. 186, §14;  
B. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $320, or alternatively three months’ rent ($4,800), whichever is greater, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14;  
C. Award Plaintiff her costs of suit;  
D. Award statutory attorney’s fees under G.L. c. 186, §14; and  
E. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
