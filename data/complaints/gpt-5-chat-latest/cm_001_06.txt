# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

**(M.G.L. c. 208, §28; M.G.L. c. 209C, §20; M.G.L. c. 215, §6)**

**Filed:** December 1, 2025

## **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Laura Jenkins, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is (617) 555‑0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Jenkins, also residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the father of the minor children Sophie Jenkins (born [DOB not provided]) and Ethan Jenkins (born [DOB not provided]).

---

## **II. JURISDICTION**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as this Court issued the original custody order on May 15, 2020, and both parties and the minor children continue to reside within Middlesex County.  
4. Venue lies in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** pursuant to **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 82** and **G. L. c. 215, § 6**.

---

## **III. PRIOR ORDER**

5. On **May 15, 2020**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** establishing that:  
   - The parties share legal custody of the minor children;  
   - The Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, maintains primary physical custody;  
   - The Defendant, Michael Jenkins, has parenting time every other weekend and one overnight mid‑week.

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. Since entry of the May 15, 2020 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children.  
7. The Defendant recently began employment requiring overnight shifts from **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** several nights each week, including many of the nights during which he is scheduled for overnight parenting time.  
8. Due to these work hours, the Defendant has repeatedly been unable to exercise his court‑ordered overnight parenting time, often returning the children to the Plaintiff’s residence with minimal or no notice.  
9. When the Defendant does retain the children overnight, he often leaves them in the care of a roommate who is not well‑known to the Plaintiff and is not an appropriate substitute caregiver.  
10. The minor children, Sophie (8) and Ethan (6), have reported that they frequently sleep on the couch at the Defendant’s home while he sleeps after his overnight shifts, and that their routines and rest are disrupted.  
11. The Defendant’s changed work schedule and reliance on others for supervision create instability, disrupt the children’s normal sleep and school patterns, and materially impact their well‑being.  
12. The Plaintiff remains the consistent custodial parent available to care for the children during nights and school days, providing continuity and stability as required under Massachusetts law.

## **V. LEGAL STANDARD**

13. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a custody or visitation judgment upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and where modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  
14. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that custody and parenting orders are subject to modification where substantial changes affect the child’s welfare. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rosenberg v. Rosenberg*, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (1992).  
15. The Court in *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981) held that modification is justified when the custodial arrangement no longer meets the child’s best interests due to unforeseen circumstances.  
16. Factors relevant to the *best interests of the child* include stability, parental availability, and continuity of care. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Yannas*, supra.  
17. Changes in parental employment affecting a parent’s ability to maintain parenting time may constitute a material change. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  
18. A parent’s delegation of overnight care to non‑parent individuals without agreement may justify modification when it interferes with stability. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
19. The Court’s primary concern remains the best interests and welfare of the children. *Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711; *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. 595 (1981).  
20. The Plaintiff satisfies the burden of showing a material change warranting modification under **G. L. c. 208, § 28** and **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 208, § 31** (defining custody and parental responsibilities), and seeks an order aligning the parenting schedule with the current realities of the Defendant’s work schedule and the children’s welfare.

## **VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

21. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody and parenting time judgment to provide that:  
   a. The Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur **only on nights when he is not scheduled to work overnight**;  
   b. The weeknight overnight visit shall be suspended or rescheduled to daytime or weekend hours when the Defendant is off duty;  
   c. Any exchanges shall occur with reasonable notice to ensure stability for the children; and  
   d. All other provisions of the prior judgment shall remain in effect unless inconsistent with the modified order.

---

## **VII. RELIEF REQUESTED**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the May 15, 2020 Judgment affecting the best interests of the minor children, pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**;  
2. Enter a **Modified Judgment** adjusting Defendant’s parenting schedule to reflect his current overnight work hours and the children’s best interests;  
3. Order that the Defendant’s overnight parenting time occur only on non‑working nights and that mid‑week visitation be limited to periods when he is rested and available for active care;  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
