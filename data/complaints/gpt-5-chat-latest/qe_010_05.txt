**JESSICA TURNER,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  

**MARIA JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.

**Civil Action No. ____________**  

**COMPLAINT**  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
________________________________________

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Turner** (“Plaintiff”) resides at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, where she rents an apartment from the Defendant.  
2. Defendant **Maria Johnson** (“Defendant”) is the owner and lessor of the premises located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (“the Premises”).  

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Lowell District Court under G.L. c. 218, § 19A and G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the property is located in Lowell, Massachusetts and the Defendant resides or conducts business there.  
4. The amount in controversy does not exceed $7,000, thus falling within the civil jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease with Defendant for the apartment located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff has remained in possession and has continuously paid rent of $1,200 per month.  
6. The lease agreement carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. G.L. c. 186, § 14; *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  
7. Beginning in or around June 2025, mold began to appear in the bathroom of Plaintiff’s apartment. The mold started in the corner of the shower and spread across the ceiling.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant inspected the bathroom but failed to take reasonable corrective measures, instead blaming Plaintiff for the mold’s occurrence.  
9. Defendant refused to remedy the underlying cause of the mold—namely inadequate ventilation in a windowless bathroom—and declined to take steps to ensure the premises were habitable and safe.  
10. As a result of the mold, Plaintiff experienced respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, and was medically advised that the condition was related to mold exposure.  
11. Plaintiff also suffered property loss in the amount of approximately $60 for a shower curtain and towels that became mold-damaged and had to be discarded.  
12. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated requests, Defendant has failed and refused to make reasonable repairs or ensure adequate ventilation, and has thereby substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1–12 above.  
14. Massachusetts law provides that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises” under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
15. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
16. The presence of mold and the landlord’s failure to remediate environmental or habitability issues constitute substantial interference. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Darmetko v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 378 Mass. 758 (1979) (failure to remedy unsanitary and unsafe conditions violates quiet enjoyment).  
17. Defendant’s failure to correct hazardous conditions and maintain proper ventilation violates the sanitary code, 105 C.M.R. § 410.000 et seq., evidencing interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  
18. Defendant’s conduct is an “indirect act” that constitutes interference under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
19. Plaintiff’s injuries, including respiratory distress, aggravation, and property loss, are the foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach.  
20. Under *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979), landlords are liable under § 14 even where the interference results from neglect or failure to correct known defects.  
21. The existence of mold and the uninhabitable condition further violate the implied warranty of habitability, *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), which supports and parallels the claim under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
22. The Massachusetts sanitary code provisions at 105 C.M.R. §§ 410.500–410.550 require bathrooms to be adequately ventilated and free from chronic dampness; Defendant’s refusal to correct deficient ventilation violates those standards. See *Hastings v. Taylor*, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 535 (1997).  
23. Plaintiff has suffered damages of approximately $600, including property damage, medical expenses, and diminution in the rental value of the apartment.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Turner** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Maria Johnson** for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award statutory damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, or actual damages in the amount of **$600**, whichever is greater;  
C. Award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, notwithstanding that Plaintiff appears pro se;  
D. Award any additional equitable relief this Court deems just and proper, including an order requiring Defendant to remediate the mold and correct the ventilation deficiency; and  
E. Grant such further relief as justice and equity may require.

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025,  
in Lowell, Massachusetts.
