### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a public path at **Newton Commonwealth Park** in Newton, Massachusetts.  
7. At all relevant times, the City of Newton maintained and posted visible signs requiring that **all dogs be kept on leashes** within the park.  
8. Defendant was present in the park with his large dog, which he allowed to roam freely and **unleashed**, despite clearly posted leash laws and ordinances.  
9. Defendant had actual and constructive knowledge that the park’s regulations required leashing of dogs, yet he **willfully disregarded** those regulations.  
10. While Plaintiff was jogging, Defendant’s unleashed dog suddenly **charged directly at her**, barking loudly and in a manner causing Plaintiff to fear an imminent attack.  
11. Defendant was approximately thirty feet away, talking with friends, with the dog’s leash draped over his shoulder but not attached to the dog.  
12. To avoid being bitten or otherwise harmed by the onrushing dog, Plaintiff took evasive action, **swerving off the path** and tripping over a tree root.  
13. Plaintiff fell down a small embankment and sustained a **fracture to her wrist** as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.  
14. The dog stopped its pursuit as Plaintiff fell, and Defendant eventually recalled it.  
15. Several parkgoers and joggers witnessed the entire incident and observed Defendant’s lack of control over his dog.  
16. Plaintiff required emergency medical care, incurring **medical expenses of approximately $3,500**.  
17. Plaintiff also lost approximately **$1,200 in wages** due to her inability to work while recovering.  
18. Plaintiff’s wrist injury caused substantial pain and suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, including her inability to perform at a planned piano recital.  
19. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a lawful park user, to exercise reasonable care in controlling his dog in a foreseeable public setting.  
20. Defendant breached that duty by **failing to leash his dog** and by allowing it to approach and alarm members of the public, including Plaintiff.  
21. As a **direct and proximate result** of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, emotional distress, and economic losses.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

22. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 21 above as if fully set forth herein.  
23. Under Massachusetts law, to establish negligence, a plaintiff must show **(1)** the existence of a duty of reasonable care, **(2)** a breach of that duty, **(3)** causation, and **(4)** damages. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006).  
24. Defendant owed a duty under **Massachusetts common law** and **M.G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157**, as well as municipal regulations of Newton, to control his dog and prevent foreseeable harm to others.  
25. Defendant breached his duty by allowing his large dog to roam unleashed in a known public area contrary to posted rules, creating an unreasonable risk of harm to park users.  
26. A reasonable person under like circumstances would have ensured that the dog remained leashed and under physical control at all times. See *Glidden v. Szybiak*, 368 Mass. 800, 803 (1975) (dog owners have duty to prevent harm caused by their animals).  
27. Defendant’s act of failing to leash the dog constitutes negligence in violation of both common-law principles and statutory duties designed to protect the public from this very type of harm.  
28. Defendant’s breach was the **proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injuries. It was foreseeable that an unleashed, barking dog charging at a pedestrian could cause fear and evasive action resulting in injury. *Poskus v. Lombardo’s*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (foreseeability central to proximate cause).  
29. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting fractured wrist are a **natural and probable consequence** of Defendant’s negligence. *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).  
30. Defendant’s conduct was in violation of *M.G.L. c. 140, § 173* (municipal control of dogs and enforcement of leash laws) and Newton’s municipal leash ordinance.  
31. Under *M.G.L. c. 231, § 85*, the comparative negligence statute, Plaintiff was not negligent and bears no fault for her injuries.  
32. Plaintiff expended and will continue to expend substantial sums for medical care, rehabilitation, and therapy.  
33. Plaintiff suffered lost income, physical pain, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. *Sena v. Commonwealth*, 417 Mass. 250, 256 (1994).  
34. Defendant’s negligence was the **direct and proximate cause** of all of Plaintiff’s damages, for which he is legally responsible under Massachusetts law.
