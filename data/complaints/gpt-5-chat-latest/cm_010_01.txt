Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
**(Custody and Parenting Time)**  

**Filed:** December 1, 2025  

---

### I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION  

1. This is a Complaint for Modification brought pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209, § 37**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, seeking modification of an existing custody and parenting-time order entered by this Court on **May 15, 2018** in the above-captioned matter.  

2. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Weston Probate and Family Court** because both parties and the minor child reside within this Court’s jurisdiction, and the original custody order was issued by this Court.  

---

### II. PARTIES  

3. **Plaintiff:** *Samantha Carter*, residing in Weston, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, **Emily Carter (age 10)**. Plaintiff may be contacted at *(617) 555‑0123* or *psm1443@gmail.com.*  

4. **Defendant:** *David Carter*, residing in Weston, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child.  

---

### III. PRIOR ORDERS  

5. On **May 15, 2018**, this Court issued a custody and parenting-time order (the “Existing Order”) providing that David Carter shall have **primary physical custody** of the minor child, and Samantha Carter shall have **limited weekend visitation** and **one weeknight dinner per week**.  

6. The 2018 order was based on the circumstances existing at that time, including the Plaintiff’s enrollment in graduate school, her residence in a small studio apartment, and a lack of schedule flexibility.  

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES  

7. Since the entry of the Existing Order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor child within the meaning of **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, rendering modification necessary and proper.  

8. Specifically:  

   a. Plaintiff has completed her graduate education, obtained stable full-time employment with predictable hours, and is now able to provide a consistent, nurturing environment for the child.  

   b. Plaintiff now resides in a two-bedroom apartment, providing Emily with her own bedroom, thereby addressing prior housing limitations that influenced the original order.  

   c. The minor child, now ten years old and significantly older and more mature than at age four, has expressed a clear and sustained desire to spend additional time with her mother.  

   d. The child’s therapist reports that Emily experiences emotional distress and guilt when her visits with her mother end and that greater time with Plaintiff would support her psychological well-being.  

   e. Defendant has refused to discuss potential adjustments to the parenting schedule and has responded with anger when the child raises the issue, contributing to emotional conflict and stress within the child’s home environment.  

9. These developments collectively constitute a **material change in circumstances** pursuant to the standards set forth in *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. 1031 (2009); and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

10. Continuation of the prior custodial arrangement is inconsistent with the child’s best interests. Massachusetts law provides that a custody order may be modified “upon a showing of changed circumstances and where modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.” *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  

---

### V. APPLICABLE LAW  

11. The statutory basis for this request derives from:  

   - **G.L. c. 208, § 28** (modification upon a material and substantial change in circumstances);  
   - **G.L. c. 208, § 31** (definition of shared legal and physical custody and governing standard of the child’s best interests);  
   - **G.L. c. 215, § 6** (probate court jurisdiction over custody matters);  
   - **G.L. c. 208, § 29** (enforcement and modification of family law decrees).  

12. Massachusetts case law consistently requires that modification be based on post-judgment changes that affect the child’s welfare and best interests, including:  

   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012);  
   - *Rogers v. Rogers*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 582 (2016);  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   - *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015);  
   - *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015);  
   - *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); and  
   - *G.L. c. 208, § 34*, regarding equitable family law remedies.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD  

13. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody determinations. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

14. Emily’s emotional health, stability, and development would be enhanced by increased parenting time with her mother, who now enjoys the resources, space, and flexibility to support Emily’s daily needs.  

15. The proposed adjustment would foster a healthy, consistent relationship with both parents in compliance with the objectives of **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31**, ensuring that the child maintains frequent and continuing contact with each parent who has demonstrated the ability to act in the child’s best interests.  

---

### VII. REQUEST FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff **Samantha Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order;  

B. **Modify** the prior judgment to provide greater physical custody and parenting time to Plaintiff, including, at minimum, equal or substantially increased overnight time consistent with the child’s therapeutic recommendations and expressed wishes;  

C. **Direct** that the parties confer with a family service officer or mediator to establish a new, developmentally appropriate parenting schedule;  

D. **Grant such other and further relief** as this Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the child.  

---

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

Plaintiff prays that this Court enter a **Modified Custody Order** consistent with Emily Carter’s best interests, awarding Samantha Carter a shared or greater physical custodial role, maintaining shared legal custody, and providing a balanced and nurturing presence from both parents.  

---
