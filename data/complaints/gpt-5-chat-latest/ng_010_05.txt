### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Defendant is the owner and person in control of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).  
6. A large maple tree stood on or adjacent to Defendant’s property, with branches extending over the public sidewalk.  
7. For an extended period prior to July 15, 2023, one large branch of the tree appeared visibly cracked, drooping, and damaged.  
8. Neighbors, including Plaintiff, observed the hazardous condition and told Defendant about the cracked branch.  
9. Upon information and belief, Defendant acknowledged these concerns but declined to take immediate action, stating he would “deal with it in the spring.”  
10. Defendant failed to have the tree inspected, pruned, or removed despite reasonable notice and opportunity to do so.  
11. On July 15, 2023, during a routine summer thunderstorm, the compromised branch broke and fell onto the public sidewalk near 123 Maple Street.  
12. At approximately that time, Plaintiff was lawfully walking by the property carrying groceries.  
13. The branch struck Plaintiff on the right shoulder and upper back, knocking her to the ground.  
14. Plaintiff suffered physical injury, including a shoulder strain and extensive bruising.  
15. Plaintiff required medical evaluation and treatment, incurring expenses totaling approximately $2,500.  
16. Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week, resulting in lost wages of approximately $600.  
17. The incident caused Plaintiff pain, suffering, medical expenses, and emotional distress.  
18. Defendant’s negligence in maintaining his property and failing to address a known dangerous condition was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.

### **IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  
20. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner owes a duty of reasonable care to all persons lawfully on or adjacent to his property to prevent foreseeable harm from conditions under his control. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
21. This duty extends to conditions that pose a risk to persons using an adjacent public sidewalk. *Cohen v. Davies*, 305 Mass. 152 (1940).  
22. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the tree on his property in a reasonably safe condition and to take timely action when the branch became visibly cracked and hazardous. *Whiting v. City of Boston*, 106 Mass. 89 (1870).  
23. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the cracked branch posed an unreasonable risk of falling and injuring passersby, thereby breaching the duty of reasonable care. *Brown v. Kendall*, 6 Cush. 292 (Mass. 1850).  
24. Defendant’s failure to inspect or remove the dangerous branch constituted negligence and a breach of the duty owed to Plaintiff. *Soule v. Massachusetts Elec. Co.*, 378 Mass. 177 (1979).  
25. Defendant’s conduct was not that of a reasonably prudent homeowner under the same or similar circumstances. *Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1990).  
26. Plaintiff’s injuries were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent omission and failure to remedy the dangerous condition. *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988).  
27. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical harm, medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering. *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986).  
28. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition violated the applicable standard of care recognized in *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).  
29. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable for all damages proximately caused by his negligent acts or omissions. *Payton v. Abbott Labs.*, 386 Mass. 540 (1982).
