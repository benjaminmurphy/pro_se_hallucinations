### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)

Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, for her complaint against Defendant, Karen Reynolds, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851.  
2. Defendant **Karen Reynolds** (“Defendant”) is an individual and the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper under G.L. c. 218, §19 and §21 because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §2 because the Premises and events giving rise to this action occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a residential tenancy agreement beginning on or about **May 1, 2022**, under which Plaintiff rents the Premises for **$1,200 per month**.  
6. The Premises includes a bathroom with **no window** and a single **exhaust fan** for ventilation.  
7. Beginning in or around **June 2025**, mold growth appeared in the corner of the shower and subsequently spread to the bathroom ceiling.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold problem.  
9. Defendant inspected the bathroom, but rather than correcting the underlying defect, blamed Plaintiff, alleging that she took excessively hot showers and failed to run the fan often enough.  
10. Plaintiff ordinarily uses the bathroom exhaust fan when showering.  
11. Defendant has refused to make adequate repairs or to address the underlying ventilation problem that caused the mold.  
12. Plaintiff has suffered **respiratory illness, coughing, congestion, and wheezing** since the appearance of the mold. Her physician advised that the symptoms were likely mold-related and that professional remediation was necessary.  
13. Plaintiff was compelled to discard personal property (including towels and a shower curtain) damaged by mold, incurring approximately **$60** in replacement costs.  
14. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated requests, Defendant has not remediated the mold or improved the ventilation to prevent recurrence.  
15. Defendant’s actions and omissions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises and rendered it unhealthy and unsafe to occupy.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, any landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises is liable for damages.  
18. The **covenant of quiet enjoyment** protects tenants from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises caused by a landlord’s acts or omissions. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
19. Defendant had a statutory and common-law duty to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and to refrain from actions or inactions that substantially impair the character of the tenancy. *See* **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); **Hemingway v. Commonwealth**, 368 Mass. 425 (1975).  
20. The presence of mold and inadequate ventilation constitute a condition rendering the Premises unsafe and unfit for human habitation within the meaning of **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, **G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127L**, and applicable sanitary codes (105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.).  
21. Defendant’s failure to remediate the mold after notice constitutes a deliberate or negligent omission interfering with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 102–03; **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 718–19.  
22. The substantial interference with Plaintiff’s health and safety constitutes a breach even absent an eviction or express act of harassment. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
23. Defendant’s conduct was willful or, at a minimum, negligent, and caused Plaintiff personal discomfort, property loss, and emotional distress. *See* **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (upholding award for interference with quiet enjoyment for landlord’s failure to correct unsafe conditions); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
24. Defendant’s failure to maintain habitability and to comply with the State Sanitary Code also constitutes an unfair interference within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, §14** and **G.L. c. 111, §127L**. *See* **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  
25. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered damages including property loss of approximately **$60**, physical illness, pain, suffering, discomfort, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home. Plaintiff seeks a total of **$200** in damages.  
26. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any).

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **damages in the amount of $200**, or **three months’ rent ($3,600)**, whichever is greater, as required by statute;  
C. Award Plaintiff her **court costs and filing fees**;  
D. Order Defendant to **remediate and repair** the mold and ventilation problems in the bathroom to bring the Premises into compliance with the **State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000)**; and  
E. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
