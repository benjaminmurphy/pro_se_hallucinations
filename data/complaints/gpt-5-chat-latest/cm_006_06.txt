# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**Filed: December 1, 2025**

---

### **I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Emma Richardson** (“Petitioner”), resides in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. The Defendant, **Jacob Thompson** (“Respondent”), also resides within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the Barnstable County Probate and Family Court entered the existing judgment of custody and visitation on **June 15, 2021**.

3. The Petitioner brings this Complaint for Modification to obtain relief based on a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the existing custody order, specifically circumstances implicating the safety and welfare of the minor children.

### **II. PARTIES**

4. **Petitioner:** Emma Richardson, primary custodial parent of  
   - **Ava Thompson**, born [date], age 10  
   - **Lucas Thompson**, born [date], age 8  

   Residence: [Petitioner’s address withheld for privacy under Standing Order 1-15 Safe Address procedures, if applicable].  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com

5. **Respondent:** Jacob Thompson, non‑custodial parent who presently exercises parenting time on alternating weekends and one mid‑week visit as specified in the June 15, 2021 order.

---

### **III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

6. A Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time was entered by this Court on **June 15, 2021**, granting the Petitioner primary physical custody of the minor children and granting the Respondent parenting time on alternate weekends and one evening per week.

7. At the time of the judgment, both parties were single and neither was cohabiting with any third party.

8. No provision in the 2021 judgment addressed exposure of the children to unrelated adult household members or new romantic partners.

---

### **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

9. Since the entry of the 2021 custody judgment, substantial and material changes have occurred that adversely affect the welfare and best interests of the minor children.

10. Specifically, the Respondent has begun cohabiting with a romantic partner who has a **criminal record for assault and battery** and a **history of domestic violence**, including a **restraining order obtained by a former partner**.

11. The Petitioner has credible concerns for the safety and emotional well‑being of the children while in the Respondent’s home based on consistent statements made by the children.

12. The children have reported that the Respondent’s current partner frequently **yells**, **slams doors**, and once **grabbed one child hard enough to leave a visible mark** on the child’s arm.

13. A **neighbor contacted local law enforcement** following a loud argument at the Respondent’s home while the children were present.  

14. These incidents collectively demonstrate that the environment during the Respondent’s parenting time has become **volatile** and **unsafe**, thus constituting a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting judicial review under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**.

---

### **V. LEGAL STANDARD**

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a judgment of custody or visitation if the moving party proves (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (2) that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.  

16. See **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); **Miller v. Miller**, 478 Mass. 642 (2018); **Aragona v. Aragona**, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 518 (2012).  

17. The “best interests of the child” remain the paramount consideration in any custody modification. **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 838 (2003); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Rosen v. Rosen**, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016).  

18. A change exposing children to unsafe domestic environments constitutes a significant and material change. See **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986) (domestic violence and household instability justify modification); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (safety concerns are paramount).  

19. Massachusetts law mandates consideration of any history of abuse or violence in determining custody or visitation arrangements. **G.L. c. 208, § 31A**; **G.L. c. 209A, § 3**.  

20. A parent’s right to visitation may be restricted or conditioned where necessary to protect a child’s physical or emotional health. **Garside v. Garside**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 622 (2005); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

---

### **VI. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS**

21. The Respondent’s new cohabiting partner’s violent criminal background and the reported incidents of yelling, aggression, and physical contact with the minor child constitute circumstances that were not present or contemplated at the time of the 2021 custody judgment.

22. These developments satisfy the “material and substantial change in circumstances” requirement under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, as they directly affect the children’s safety and well‑being.  

23. The credible reports of physical aggression toward one child, the neighbor’s call to police, and the pattern of anger and intimidation within the Respondent’s household demonstrate a current environment inconsistent with the children’s best interests.

24. Allowing continued unsupervised visitation under these conditions exposes the children to risk of trauma and physical harm, contrary to the purpose of the custody arrangement.

25. It is therefore in the best interests of Ava and Lucas that the Court modify the existing order to impose protective conditions.

---

### **VII. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner, **Emma Richardson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the Judgment of June 15, 2021;

B. **Modify** the existing custody and visitation order so as to protect the best interests and safety of the minor children, and specifically:

   1. Order that the Respondent’s current cohabiting partner shall not be present during any parenting time with the minor children; **or**, in the alternative,  

   2. Order that all parenting time between the Respondent and the children be **supervised** by an agreed‑upon professional supervisor, neutral third‑party, or visitation center pending further order of the Court;

C. Issue any **interim orders** necessary to ensure the immediate safety of the children pending final adjudication;

D. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

---

I, **Emma Richardson**, hereby verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing representations are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.
