---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant to lease the premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts (“the Premises”).  

6. Plaintiff agreed to pay, and has paid, rent of $1,200 per month to Defendant.  

7. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in all Massachusetts residential leases under M.G.L. c. 186, §14 and the common law.  

8. Beginning approximately on or about November 10, 2025, the hot water system in the Premises failed, resulting in a complete loss of hot water.  

9. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the loss of hot water.  

10. Defendant informed Plaintiff that a part for the water heater was ordered; however, Defendant did not restore hot water service within a reasonable time.  

11. As of December 1, 2025, hot water has not been restored for more than three weeks.  

12. During this period, Plaintiff has been forced to bathe herself at a gym, incurring an additional monthly cost of $30, as well as related travel expenses, and to transport her infant child to her mother’s home to bathe the child.  

13. Plaintiff has been deprived of the use and enjoyment of her apartment, which is not fit for ordinary living without hot water.  

14. The loss of hot water constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  

15. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water service within a reasonable time constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

16. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff has suffered monetary and non-monetary damages, including inconvenience, discomfort, and out-of-pocket expenses, estimated at $400.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — M.G.L. c. 186, §14)**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  

18. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises, or who fails to maintain essential services such as hot water, is liable for damages.  

19. The loss of hot water for more than three weeks constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and renders the premises unfit for human habitation.  

20. The landlord’s failure to timely remedy the condition constitutes a violation of **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, notwithstanding Defendant’s asserted efforts, because the statute imposes strict liability for failure to maintain basic services. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

21. The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment arises both from statute and common law. See *Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.*, 340 Mass. 124 (1959); *Winthrop Realty Co. v. Commissioner of Corps. & Taxation*, 297 Mass. 471 (1937).  

22. The absence of hot water violates the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. 410.190**, which requires landlords to supply hot water of at least 110°F. The violation of the sanitary code constitutes evidence of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 978 (1983).  

23. The landlord’s unreasonable delay in repairing or replacing essential equipment has been held to breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  

24. Courts have found that lack of heat or hot water substantially interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Darmetko v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 378 Mass. 758 (1979).  

25. Plaintiff’s inability to use hot water services, combined with the inconveniences and expenses incurred, meet the threshold for a substantial interference as defined in *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), and *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).  

26. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (though Plaintiff proceeds pro se).  

27. Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $400, or such greater sum as the Court finds equitable under the statute.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Rivera** respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. Award actual damages in the amount of **$400**, or treble rent damages as permitted by statute;  
C. Award reasonable costs of this action pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
