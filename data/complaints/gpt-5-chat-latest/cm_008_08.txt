**RACHEL THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON**,  
Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, and respectfully files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody judgment entered by this Court on **May 15, 2022**, and for grounds states as follows:

---

## **PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, resides in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, **Samantha Johnson**, age 10.

2. The Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, resides in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, **Samantha Johnson**.

3. The minor child, **Samantha Johnson**, currently resides primarily with the Plaintiff pursuant to the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered by this Court on **May 15, 2022**.

---

## **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the original custody judgment was issued by the Suffolk County Probate and Family Court, and both parties and the minor child continue to reside within its jurisdiction.  

5. Venue is proper in the Suffolk Division of the Probate and Family Court under **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 82** and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**.

---

## **FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. The Judgment of **May 15, 2022**, granted the parties **joint legal custody** of the minor child, **Samantha Johnson**, with the Plaintiff as the **primary residential parent**.  

7. The Defendant was granted significant parenting time, including **weekend overnights from Friday through Sunday evening**, with the child returning to the Plaintiff’s care on **Monday mornings**.

8. At the time of the entry of that judgment, Samantha was performing well academically and had good school attendance.

9. Since approximately **September 2024**, the Defendant has repeatedly failed to ensure that Samantha attends school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time. The Defendant regularly keeps Samantha home, claiming she “needs a mental health day,” despite the absence of medical documentation or professional recommendations supporting such absences.

10. This repeated failure to return the child to school as scheduled has resulted in **multiple truancy warnings** from the school district. Samantha’s **grades and standardized test scores have significantly declined** over the past academic year.

11. The Defendant has also **refused to take Samantha to scheduled tutoring sessions** during his parenting weekends, in contravention of the parties’ duty under the judgment to cooperate regarding educational matters.

12. As a result of the Defendant’s ongoing behavior, the child’s **academic progress and attendance have materially deteriorated**, and the Plaintiff has been unable to ensure her child’s regular attendance due to the existing order’s allocation of decision-making and parenting time.

13. These developments constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the prior judgment and **adversely affect the child’s best interests**.

---

## **LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITY**

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a judgment respecting the custody of minor children upon a showing that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred and that the modification is **necessary in the best interests of the child**. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

15. The “best interests of the child” standard governs custody determinations. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 845 (2003); *Boucher v. Boucher*, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 918 (1995).

16. A parent’s **failure to ensure school attendance** and interference with educational needs is a recognized basis for custody modification. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

17. The obligation of joint legal custodians to **cooperate on educational matters** is well established. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010). Where cooperation breaks down to the detriment of the child, modification is warranted. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

18. Courts also recognize that a parent’s **persistent disregard for court orders or the child’s welfare** may justify granting one parent final decision-making authority. *Mazzone v. Mazzone*, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 345 (2002); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).

19. In addition, under **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60(b)** and related jurisprudence, when material facts have changed, modification of the custody order may be necessary to ensure that the order remains consistent with present circumstances. *G.B. v. C.A.*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 389 (2018).

20. The Court’s equitable power under **G.L. c. 215, § 6** further authorizes appropriate relief to protect the best interests of the minor child when material change has been demonstrated. *Adoption of Vito*, 431 Mass. 550, 563 (2000); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

## **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor child since the entry of the prior judgment;

B. **Modify** the Judgment of Custody entered on **May 15, 2022**, to ensure the child’s educational attendance and stability, specifically by one or more of the following means:

   1. Granting the Plaintiff **final legal decision-making authority regarding educational and school attendance matters**, or  
   2. Modifying the Defendant’s parenting time so that the child’s time with the Defendant concludes **no later than Sunday evening at 7:00 p.m.**, ensuring consistent Monday school attendance;

C. Order the Defendant to **ensure the minor child’s attendance at all scheduled tutoring, school, and enrichment programs**, whether or not they fall during his parenting time;

D. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to serve the **best interests of the child** under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and applicable Massachusetts law.

---

## **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Court:

1. Modify the existing custody order consistent with the best interests of **Samantha Johnson**;  
2. Hold that the Defendant’s continued failure to ensure school attendance constitutes a material change in circumstances;  
3. Adjust the Defendant’s parenting time or the scope of joint legal custody accordingly; and  
4. Grant such further relief as justice and equity may require.
