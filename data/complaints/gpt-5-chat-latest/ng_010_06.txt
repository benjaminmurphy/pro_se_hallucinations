### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant John Smith (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.  

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant John Smith is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201.  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as it involves a tort claim with damages exceeding $25,000 exclusive of interest and costs.  

4. Venue is proper in Berkshire County under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the defendant resides in this county and the incident giving rise to this action occurred here.  

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. Plaintiff regularly walks along the public sidewalk in front of Defendant’s property located at or near 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  

6. For an extended period prior to August 15, 2023, there existed on Defendant’s property a large, mature maple tree with branches extending over the public sidewalk.  

7. One major overhanging branch of said tree was visibly cracked, drooping, and in deteriorating condition.  

8. Local residents, including neighbors of Defendant, observed and noted the hazardous condition of the branch and communicated their concerns to Defendant, suggesting that it be examined or removed by a professional.  

9. Defendant acknowledged those concerns and stated that he would “deal with it in the spring” but failed to take any steps to remove, trim, or otherwise make safe the dangerous limb.  

10. On or about August 15, 2023, during a routine summer thunderstorm of moderate force, the cracked branch broke off and struck Plaintiff as she was walking lawfully on the public sidewalk in front of Defendant’s property.  

11. The falling branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, knocking her to the pavement and causing injury.  

12. As a result of Defendant’s failure to maintain his property in a reasonably safe condition, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $1,200, and lost approximately $600 in wages due to missed work.  

13. Plaintiff has continued to experience discomfort, limited mobility, and emotional distress resulting from the incident.  

---

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE  

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as though fully set forth herein.  

15. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, and was responsible for the maintenance of the premises at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield.  

16. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain his property, including trees and branches overhanging the public way, in a condition that would not present an unreasonable risk of harm to persons lawfully using adjacent public sidewalks. *See* **G.L. c. 84, §§ 1 & 15**; **Anderson v. Kopelman**, 279 Mass. 140 (1932); **Fleming v. City of Springfield**, 154 Mass. 520 (1891).  

17. Landowners in Massachusetts are responsible for ensuring that trees and appurtenances on their property do not pose foreseeable risks to travelers on adjacent public ways. *See* **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 416 Mass. 825 (1994); **Roman v. Boston**, 423 Mass. 629 (1996); **Jones v. Hayden**, 310 Mass. 90 (1941).  

18. Defendant knew or should have known that the cracked and drooping limb was in a hazardous condition likely to fall and injure passersby, yet failed to inspect, prune, or remove it. *See* **Gillis v. Boston**, 445 Mass. 59 (2005); **Hannon v. Waterbury**, 106 Mass. 178 (1870).  

19. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable care to remove or repair the dangerous condition breached the duty owed to persons such as Plaintiff. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing distinctions between licensees and invitees for duty of reasonable care).  

20. The harm to Plaintiff was a foreseeable and direct result of Defendant’s breach. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (foreseeability governs scope of duty).  

21. Defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages. *See* **Kent v. Commonwealth**, 437 Mass. 312 (2002).  

22. As a result of Defendant’s wrongful conduct, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, pain and suffering, lost wages, medical expenses, and emotional distress, for which she is entitled to compensatory damages.  

---

### IV. DAMAGES  

23. Plaintiff’s economic damages include approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and $600 in lost wages.  

24. Plaintiff also seeks general damages for physical pain, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.  

25. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform with evidence of additional damages, including any ongoing medical treatment or pain and suffering, pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 15**.  

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, and order the following relief:

A. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, believed to exceed $25,000;  
B. Recovery of costs, interest, and allowable fees pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6C;  
C. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  

Pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**, Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
