Civil Action No. __________

### COMPLAINT  
*(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)*  

---

#### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Kevin Thompson** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Unit ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.  
2. The Defendant, **Lydia Grant** (“Defendant”), upon information and belief, is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.  

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, specifically Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14, governing a landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Cambridge District Court** pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19 and §21, as the rental premises are located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.  

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the apartment at **123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA**, beginning **January 15, 2022**, at a monthly rent of **$2,500**.  
6. At all relevant times, the Defendant was the landlord of the premises and was responsible for maintaining the habitability and peaceful enjoyment of the leased unit pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14 and Massachusetts common law.  
7. Beginning approximately **October 1, 2025**, Defendant caused, allowed, or authorized extensive renovation and construction work in the adjoining unit to Plaintiff’s apartment.  
8. Said construction has produced continuous **loud noise** from drilling, hammering, and power tools, as well as loud conversation among workers between the hours of **8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M.**, Mondays through Fridays.  
9. The construction has continued for approximately **two months** and, as of the filing of this Complaint, Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the work is expected to continue for an additional one to two months.  
10. Dust and debris from the adjacent construction have infiltrated Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system, creating both discomfort and potential health concerns.  
11. Plaintiff works from home and requires a quiet environment to conduct professional calls and perform job duties.  
12. The ongoing disturbance and dust infiltration have severely interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises and have substantially impaired the beneficial enjoyment of the apartment.  
13. Defendant acknowledged the disturbance and offered Plaintiff a **$100 rent reduction for one month**, which Plaintiff accepted under protest.  
14. The offered reduction does not adequately compensate for the interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy, which has been continuous, disruptive, and detrimental to Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
15. Plaintiff has remained current on rent payments and has made every reasonable effort to cooperate and communicate with Defendant.  
16. Despite notice and opportunity to remedy, Defendant has failed to take sufficient steps to mitigate the ongoing interference, such as installing sound barriers, limiting hours further, sealing vents, or providing alternative accommodations.

#### IV. COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
*(Violation of M.G.L. c. 186, §14 and Massachusetts Common Law)*

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of any residential tenant.  
19. Defendant’s conduct in permitting or facilitating highly disruptive construction activities and allowing dust and noise to penetrate Plaintiff’s apartment constitutes an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
20. Said interference was substantial and continuous, amounting to more than a mere annoyance or inconvenience, and directly impaired Plaintiff’s beneficial use of the premises.  
21. Under **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)**, a landlord is liable under G.L. c. 186, §14 for acts or omissions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s enjoyment, regardless of the landlord’s intent.  
22. In **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)**, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord may be liable for noise disturbances caused by third parties when the landlord could reasonably have foreseen and controlled the interference.  
23. The Defendant was at all times aware of and responsible for the construction, had the power to control the activities causing the disturbance, and therefore bears liability pursuant to **Blackett**.  
24. Massachusetts courts have held that even temporary interferences may constitute violations if they are substantial in nature and impact, see **Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**.  
25. Similar findings have been made where renovation-related dust, vibration, and noise deprived tenants of peaceful occupancy (see **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979)**).  
26. Under Massachusetts case law, including **Simon v. Solomon, supra**, and **Winchester v. O'Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929)**, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached where a landlord’s acts or omissions substantially disturb the tenant’s comfort, repose, or enjoyment of the leased premises.  
27. The statutory remedy under **G.L. c. 186, §14** allows for recovery of actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.  
28. Plaintiff has suffered loss, distress, inconvenience, and inability to fully use the premises as a dwelling, entitling him to damages under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, as interpreted in **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, 417 Mass. 273 (1994)**.  
29. The Defendant’s failure to mitigate demonstrates disregard for Plaintiff’s rights and obligations under **G.L. c. 93A** may also inform the assessment of reasonableness, see **Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855 (1991)**, though this complaint asserts only quiet enjoyment.  
30. As further precedent, see **Joyce v. Hickey, 337 Mass. 118 (1958)** (recognizing landlord’s liability for interference with tenant’s beneficial use), **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997)** (holding landlord responsible for failure to maintain habitable conditions), and **Manzaro v. McCann, 401 Mass. 880 (1988)** (requiring compensation for breach of quiet enjoyment).

#### V. DAMAGES

31. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages estimated at **$1,500**, representing the loss of value, distress, and inconvenience resulting from the noisy, dusty, and disruptive conditions.  
32. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to the greater of three months’ rent (three times $2,500 = $7,500) or actual damages, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, as the Court deems just.  

---

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and adjudge that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff **statutory damages** of $7,500 or, alternatively, **actual damages** in the amount of $1,500, whichever is greater;  
C. Award **reasonable attorney’s fees and costs**, as allowed by statute;  
D. Grant such **further relief** as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

#### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
