---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a duplex at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway.  
7. Defendant owned and maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder which he regularly left leaning unsecured against a wooden fence adjacent to the shared driveway.  
8. Plaintiff expressed concern to Defendant on at least two separate occasions prior to March 15, 2023, that the ladder appeared unstable and could fall, causing property damage or injury.  
9. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and assured her he would either secure or relocate the ladder but failed to take any remedial action.  
10. On or about March 15, 2023, a windy day, Plaintiff was backing her vehicle—a passenger car—into the driveway when a gust of wind toppled the unsecured ladder.  
11. The ladder fell onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s car, denting the hood and cracking the windshield.  
12. Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained significant damage requiring professional body repair and windshield replacement.  
13. Plaintiff paid an insurance deductible and incurred expenses associated with vehicle repair and rental during the repair period exceeding one week.  
14. The damage to Plaintiff’s property was directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence in failing to properly secure or store the ladder despite prior notice of the foreseeable risk of harm.

### III. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 14 as though fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, a duty of reasonable care is imposed upon all persons to act to prevent foreseeable injury to others arising from their conduct. *See* **G.L. c. 231, § 85**; *Jescrome Realty Co. v. Northeast Airlines, Inc.*, 195 N.E.2d 379 (Mass. 1964).  
17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances—to secure his personal property (the ladder) so as not to pose an unreasonable risk of harm to persons or property lawfully using the shared driveway. *See* *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing common-law categories and holding land possessors owe reasonable care to lawful visitors).  
18. Defendant breached that duty by permitting an unsecured aluminum extension ladder to remain propped against a fence adjacent to a shared driveway, despite knowing and being warned of the hazard it presented. *See* *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1987) (failure to correct known dangerous condition constitutes breach).  
19. Defendant’s acts and omissions were unreasonable under the circumstances and demonstrated disregard for foreseeable harm. *See* *Crone v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 269 Mass. 289 (1929) (foreseeability of harm is central to negligence).  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage to her vehicle, expenses for repair and rental, and incidental financial losses. *See* *Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302A* (adopted in *Jescrome Realty Co.*, supra).  
21. Plaintiff’s damages were foreseeable because unsecured objects, such as ladders, are likely to fall and cause damage when exposed to strong winds. *See* *Leavitt v. Mizner*, 404 Mass. 81 (1989) (defendant liable when failure to remove foreseeable hazard causes damage).  
22. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to the filing of this action.  
23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence within the meaning of Massachusetts law. *See* *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000) (failure to act reasonably to avoid foreseeable risk of harm establishes negligence).  
24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover for the full measure of property damage and associated expenses caused by Defendant’s negligent act or omission, consistent with *Katon v. Massachusetts Turnpike Auth.*, 2 Mass. App. Ct. 577 (1974), and *McGuiggan v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co.*, 398 Mass. 152 (1986).

### IV. DAMAGES

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:
   a. Physical damage to her vehicle, including dents to the hood and a shattered windshield;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses for repair and replacement of the windshield totaling an amount to be proved at trial;  
   c. Payment of her insurance deductible;  
   d. Rental car costs incurred while her vehicle was being repaired; and  
   e. Other incidental expenses and losses flowing naturally from the occurrence.  

26. Plaintiff did not suffer personal physical injury or medical expenses; however, her property damage and related economic losses are compensable. *See* *Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co.*, 407 Mass. 185 (1990) (economic losses recoverable where caused by negligent conduct leading to property damage).

---

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;  
B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to exceed $25,000;  
C. Award costs, interest, and reasonable attorney’s fees as authorized by law under **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**.
