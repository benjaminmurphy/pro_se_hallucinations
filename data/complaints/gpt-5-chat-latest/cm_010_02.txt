### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §28, G.L. c. 209C, §20, and G.L. c. 215, §6)

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson,** and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a **Complaint for Modification** of the existing custody order concerning the minor child, **Sophie Smith**, currently age ten (10). In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Emily Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Smith.  
   Telephone: (617) 555-0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** David Smith, also residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the father of the minor child, Sophie Smith.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper under **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, §28**, and related provisions under **G.L. c. 215, §6**, granting the Probate and Family Court continuing jurisdiction to revise or modify prior custody judgments.  

4. Venue in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** is proper because the original Judgment of Custody and Visitation was entered in this Court on **May 15, 2016**, and both parties and the minor child reside within Bristol County.

---

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

5. On **May 15, 2016**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody granting **primary physical custody** of Sophie Smith to the Defendant, David Smith, with limited visitation rights to the Plaintiff, consisting of **weekend visitation** and one **weekday dinner**.  

6. That arrangement was based on circumstances existing at the time—specifically, that the Plaintiff was pursuing graduate studies, lived in a small studio apartment, and worked an inflexible schedule.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the prior Judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** concerning both the Plaintiff and the welfare and best interests of the minor child.  

8. The Plaintiff has **completed graduate school**, obtained **stable, full-time employment with regular hours**, and now resides in a **two-bedroom apartment** where Sophie has her own bedroom.  

9. Sophie has grown older (now age ten) and her developmental and emotional needs have evolved since the entry of the original order.  

10. Sophie’s therapist has reported that Sophie experiences **distress, guilt, and sadness** when her short visits with her mother end, and the therapist supports expanding Sophie’s time with the Plaintiff.  

11. Sophie has written a letter to this Honorable Court expressing her desire for additional overnights and more frequent time with her mother.  

12. The Defendant has refused reasonable discussions regarding Schedule adjustments and has become **angry** when the subject is raised, creating unnecessary stress for Sophie.  

13. These changes collectively reflect a **substantial and continuing change** in the material circumstances that directly affect the child’s best interests, warranting modification of the prior custody and parenting-time order.  

---

### V. LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITIES

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, §28**, a judgment relative to custody may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that the modification is in the **best interests of the child**.  

15. Massachusetts case law holds that modification is appropriate when “conditions upon which the earlier judgment was based have materially changed” and “the welfare of the child would be advanced by the proposed modification.” — *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

16. The Court’s paramount consideration is always the **best interests of the child**. — *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

17. A change in a parent’s stability, housing, and work schedule constitutes a “material change” under *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

18. Evidence of the child’s emotional needs, attachments, and developmental stage is central to assessing best interests. — *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  

19. When a parent demonstrates the ability to provide a stable, nurturing environment, increased custodial access may promote the child’s well-being. — *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

20. Parental cooperation and communication are relevant to custody determinations. — *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).  

21. The Court may consider the child’s wishes, especially when the child is mature enough to express them meaningfully. — *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987).  

22. Therapy findings and recommendations are valid considerations in modification proceedings. — *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

23. Continuing conflict that causes harm to the child may warrant modification to reduce stress and promote stability. — *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).  

24. The requested modification is consistent with the principles articulated in the above authorities and in *G.L. c. 209C, §20*, which authorizes modification based on substantial changes affecting the child’s welfare.

### VI. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior custody judgment entered May 15, 2016;  

B. Find that it is in the **best interests of the minor child, Sophie Smith**, to modify the current custody and parenting schedule;  

C. Modify the current Judgment to provide for **shared physical custody** or, at minimum, significantly **expanded parenting time** for the Plaintiff, including additional overnights and equitable weekday and weekend time;  

D. Grant such further relief as this Honorable Court deems **just and proper**.
