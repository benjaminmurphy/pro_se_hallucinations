It does not address, much less establish, a specific duty to secure a ladder or other personal property in a shared driveway, nor does it articulate the concrete standard of care described in the proposition. Therefore, this citation does not support the claimed duty about securing personal property in the manner asserted.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential. This tends to perpetuate, although on a smaller scale, the kind of tradition-bound and mistaken analysis that I had supposed the court was aiming to correct.\""

The court\u2019s holding is that the particular incident was not reasonably foreseeable and thus no duty was breached, which is the opposite of asserting that a defendant breached a duty in the ladder scenario described.

The opinion explains the elements of negligence under Massachusetts law and applies them to conclude that plaintiffs could not show the defendant\u2019s conduct caused their injuries. Thus, the case is authority for the insufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence showing, not for the proposition that the defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent.",
