3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as this action arises from a landlord-tenant relationship within the Court’s geographic jurisdiction.  

4. Venue lies properly in the Somerville District Court because the rental property that is the subject of this dispute is located in Somerville, Massachusetts.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 45 Beacon Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).  

6. Under the lease terms, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent of **$1,800**.  

7. The lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to the covenanted right of **quiet enjoyment** of the premises.  

8. Approximately six months ago, new tenants moved into the apartment immediately above Plaintiff’s unit, also owned and leased by Defendant.  

9. Since the arrival of the upstairs tenants, Plaintiff has experienced **constant and excessive noise**, including loud music, heavy footsteps, and furniture being moved late at night, occurring at all hours.  

10. Plaintiff approached the upstairs tenants directly and requested that they keep the noise to a reasonable level. The tenants temporarily reduced the noise but resumed disruptive activities within days.  

11. Plaintiff subsequently complained to Defendant on at least **five to six separate occasions** over the past six months, seeking Defendant’s intervention to enforce the lease provisions and to remedy the interference.  

12. Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants once but refused to take further action, telling Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”  

13. The disturbances have persisted nightly, depriving Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of her home, causing stress, lack of sleep, and significant deterioration of her quality of life.  

14. As a direct result, Plaintiff’s health and professional life have suffered: she received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk, began taking prescribed sleep medication costing approximately **$40 per month**, and continues to experience sleep deprivation and emotional distress.  

15. Plaintiff purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranged her bedroom furniture in attempts to mitigate the noise, but these measures proved ineffective.  

16. Defendant has not taken any reasonable or effective steps to abate the problem or otherwise ensure Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the premises.

17. As a result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of approximately **$2,000**, in addition to ongoing emotional and physical consequences.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under **Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, section 14**, it is unlawful for a landlord, either directly or indirectly through neglect or omission, to interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  

20. Defendant had a duty under both statute and the lease to maintain the Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment and to take reasonable measures to prevent substantial interference caused by other tenants or conditions under his control.  

21. The repeated loud noise and disturbances from Defendant’s other tenants constituted a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home for its intended purposes.  

22. Defendant’s failure to act meaningfully despite multiple complaints constitutes an **omission** proscribed by G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 719 (1977) (landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where disturbances by other tenants under landlord’s control interfered with tenant’s use); **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 101 (1982) (breach may arise from landlord’s failure to act to correct interference within their control); **A.J. Kimball Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co.**, 288 Mass. 422 (1934); **Coveney v. President & Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross**, 388 Mass. 16, 18 (1983); **Lowell Housing Auth. v. Melendez**, 449 Mass. 34, 41 (2007).  

23. Massachusetts law recognizes that continuous, unreasonable noise may constitute substantial interference amounting to breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); **Leardi v. Brown**, 394 Mass. 151 (1985); **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); **Williams v. Seder**, 306 Mass. 134 (1940).  

24. Defendant’s inaction directly caused Plaintiff to lose the beneficial use of her apartment, suffering loss of sleep, stress, and expense.  

25. Plaintiff’s damages were foreseeable and directly caused by Defendant’s failure to fulfill his statutory and contractual obligations.  

26. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment** entitling Plaintiff to damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to actual damages, statutory damages, and attorney’s fees where applicable.

### V. DAMAGES

27. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages of approximately **$2,000**, including but not limited to:  
   - Out-of-pocket costs for mitigation efforts (white noise machine, earplugs, medication);  
   - Emotional distress and sleep deprivation;  
   - Loss of work performance and associated repercussions.  

28. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **statutory damages of not less than one month’s rent**, in addition to actual damages and costs.
