# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION (CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME)**

---

### **I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, respectfully brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28; ch. 209C, § 20; and ch. 215, § 6*, seeking a modification of the existing custody and parenting order entered by this Honorable Court on **May 15, 2020**.  

2. The Norfolk Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter under *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28*, as the parties' minor children reside within this Court’s jurisdiction and the original judgment was issued by this Court.

---

### **II. PARTIES**

3. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Turner, mother of the minor children Liam Turner (age 8) and Ava Turner (age 6), primary custodial parent. Address and contact information are on file with the Court.  

4. **Defendant:** Michael Turner, father of the minor children, who currently exercises parenting time pursuant to the Court’s May 15, 2020 judgment.

---

### **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

5. On **May 15, 2020**, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order granting Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the minor children, with Defendant having parenting time **every other weekend and one overnight during the week**.  

6. At the time of the original judgment, both parties maintained consistent daytime employment schedules, which allowed Defendant to exercise his overnight parenting time in a stable and consistent manner.

7. Since the entry of that judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that directly affects the children’s welfare and renders the existing parenting time schedule no longer in their best interests.

8. Specifically, Defendant has changed employment and now works **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** shifts on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights that coincide with his court-ordered overnight parenting schedule.

9. Due to these work hours, Defendant is frequently **unable to personally care for the children** during his scheduled parenting time. He has often **dropped the children off at Plaintiff’s home with minimal notice** or, alternatively, **left them in the care of his adult roommate**, who is unfamiliar to Plaintiff and not an appropriate caregiver for the children overnight.

10. The children, Liam and Ava, have reported that on several occasions they **fell asleep on the couch while Defendant slept after completing his overnight shifts**, indicating a lack of appropriate supervision and rest.

11. Defendant’s irregular work schedule and reliance on third parties for overnight care have caused confusion, inconsistency, and distress for the children and have undermined the stable routine contemplated by the original judgment.

12. The Plaintiff has consistently made herself available to care for the children when Defendant has been unable to do so, ensuring their safety, consistency in routine, and school attendance.

13. Plaintiff is seeking a modification **only as necessary to reflect Defendant’s current work schedule**, specifically to limit overnights to occasions when Defendant is available and not scheduled to work overnight.

---

### **IV. LEGAL STANDARD AND ARGUMENT**

14. Under *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28*, a custody or parenting time order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and when such modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  

15. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a significant change in a parent’s circumstances—especially those affecting availability and stability for children—warrants modification.  See, e.g.:

   - *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) – A substantial change in circumstances affecting welfare of the child supports modification.  
   - *Buker v. Buker*, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 845 (1980) – Custody may be modified when a parent’s change in work schedule materially affects the children’s care.  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) – The court’s primary consideration is always the children’s best interests.  
   - *D. v. C.*, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 132 (1991) – Stability and predictability in parental care are central to the best interest analysis.  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) – A consistent and safe parenting environment is crucial in assessing modification requests.  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) – Material change standard liberally interpreted when circumstances substantially impact parenting.  
   - *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) – Courts weigh a parent’s ability to meet the daily needs of the children.  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) – Courts consider each parent’s capacity for providing stability and emotional support.  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) – The parenting arrangement must reflect the practical realities of each parent’s availability.  
   - *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, §§ 28 & 31;* *ch. 209C, § 20;* and *Probate & Family Court Standing Order 1-17*.

16. Defendant’s overnight employment schedule constitutes a **material change** because it disrupts his ability to provide consistent and direct care during designated overnight visits.

17. Maintaining the current schedule would not serve the children’s best interests, as it subjects them to sporadic care, uncertainty, and exposure to third-party supervision rather than parental attention.

18. The requested modification would promote stability, safety, and predictability by aligning parenting time with Defendant’s actual availability.

### **V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the May 15, 2020 custody order;  
2. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting time order to provide that Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur **only on nights when Defendant is not scheduled to work or on designated weekends when he is available**;  
3. **Confirm** Plaintiff’s primary physical custody of the minor children, with reasonable parenting time for Defendant consistent with his current employment schedule;  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
