### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

#### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff** Cameron Lee (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130. Plaintiff is a lawful tenant of the premises described below.  

2. **Defendant** Jordan McCarthy (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This action arises under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  

4. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the **Boston Housing Court Department** pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, because the premises are located within the city of Boston and the cause of action arises from a tenancy in that jurisdiction.

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant for a studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts (“the Premises”), at a monthly rent of $1,500.  

6. During the initial showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the Premises and inquired about them. Defendant represented that the stains were the result of an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”  

7. Shortly after Plaintiff took possession, the first major rainstorm caused water to leak through the same area in the ceiling. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the problem.  

8. Despite repeated notice, Defendant failed and refused to make adequate repairs and dismissed the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue.”  

9. Over time, the leak worsened. During one storm, water penetrated the ceiling and wall, soaking Plaintiff’s couch and destroying a laptop computer valued at approximately $900.  

10. The ongoing moisture has created a persistent musty odor and conditions conducive to mold growth. Plaintiff has experienced headaches and other physical discomfort, which Plaintiff reasonably attributes to these unhealthy living conditions.  

11. The bed has had to be moved away from the affected area, forcing Plaintiff to live in only half of the studio and depriving Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

12. Defendant’s repeated failure to address the leak and water intrusion, despite Plaintiff’s notice and complaints, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered property damage, inconvenience, embarrassment, discomfort, and other consequential harms valued at not less than $900.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(**G.L. c. 186, § 14**)

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 13 above.  

15. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for actual and consequential damages or statutory damages of not less than one month’s rent, and may also be responsible for the tenant’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  

16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every lease or tenancy at will under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714** (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91** (1982).  

17. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord’s failure to act allows a condition on the property to substantially impair the character and value of the leased premises. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273** (1994); *Winchester v. O’Brien*, **266 Mass. 33** (1929).  

18. Persistent water leaks, dampness, and mold constitute substantial interferences with the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises. See *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91** (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847** (1997)).  

19. Defendant was notified of the leaks and resulting water damage on multiple occasions but failed to take reasonable and timely steps to correct the defects, thereby violating Plaintiff’s statutory and contractual right to quiet enjoyment.  

20. Defendant’s conduct constitutes “interference” within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, as interpreted in *Blackett v. Olanoff*, supra, and *Habit Management Institute, Inc. v. Davis*, **29 Mass. App. Ct. 9** (1990).  

21. Defendant’s continued neglect and dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaints, after repeated notice, constitutes willful or knowing interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman*, **417 Mass. 771** (1994).  

22. In addition to the statutory violation, these conditions breach the implied warranty of habitability recognized in *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, **363 Mass. 184** (1973), and form the factual basis for the statutory claim under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

23. Under *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, **410 Mass. 855** (1991), a landlord is strictly liable under § 14 for any act or omission that substantially interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment, even if motivated by negligence rather than malice.  

24. Defendant’s ongoing failure to remedy the leaks and attendant moisture constitutes such an interference, justifying recovery of at least one month’s rent and compensatory damages.

#### V. DAMAGES

25. As a direct result of Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:  
   a. Property loss valued at approximately $900 (damaged laptop and furniture);  
   b. Loss of use of a substantial portion of the apartment;  
   c. Physical discomfort and health symptoms attributable to poor conditions; and  
   d. Stress and inconvenience caused by persistent disruption of habitability.  

26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, or, in the alternative, statutory damages equal to at least one month’s rent ($1,500), whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if later retained counsel).

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Enter judgment for Plaintiff against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
2. Award Plaintiff damages of at least $900, or alternatively one month’s rent ($1,500), whichever is greater;  
3. Award Plaintiff court costs and any other relief deemed just and proper;  
4. Grant such further equitable and legal relief as the Court finds appropriate.
