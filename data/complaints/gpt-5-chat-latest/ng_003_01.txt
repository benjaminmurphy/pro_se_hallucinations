---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful customer at Defendant’s store located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  
7. Defendant, through its employees, agents, and managers, owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, stacking, and display of merchandise to prevent foreseeable harm to customers lawfully on the premises. (*See* *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 362 Mass. 165, 167 (1972)).  
8. Defendant had stacked large and heavy boxes of kitchen appliances—approximately five or six boxes high—on metal shelving without proper restraints, barriers, or securing measures.  
9. Such stacking created an unreasonable risk that the boxes would fall with minimal vibration or contact.  
10. While Plaintiff was examining merchandise in the aisle, another customer, while exercising ordinary care, pushed a shopping cart that lightly contacted a shelf.  
11. The vibration caused a heavy **toaster-oven box** from near the top of the stack to fall, striking Plaintiff on his **right shoulder and the side of his head**.  
12. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness, head pain, and discomfort in his shoulder.  
13. Defendant’s store manager observed the incident, prepared an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon instead of assistance for medical attention.  
14. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened; he sought medical treatment at a local emergency department, where he was diagnosed with a **mild concussion** and **right shoulder strain**.  
15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses and lost approximately **$1,200** in wages because he was unable to perform his job as a delivery driver for several days.  
16. Plaintiff also endured pain, headaches, dizziness, and restricted shoulder mobility for several weeks and was unable to participate in normal recreational activities, including his weekly soccer league, for about one month.  
17. Defendant’s careless stacking practices and failure to provide restraints or safer shelving directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries.

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under *G.L. c. 231, § 85*, every person or entity conducting activities in the Commonwealth owes a duty to act with reasonable care under the circumstances.  
20. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee lawfully on the premises, a duty to maintain the store in a reasonably safe condition and to protect him from foreseeable injury. (*See* *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 385 (2010)).  
21. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
    a. Stacking heavy items at unsafe heights without securing mechanisms;  
    b. Failing to inspect and correct hazardous display conditions;  
    c. Failing to warn customers of the risk that merchandise could fall; and  
    d. Failing to adopt reasonable shelving and safety standards.  
22. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s concussion, shoulder strain, and related damages. (*See* *Coughlin v. T.M. Holmes & Co.*, 310 Mass. 458, 460 (1941); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006)).  
23. Plaintiff’s injuries were a foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to secure heavy boxes appropriately. (*See* *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996)).  
24. Plaintiff did not contribute negligently to his injuries and acted with reasonable care at all times. (*See* *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401, 408 (1991)).  
25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, emotional distress, lost wages, medical expenses, and loss of enjoyment of life. (*See* *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 557 (1982); *Aleksov v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 421 Mass. 655, 657 (1996)).
