### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Lee**, and respectfully complains and says as follows:

---

### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This action is brought pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, which authorizes the Probate and Family Court to modify a judgment concerning the custody of a minor child upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where such modification serves the best interests of the child.  

2. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court**, as the parties and the minor child, **Emily Smith**, reside within this county.  

3. The original custody judgment was entered by this Court on **May 15, 2022**, and remains in effect.

---

### II. PARTIES

4. The Plaintiff, **Jennifer Lee**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of **Emily Smith**, age 10, born [date omitted for privacy].  

5. The Defendant, **Michael Smith**, also resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Pursuant to the existing custody judgment entered on May 15, 2022, the parties share **joint legal custody** of Emily, with Plaintiff serving as the **primary residential parent** and Defendant entitled to **substantial weekend parenting time**, including overnight stays on Sunday nights.  

7. The judgment further requires the parties to cooperate on Emily’s school and educational matters, to share information regarding her progress, and to make joint decisions concerning her education and extracurricular activities.  

8. At the time the judgment entered, Emily was performing well academically and had satisfactory attendance.  

9. Over the past year, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred. Defendant has repeatedly failed to ensure Emily’s attendance at school on Mondays following his weekends, claiming that Emily “needs a mental health day.”  

10. Defendant has not provided any medical documentation, counseling recommendations, or school-approved reason to justify these repeated absences.  

11. As a result, Emily has accumulated multiple unexcused absences and tardies, prompting formal truancy warnings from her school.  

12. Emily’s academic performance has declined significantly, including lower test scores, missed assignments, and reduced participation in tutoring programs—particularly those scheduled during Defendant’s custodial time.  

13. Defendant has refused or failed to transport Emily to her scheduled tutoring sessions that occur during his custodial weekends, despite repeated requests and the school’s recommendations.  

14. Plaintiff has made good-faith efforts to communicate and cooperate with Defendant regarding these issues, but Defendant has stated that he believes Emily “needs breaks” and has declined to modify his approach.  

15. Plaintiff avers that this continued conduct directly undermines Emily’s educational well-being and best interests.  

16. The circumstances described herein constitute a material and substantial change from those existing when the judgment was entered in 2022.  

17. Modification of the existing custody arrangement is necessary to serve Emily’s best interests by ensuring her educational stability, consistent school attendance, and academic success.

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

18. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, modification of custody or visitation orders may be made upon a showing of “material and substantial change in circumstances” and where modification serves the best interests of the child.  

19. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (emphasizing that the child’s best interests govern all custody determinations).  

20. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (modification warranted where the living or parenting arrangements no longer serve the child’s welfare).  

21. See **Doe v. Doe**, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 499 (1983) (joint custody requires substantial cooperation between parties, and breakdown of communication constitutes changed circumstances).  

22. See **Rosen v. Rosen**, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016) (court has broad discretion to modify orders upon evidence of material change impacting child’s education or welfare).  

23. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (“best interests” standard is overarching and flexible to meet evolving circumstances).  

24. See **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (court will consider a child’s stability and academic performance in custody decisions).  

25. See **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (shared legal custody appropriate only where parents can cooperate in matters affecting the child’s welfare).  

26. See **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (consistent parental refusal to support child’s educational needs supports modification).  

27. See **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998), cert. denied sub nom. Hugo P. v. George P., 526 U.S. 1034 (1999) (court must emphasize the child’s welfare as paramount).  

28. See also **G.L. c. 208, § 31** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 10(b)** (defining custody determinations and best-interest factors).

### V. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

29. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the Judgment of May 15, 2022, as follows:

   a. That Plaintiff, **Jennifer Lee**, be granted **final decision-making authority regarding Emily Smith’s education and school attendance**, notwithstanding the parties’ continued shared legal custody; **or**, in the alternative,  

   b. That Defendant’s **Sunday overnight parenting time** be eliminated, with exchanges to occur on **Sunday at 6:00 p.m.**, ensuring Emily’s readiness for the school week; and  

   c. That the Court reaffirm the parties’ duty to cooperate and communicate regarding Emily’s educational and counseling needs; and  

   d. That any further relief this Honorable Court deems just and proper be granted.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee, prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the judgment of May 15, 2022;  
2. Find that modification of the current custody and parenting plan is in the **best interests of the minor child**, Emily Smith;  
3. Modify the existing order consistent with the relief requested above; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems proper and just.
