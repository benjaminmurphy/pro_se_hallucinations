### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

**I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, **Michael Roberts**, is an individual residing in or doing business in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts.

---

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 218, §19**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the Boston Municipal Court.  
4. Venue is proper in the Dorchester Division pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, §8**, because the leased premises and the underlying transactions occurred within this division.

---

**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **January 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment located at **123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts**, for a monthly rent of **$1,800**.  
6. The tenancy is an at-will or fixed-term residential tenancy governed by **G.L. c. 186** and the Massachusetts common law of landlord-tenant.  
7. During the **winter of 2024–2025**, Plaintiff’s apartment experienced recurring failures of the heating system. The indoor temperature regularly dropped to approximately **60°F for several hours** in the evenings.  
8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the defective heating conditions on multiple occasions. Defendant sent workers to make repairs twice; however, the problem recurred immediately after each attempted repair.  
9. The heating system continued to malfunction throughout the winter, rendering the premises cold, uncomfortable, and unhealthy for habitation.  
10. Plaintiff was forced to purchase and operate two electric space heaters to maintain a livable temperature, incurring approximately **$150 per month** in additional electrical costs for several months.  
11. During January 2025, Plaintiff suffered **bronchitis**, which her physician indicated was aggravated by prolonged exposure to cold indoor air. Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred medical expenses.  
12. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant failed to take effective remedial action, insisting that the heat was “working” because it never fully failed.  
13. Defendant’s failure to maintain the heating system in working order deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of her dwelling and rendered the premises unfit for human habitation under **G.L. c. 111, §127A** and related housing code regulations.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, physical discomfort, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home as a direct result of Defendant’s actions and omissions.

**IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, every residential tenancy agreement contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, ensuring that a tenant shall not be disturbed in the use and enjoyment of her rented premises by the acts or omissions of the landlord.  
17. Defendant, by failing to maintain adequate heat during the winter and by ignoring or ineffectively addressing repeated complaints, has **“directly or by interference, hindered, and disturbed”** Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her unit in violation of **G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
18. The loss of adequate heat constitutes a substantial interference with the use of leased premises, triggering liability under the statute. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); **Jablonski v. Clemons**, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004).  
19. Massachusetts courts have held that persistent defective conditions—even when partial or intermittent—constitute a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord has notice and fails to act effectively. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  
20. Defendant’s conduct is further prohibited under **105 C.M.R. 410.201** and **410.201(A)**, which require that heating facilities be maintained in good working order and capable of maintaining a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64°F otherwise.  
21. The failure of the landlord to comply with housing code standards constitutes evidence of breach of **G.L. c. 186, §14**. See **Hemingway v. O’Brien**, 363 Mass. 359 (1973); **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); **McKenna v. Begin**, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 168 (1975).  
22. Plaintiff’s situation is further supported by **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987), and **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), holding that repeated failures to correct essential problems such as lack of heat or water violate quiet enjoyment.  
23. As a result of Defendant’s violations of **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages, or not less than **three months’ rent**, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of the action.  
24. Plaintiff’s actual damages include excess utility expenses of approximately **$450**, medical costs and lost wages, and significant personal discomfort and inconvenience, totaling at least **$500**. Plaintiff seeks statutory treble damages as authorized by law.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Turner** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

A. A finding that Defendant **Michael Roberts** violated the Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;

C. Reimbursement of ancillary and consequential damages, including excess electric costs, medical expenses, and lost wages;  
D. An award of **reasonable costs and attorney’s fees** pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**;
