**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL DAVIS,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

**INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT**

Now comes the Plaintiff, *Jessica Thompson*, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **May 15, 2019**, in the above-captioned matter. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and relevant Massachusetts case law, the Plaintiff asserts that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the prior judgment such that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child, **Sophie Davis (age 8)**.

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, residing in [Plaintiff’s Address], is the primary custodial parent of the parties’ minor child, Sophie Davis.  
   Contact: (617) 555‑0123 | Email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. **Defendant:** Michael Davis, residing in [Defendant’s Address, Cape Cod, MA], is the father of Sophie Davis and exercises parenting time pursuant to the 2019 custody order.

---

### II. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER

3. A Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time was entered by this Court on **May 15, 2019**, granting primary physical custody of Sophie Davis to Jessica Thompson and awarding Michael Davis parenting time **every other weekend** and **one midweek overnight on Wednesdays**.

4. At the time of the original order, both parties resided in the same town, and the child’s commute to school from either home was minimal (approximately five minutes).

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES

5. Since the entry of the existing custody order, the Defendant has **relocated to Cape Cod**, approximately **ninety (90) miles** from the Plaintiff’s home and the child’s school.

6. Despite this substantial relocation, the Defendant continues to exercise the **Wednesday overnight**, requiring him to pick up the child from school, drive nearly two hours to Cape Cod, and awaken her around **4:30 A.M.** to return to her school the next morning.

7. This midweek travel has proven **detrimental to the child’s welfare**, routinely causing excessive fatigue, loss of concentration, and diminished performance at school. The child’s teacher has directly reported a noticeable decline in her participation on Thursdays following these overnights.

8. These circumstances represent a **material and substantial change** since the prior custody judgment, directly impacting the child’s health, emotional stability, and educational development.

9. Continuation of the midweek overnight arrangement under these new circumstances is **no longer in the child’s best interests** as contemplated by Massachusetts law.

---

### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

10. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting time order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification serves the best interests of the child.

11. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that the primary consideration in any modification proceeding is the **best interests of the child**. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Albright v. Albright**, 425 Mass. 756 (1997).

12. A parent’s significant **change in residence** that affects the practicality and stability of an existing parenting plan constitutes a material change of circumstances. *See* **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

13. The Court has wide discretion to modify parenting orders to mitigate **excessive travel or disruptions** that impair a child’s schooling or well-being. *See* **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

14. Orders that negatively impact a child’s educational welfare warrant revision under the statutory best-interest standard. *See* **Pierce v. Pierce**, 455 Mass. 286 (2009).

15. Stability and predictability in a child’s schedule are central considerations in custody determinations. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

16. The burden rests on the moving party to demonstrate the material change and corresponding benefit to the child; the Plaintiff herein meets that burden through her factual assertions and supporting evidence. *See* **Cooper v. Cooper**, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 486 (2021); **White v. LaFlamme**, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 764 (2019).

17. Because the Defendant’s relocation and the resulting harm to the child’s rest and schooling were unforeseeable at the time of the 2019 order, and because the child’s best interests are demonstrably compromised by the midweek overnight, modification is **just, proper, and necessary**.

---

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the judgment of May 15, 2019;  
B. Modify the existing order by **eliminating the Wednesday overnight** from the Defendant’s parenting schedule;  
C. Adjust the weekend schedule, as needed, to ensure meaningful parent‑child contact while protecting the child’s well‑being and school performance;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the child.

I, Jessica Thompson, affirm under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
