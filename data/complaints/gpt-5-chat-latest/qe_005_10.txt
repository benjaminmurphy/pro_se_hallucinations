# **COMPLAINT**

Plaintiff Rachel Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Mark Henderson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson is an individual residing at 45 Willow Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Mark Henderson is an individual residing and doing business as a landlord in Somerville, Massachusetts, and is the owner and lessor of the premises located at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, MA.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This action arises under the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing residential tenancies.  
4. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court under G.L. c. 223, §2 because the rental property and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred within this judicial district.  
5. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §3, and G.L. c. 218, §19.

---

## **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the second-floor apartment at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,200.  
7. The lease expressly grants Plaintiff the right to “quiet enjoyment” of the premises.  
8. Within approximately six months before the filing of this complaint, the tenants residing in the unit above Plaintiff began engaging in persistent and excessive noise, including stomping, moving furniture at late hours, and playing loud music.  
9. The noise occurs at all hours of the day and night and has continued persistently despite repeated requests from Plaintiff for it to cease.  
10. Plaintiff personally spoke with the upstairs tenants, who briefly reduced the disturbance but resumed their disruptive behavior within a week.  
11. Plaintiff complained to Defendant on at least five or six occasions, and Defendant failed to take adequate action to abate the noise.  
12. On one occasion, Defendant told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”  
13. Despite Defendant’s knowledge of the ongoing disturbances, Defendant has not taken reasonable steps to enforce the quiet enjoyment of Plaintiff’s tenancy.  
14. As a direct result of the excessive noise, Plaintiff has been deprived of sleep, averaging four to five hours per night, and has suffered health and employment consequences.  
15. Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep due to exhaustion caused by the ongoing disturbances.  
16. Plaintiff’s physician prescribed sleep medication costing approximately $40 per month.  
17. Plaintiff purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranged her bedroom in attempts to mitigate the noise without success.  
18. The disturbances have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment.  
19. Plaintiff estimates her damages at approximately $2,400, representing loss of use and enjoyment, out-of-pocket expenses, and emotional distress.  
20. Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent required under the lease and under Massachusetts law.

## **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
### **Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully set forth herein.  
22. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, §14**.  
23. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with her quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
24. Defendant breached this covenant by failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or stop excessive noise caused by other tenants under his control, despite repeated notice.  
25. The interference was substantial and material, depriving Plaintiff of the beneficial use of her apartment.  
26. The statute provides that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment” of any residential premises is liable for damages. *Id.*  
27. Defendant’s breach constitutes an indirect interference through a willful and negligent failure to act.  
28. The deprivation of quiet enjoyment is well-established under Massachusetts case law:  
   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for failing to curb nightclub noise adversely affecting tenants' quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Al Zabin v. Picucci*, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 198 (1983) (landlord’s failure to act against tenants causing disturbances constituted interference).  
   - *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (constructive interference with quiet enjoyment found where disturbances persisted after notice).  
   - *Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Tr. v. Cambridge Point, LLC*, 478 Mass. 697 (2018) (quiet enjoyment includes protection from unreasonable disturbances).  
   - *Dorgan v. Loukas*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1985) (tenant entitled to relief where landlord failed to address conditions interfering with sleep).  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (quiet enjoyment breach includes substantial interference causing mental distress).  
   - *Yee v. New England College of Optometry*, 438 Mass. 102 (2002) (covenant breached by acts or omissions materially impairing use).  
   - *Snyder v. Collura*, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 1124 (2012) (summary decision confirming landlord liability for failure to ameliorate known noise).  
   - *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing tenant’s right to habitable, undisturbed premises).  
   - *Winthrop Corp. v. Lowenthal*, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 180 (1990) (landlord responsible for ensuring peaceful possession under lease).  
29. Defendant’s conduct, through omission and neglect, therefore constitutes a violation of *G.L. c. 186, §14* and an actionable breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
30. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered loss of sleep, lost work productivity, medical expenses, and emotional distress.  
31. Pursuant to *G.L. c. 186, §14*, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, and, where appropriate, attorney’s fees.

---

## **V. DAMAGES**

32. Plaintiff estimates her total damages at $2,400, representing lost use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and related expenses.  
33. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement this amount based on evidence presented at trial.  
34. Plaintiff also seeks reasonable attorney’s fees and costs under *G.L. c. 186, §14*, although she currently proceeds pro se.

---

## **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Rachel Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that Defendant Mark Henderson breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under *G.L. c. 186, §14*;  
B. Award Plaintiff actual and consequential damages in the amount of $2,400, or such greater amount as may be proven at trial;  
C. Award statutory damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to *G.L. c. 186, §14*; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
