**JESSICA TURNER,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.

---

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the equitable powers of this Court, respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order entered on May 15, 2018, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, and states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Turner, of [Plaintiff’s address], is the mother of the minor child, **Ethan Johnson**, born [DOB omitted], currently age eight (8).  
   Phone: (617) 555‑0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** Mark Johnson, of [Defendant’s address], is the father of **Ethan Johnson**, a minor child subject to the existing custody order of this Court.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, and **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, as the original judgment concerning custody and visitation was issued by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, and the minor child resides within its jurisdiction.  

4. Venue is proper in this Division because both parties reside in Middlesex County and the original decree was entered here.

---

## **III. PRIOR ORDER**

5. On or about **May 15, 2018**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** granting the Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the parties’ minor child, with the Defendant receiving limited parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit.  

6. The 2018 order expressly prohibited **overnight visitation** due to the Defendant’s then‑limited housing circumstances (a rented room in a shared apartment without a private room for the child).

---

## **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since the entry of the 2018 judgment, there has occurred a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the child’s welfare, satisfying the standard set forth in *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

8. The Defendant now has **stable housing**, residing in his own apartment where **Ethan has his own bedroom** and a safe, appropriate environment for overnight visitation.  

9. The minor child is now **eight years old**, attending school full‑time, and his developmental, educational, and social needs have changed considerably since age three.  

10. The current schedule, designed for a preschool child, requires multiple short visits during the school week, which causes significant **disruption to routine, homework, and sleep patterns**, contrary to Ethan’s best interests.  

11. Both parents acknowledge that the present arrangement no longer serves Ethan’s stability or emotional well‑being, and agree a more age‑appropriate schedule with extended and overnight visits is warranted.  

12. Pursuant to *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), when a material change in circumstances affects the child’s best interests, the Court must revisit and modify the prior custody judgment accordingly.  

13. Continued enforcement of an outdated and restrictive parenting plan constitutes a material detriment to the child under *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

14. Ethan’s increasing maturity, expressed desire for extended time and overnights with his father, and the father’s improved living situation demonstrate that modification of the parenting schedule serves the child’s best interests, as contemplated by *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), and *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).  

15. Both parents have shown an ability to communicate effectively regarding Ethan’s schooling and welfare, and, under *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), the Court favors parenting arrangements that foster cooperative decision‑making and sustained parental relationships.  

16. A revised schedule allowing overnight parenting time would reduce weekday exchanges, support the child’s educational routine, and align with the policy of maintaining meaningful relationships with both parents under *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) and *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).  

17. The requested modification does not alter legal custody (decision‑making authority) and remains consistent with the child’s best interests standard under **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, and *Vilaythong v. Crowell*, 470 Mass. 1007 (2014).

---

## **V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

18. Plaintiff requests that the existing Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time dated **May 15, 2018** be **modified** to reflect the following relief:

   a. That **Mark Johnson** be granted parenting time with **Ethan Johnson** on a **biweekly weekend schedule with overnights** (e.g., from Friday after school until Sunday at 5:00 p.m.), and such additional weekday time as the Court deems appropriate;  
   b. That the weekday short visits be reduced or adjusted to minimize school‑night travel and disruption;  
   c. That the new schedule take effect promptly upon entry of an order; and  
   d. That the Court grant such further relief as justice and the child’s best interests require.

---

## **VI. LEGAL BASIS**

19. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a custody order may be modified “upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”  

20. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently affirmed that the touchstone of any custody modification is the **child’s best interests**.  See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); *Vilaythong v. Crowell*, 470 Mass. 1007 (2014).  

21. Here, the combination of the child’s increased age and schooling, the father’s improved living conditions, and both parents’ recognition that the current schedule causes avoidable stress satisfies the statutory and common‑law criteria for modification.

---

## **VII. CONCLUSION**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Turner**, respectfully **requests that the Court:**

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the May 15, 2018 judgment;  
2. Determine that a modified parenting schedule with regular overnight visits serves **Ethan Johnson’s best interests**;  
3. Enter a new **Order of Custody and Parenting Time** consistent with the relief described herein; and  
4. Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper.
