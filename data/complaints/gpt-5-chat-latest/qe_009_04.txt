### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

#### I. PARTIES
1. Plaintiff, **Jessica Greene**, resides at 456 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.  
2. Defendant, **Mark Thompson**, is an individual doing business as a landlord of the above address and, upon information and belief, resides or conducts business in Springfield, Massachusetts.

---

#### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. This action is brought pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, for breach of the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, §8**, because the premises at issue are located in Springfield, Massachusetts.  
5. The amount in controversy does not exceed $7,000, placing this case within the jurisdiction of the Springfield District Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19**.

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6. Plaintiff has rented a two-bedroom apartment located at 456 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, from Defendant since January 15, 2022, at a monthly rent of $1,200.  
7. Since approximately **October 15, 2025**, the electrical outlets and overhead lighting in one bedroom of the apartment have been inoperative.  
8. The remainder of the apartment retains electricity, but the affected room has had no functioning power for approximately six weeks.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant initially sent an electrician, who informed Plaintiff that major rewiring work would be required to restore service.  
10. Defendant has failed to complete the necessary repairs, stating merely that the repair is “complicated” and that he is “getting quotes.”  
11. Because of the inoperative electrical system, Plaintiff cannot use the second bedroom—which had served as her home office—for its intended and agreed purpose.  
12. Plaintiff has been forced to work from coffee shops and a coworking space, incurring out-of-pocket costs of approximately $15 per day for food and coffee, and $150 per month for a coworking membership.  
13. Plaintiff’s living conditions have been substantially impaired due to overcrowding of her office equipment in common areas, resulting in diminished habitability and quiet enjoyment.  
14. Defendant’s delay and failure to restore electrical service constitute unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I — Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises.”  
17. Defendant’s failure to remedy the unsafe and unusable electrical condition, despite notice and the passage of more than six weeks, constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s lawful use and enjoyment of the premises within the meaning of §14.  
18. The covenant protects tenants against both affirmative acts and omissions that materially deprive lawful possession and beneficial use. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  
19. Constructive interference includes the landlord’s failure to maintain essential utilities, as recognized in *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), and *Meikle v. Nurse*, 474 Mass. 207 (2016).  
20. Electric service is an essential service whose interruption renders premises partially uninhabitable under *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) and *Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.*, 437 Mass. 708 (2002).  
21. Defendant’s inaction in repairing the wiring constitutes a “serious interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment” as defined by *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).  
22. A landlord’s failure to respond diligently to electrical defects after notice is “interference” within the meaning of §14. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
23. Pursuant to §14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, in addition to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, though Plaintiff proceeds *pro se*.  
24. The Defendant’s conduct also constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized at common law. See *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  
25. The interference was neither temporary nor trivial—it persisted for over six weeks, preventing ordinary and necessary use of one room and forcing Plaintiff to incur alternative workspace expenses.  
26. Plaintiff’s losses include diminished value of the rented premises, out-of-pocket expenditures of approximately $720, and deprivation of quiet enjoyment and habitability.  
27. Defendant’s acts and omissions directly caused Plaintiff’s damages.

C. Award Plaintiff costs of suit and any statutory attorney’s fees recoverable, even if self-represented;  
D. Declare that Defendant’s failure to repair the electrical wiring constitutes an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and beneficial use of the leased premises; and
