Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**INTRODUCTION**

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, **Jennifer Collins**, pursuant to *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28*, *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20*, and the inherent equitable powers of this Honorable Court, and respectfully requests a **modification of the existing custody order** entered on **September 15, 2021**, in the **Worcester Probate and Family Court**, on the grounds that **a material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the prior judgment, such that modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the minor child, Ethan Collins (age 8)**.

---

## **PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** *Jennifer Collins*, residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  
   Phone: (617) 555‑0123 Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** *Mark Collins*, residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  

3. **Child of the parties:** Ethan Collins, born [month/day/year], age 8.

---

## **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the minor child pursuant to *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28* and *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20*.

5. Venue is proper in the Worcester Division of the Probate and Family Court because the original custody order was entered here and the child and both parents reside within its jurisdictional boundaries.

6. The current custody order was entered on **September 15, 2021**, and granted the parties **shared legal custody**, with Ethan residing primarily with the Plaintiff and visiting the Defendant on designated weekends.

---

## **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. At the time of the prior judgment, the Court found both parents stable and capable of cooperative co‑parenting.

8. Since that order, substantial and material changes have occurred affecting the welfare of the minor child.

9. The Plaintiff has been informed by Ethan that the Defendant consumes “special drinks” while the child is present and that at times the Defendant “cannot walk straight.”

10. On or about recent months, a trusted neighbor provided the Plaintiff with a video depicting the Defendant visibly impaired while removing the child from a vehicle late at night.

11. Ethan’s school has reported that he appears exhausted and unfocused on Monday mornings following weekend visits with the Defendant, suggesting that his sleep schedule or supervision may be inadequate during those visits.

12. These circumstances raise grave concerns regarding the Defendant’s sobriety, capacity to provide safe supervision, and the potential adverse impact on the child’s emotional and physical well‑being.

13. The Plaintiff believes that the Defendant’s substance use represents a material change in circumstance and poses a serious risk to the child’s best interests.

14. The Plaintiff continues to provide a stable, supportive home environment for Ethan, maintaining consistent school attendance, extracurricular involvement, and medical care.

15. The Plaintiff has attempted to communicate and co‑parent cooperatively, but the Defendant’s recent behavior has rendered such cooperation increasingly difficult and unsafe.

---

## **LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

16. Under *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28*, the Court may modify a custody order upon a showing of **a material and substantial change in circumstances** and where modification would serve the **best interests of the child**.  

17. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the “paramount consideration” in custody modification cases is the welfare and best interests of the child. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).

18. A material change in circumstances is one that affects the child’s welfare such that modification is necessary. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19. Allegations of parental substance abuse constitute a significant change warranting modification where such conduct endangers the minor child. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Adoption of Frederick*, 405 Mass. 1 (1989).

20. The Court must weigh evidence of instability or neglect in determining whether existing custodial arrangements continue to serve the child’s best interests. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

21. The Court retains broad equitable power under *G.L. c. 215, § 6* and *Coppinger v. Coppinger*, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 709 (2003),* to fashion custodial conditions, including supervised visitation, to ensure the child’s safety.*

22. Pursuant to *Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 31*, shared custody requires parents to demonstrate the ability to communicate and cooperate; if such cooperation materially deteriorates, modification is appropriate. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, supra.

23. *Kendall v. Kendall*, 426 Mass. 238 (1997),* emphasizes the Court’s responsibility to intervene when the custodial environment poses risk to a child’s physical or moral development.*

24. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003),* directs that existing orders must yield to new arrangements when material circumstances make continued enforcement contrary to a child’s best interests.*

25. *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007),* and *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998),* reiterate that a child’s safety and stability outweigh any parental preference.*

26. On these authorities, the Defendant’s apparent increased alcohol or substance use, and the resulting safety concerns, constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** under Massachusetts law.

## **REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the **Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins**, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the September 15, 2021 custody order, affecting the best interests of Ethan Collins;

B. Modify the existing custody order to provide that:

   1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, shall retain **sole legal and physical custody** of Ethan Collins; and/or  
   2. The Defendant’s parenting time shall be **supervised** by an appropriate third party or supervised visitation center approved by the Court; or  
   3. Alternatively, place appropriate **conditions on the Defendant’s visitation**, including abstinence from alcohol, submission to random testing, and attendance at substance abuse counseling, as the Court deems in the child’s best interests.

C. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.
