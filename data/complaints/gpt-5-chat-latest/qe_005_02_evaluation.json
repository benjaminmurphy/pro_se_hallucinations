The court\u2019s quiet enjoyment analysis focuses on unsanitary physical conditions and flooding attributable to the landlord\u2019s failure to keep the apartment watertight, not on intolerable conduct by neighboring tenants.

The Court holds that if the housing authority\u2019s omissions in addressing criminal activity in common areas substantially impair tenants\u2019 ability to use the property, that can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment, and it remands for trial on that claim.
