**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**BRISTOL DIVISION**  

Docket No. _________  

**Emily Carter,**  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**James Carter,**  
Defendant  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  
(M.G.L. c. 208 § 28; c. 209C § 20; and related authority)  

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Carter**, respectfully submits this *Complaint for Modification* seeking a change in the existing custody arrangement between herself and the Defendant, **James Carter**, concerning their minor child, **Sophie Carter (age 12)**.

2. This request is brought pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208 § 28**, **c. 209C § 20**, and the controlling caselaw interpreting those provisions, on the ground that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the existing judgment of custody.

3. The Plaintiff seeks an order granting her **primary physical custody** of the minor child, with appropriate parenting time for the Defendant consistent with his current health and ability to safely exercise custodial care.

---

### II. BACKGROUND

4. The parties were previously before this Honorable Court in *Bristol Probate and Family Court*, which entered a judgment of custody and parenting time dated **May 10, 2018**, establishing a **50/50 shared physical custody** arrangement.

5. The current order provides that the parents alternate physical custody of their daughter on a weekly basis, with exchanges occurring on Sundays.

6. At the time of the original order, both parents resided near one another, were in good health, and cooperated effectively concerning their daughter’s needs and schooling.

7. For several years, the arrangement functioned well and fostered stability in Sophie’s schooling, social life, and routines.

### III. SUBSTANTIAL AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the prior judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that significantly affects the welfare and best interests of the child within the meaning of *M.G.L. c. 208 § 28*, *M.G.L. c. 209C § 20*, and the cases interpreting those statutes.

9. Specifically, in the past year, the Defendant, **James Carter**, has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that impairs his mobility, balance, and physical coordination.

10. The Defendant has experienced multiple **falls at home** and now relies on a **wheelchair** for ambulation.

11. The Defendant’s treating physician has advised that he should **not be alone with the minor child in situations requiring physical responsiveness**, such as managing stairs, vehicle transfers, or emergency situations.

12. Despite this, the Defendant continues to insist on exercising the full 50/50 custody schedule, and during his custodial weeks has relied on their twelve-year-old daughter to assist with physical tasks such as helping him transfer between his wheelchair and bed or retrieving objects he cannot reach.

13. This situation places an unfair emotional and physical burden on Sophie and creates safety and welfare concerns inconsistent with her best interests.

14. The Plaintiff resides in the same community, remains healthy, and is able to provide consistent care, stability, and support.

15. The child continues to thrive in school and community activities when in the Plaintiff’s care.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARDS

16. Under **M.G.L. c. 208 § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody judgment if “a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment is no longer in the best interests of the child.”

17. Similarly, pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 209C § 20**, custody and parenting orders concerning children of unmarried parents may be modified “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the child may require.”

18. Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly held that a change in a parent’s health or capacity to care for a child may constitute a material change in circumstances. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19. The court’s paramount consideration is always the **best interests of the child**. *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976).

20. Other cases confirming this principle include:  
   - *Care and Protection of Jeremy*, 419 Mass. 616 (1995);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016);  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012);  
   - *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

21. These authorities collectively confirm that material changes—such as a parent’s deterioration in physical or mental health—can justify reopening and adjusting custodial arrangements to protect a child’s welfare.

22. The standard is not punitive but protective, ensuring the order reflects the child’s best interests in light of current realities. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–185.

### V. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

23. The Defendant’s newly developed and progressive neurological condition represents a **significant change** from the circumstances that existed when the original shared custody order was entered.

24. The Defendant’s physical limitations now preclude him from safely performing the daily custodial responsibilities necessary to ensure the minor child’s safety.

25. The child’s welfare and best interests require that custody be modified so that the Plaintiff serves as the **primary physical custodian**, while the Defendant continues to have meaningful and regular parenting time consistent with his health and capability.

26. This modification will preserve the child’s relationship with both parents while ensuring her safety and emotional well-being.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Wherefore, the Plaintiff, **Emily Carter**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the Judgment of May 10, 2018;

B. Determine that it is in the **best interests of the minor child, Sophie Carter**, that the Plaintiff be awarded **primary physical custody**;

C. Establish a **modified parenting time schedule** for the Defendant, **James Carter**, consistent with his medical condition and ability to safely care for the child;

D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
