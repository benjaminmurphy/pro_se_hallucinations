Docket No. _________  

**JESSICA TAYLOR,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Taylor, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the mother and current primary physical custodian of the minor child, **Daniel Johnson**, age eight (8). She may be contacted at (617) 555‑0123 or by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

2. **Defendant:** Mark Johnson, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the father of said minor child.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** under *Massachusetts General Laws* (“M.G.L.”) c. 208, § 28, and c. 215, § 6.  

---

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND BACKGROUND

4. On or about **September 15, 2018**, this Court entered a custody and parenting order granting Plaintiff, **Jessica Taylor**, primary physical custody of Daniel Johnson.  

5. Under the existing order, Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, was awarded parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with **no overnights**.  

6. The prior order was based upon circumstances existing in 2018, including the father’s then‑limited living situation—a single bedroom in a shared apartment without appropriate space for a child to stay overnight.  

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the entry of the 2018 judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties and of the minor child, warranting modification of the custody and parenting plan pursuant to *M.G.L.* c. 208, § 28.  

8. The minor child, **Daniel**, is now eight years old, in elementary school full‑time, and has developed a close, stable relationship with both parents.  

9. Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, has since acquired a **two‑bedroom apartment** where Daniel has his own bedroom and enjoys a safe, age‑appropriate environment suitable for overnight parenting time.  

10. Daniel regularly expresses a desire to spend longer, more consistent blocks of time with his father, including **overnight visits**, and both parents agree that such a schedule would better support his **emotional well‑being and educational stability**.  

11. The existing schedule, which involves multiple short visits on school nights with frequent transitions back and forth, has become **developmentally inappropriate**, disruptive to Daniel’s sleep and homework schedule, and inconsistent with his best interests.  

12. The requested change will reduce transitions, allow Daniel to maintain better routines for school, and promote his continuing positive relationship with both parents.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD

13. Pursuant to *M.G.L.* c. 208, § 28, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that modification is **in the best interests of the child**.  

14. The Supreme Judicial Court and the Appeals Court have consistently held that the guiding principle in any modification of custody or parenting time is the **best interests of the child**. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).  

15. Massachusetts courts recognize that substantial physical and developmental changes, including a parent’s improved living conditions and the child’s maturation, justify revisiting previously issued custody orders. *See* *Rogers v. Rogers*, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 337 (1984); *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); *Zullo v. Goguen*, 423 Mass. 679 (1996).  

16. The Court has authority under *M.G.L.* c. 215, § 6 and the inherent equitable powers of the Probate and Family Court to **modify** existing orders to preserve the welfare of minor children. *See* *Custody of Gabriel*, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 121 (2012); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  

17. In evaluating a change in circumstances, the Court should consider, inter alia, each parent’s current home environment and the developmental needs of the child. *See* *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Ireland v. Ireland*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 495 (1997).  

18. Here, the stability, maturity, and safety improvements in both the father’s housing situation and the child’s developmental needs reflect a **substantial and material change** warranting modification.

### V. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Taylor**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. **Modify** the existing custody and parenting‑time order entered September 15, 2018, to reflect the material change in circumstances;  

B. **Adopt a new parenting schedule** granting Defendant **Mark Johnson** reasonable and regular overnight parenting time, consistent with the child’s age and school schedule—such as alternating weekends from Friday after school through Sunday evening and one mid‑week dinner;  

C. **Retain primary physical custody** with the Plaintiff pending agreement or further order of the Court, recognizing both parents’ joint legal custody and cooperative communication regarding Daniel’s education, health, and welfare;  

D. Find that modification is in the **best interests of the child** under the standards articulated in *M.G.L.* c. 208, § 28 and the authorities cited above; and  

E. Grant such **other and further relief** as the Court deems just and proper.
