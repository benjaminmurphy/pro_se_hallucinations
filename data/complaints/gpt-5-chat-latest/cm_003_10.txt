**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL ROGERS,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
**Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209 § 37; and applicable Massachusetts case law**

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson,** and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify its existing custody judgment entered on September 15, 2021, in the above-captioned matter concerning the minor child, **Ethan Rogers (age 9)**. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the mother of Ethan Rogers, minor child of the parties.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Rogers, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, is the father of the minor child.  
3. Both parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to the original Judgment of Custody and Parenting entered on September 15, 2021.

---

### II. PRIOR COURT ORDER

4. On **September 15, 2021**, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered a **Judgment of Shared Legal Custody** providing that the parties share legal custody of Ethan Rogers, with Ethan’s primary residence being with Plaintiff Jessica Thompson and weekend parenting time with Defendant Michael Rogers.  
5. At the time of the original judgment, the Court determined that both parents were stable, capable of co-parenting, and that shared custody was in the best interests of the child.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. Since the date of the 2021 Judgment, **material and substantial changes in circumstances** have arisen affecting Ethan’s welfare and best interests.  
7. Plaintiff has observed and received information indicating that Defendant has developed a problem with **alcohol use** that interferes with his ability to safely care for Ethan.  
8. The minor child has reported to Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s residence and that Defendant is sometimes “unable to walk straight.”  
9. A neighbor provided Plaintiff with a **video recording** depicting Defendant visibly stumbling while taking Ethan out of a car late at night.  
10. Ethan’s school has reported to Plaintiff that Ethan appears **exhausted every Monday morning** following weekends spent with Defendant, raising concerns regarding appropriate supervision, rest, and care during Defendant’s parenting time.  
11. These facts collectively constitute a serious and ongoing **substantial change in circumstances** since the prior custody judgment.  
12. The change has a direct and negative impact on Ethan’s safety, emotional stability, and well-being, necessitating modification of the visitation provisions.  

---

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

13. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and when modification serves the **best interests of the child**.  
14. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the child's best interests are the paramount consideration in all custody matters. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
15. Where evidence suggests instability, substance misuse, or any behavior posing risk to a child’s safety, the Court has the authority and obligation to adjust custody or visitation arrangements. *See* **Adoption of Vito**, 431 Mass. 550 (2000); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
16. The Court must evaluate current parental capabilities in light of the child’s welfare. *See* **R.H. v. B.F.**, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (1995); **Custody of a Minor**, 383 Mass. 595 (1981).  
17. A change based on substance abuse and household instability has repeatedly been found sufficient to warrant modification of custody or parenting conditions. *See* **Williams v. Massa**, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); **Costa v. Costa**, 422 Mass. 551 (1996); **Guardianship of Estelle**, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007).  
18. In determining what arrangement best serves Ethan’s welfare, the Court should ensure that any parenting time by Defendant occurs under conditions ensuring Ethan’s safety and emotional security.

---

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

19. Plaintiff does **not** seek to terminate Defendant’s relationship with Ethan but respectfully requests that the Court modify the current custody judgment as follows:

   a. That Plaintiff **retain sole physical custody** and continue to exercise shared or primary legal custody as appropriate, pending further order;  
   b. That **Defendant’s parenting time be modified** so that all overnights occur only under **supervised conditions** approved by the Court or the Probate and Family Court Probation Department;  
   c. That Defendant engage in a **substance abuse evaluation** and follow any treatment recommendations prior to any reinstatement of unsupervised parenting time;  
   d. That the Court issue any further conditions necessary to ensure Ethan’s **safety and well-being** during parenting time; and  
   e. That the Court grant such **other and further relief** as it deems just and proper.

---

### VI. SUPPORTING AUTHORITY

20. This request is supported by the authority granted under **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31**, **G.L. c. 209 § 37**, and **G.L. c. 208 § 34**, providing for modification of custody judgments based upon material change in circumstances.  
21. Relevant precedents include:  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) – The best interests of the child govern custody modifications.  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) – Custody orders are modifiable upon a substantial change in circumstances.  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) – Parental impairment may justify modification.  
   - *Adoption of Vito*, 431 Mass. 550 (2000) – Child’s safety and stability are paramount.  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) – Changes in parental fitness warrant modification.  
   - *R.H. v. B.F.*, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (1995) – The court considers post-judgment conduct affecting children.  
   - *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. 595 (1981) – Protection of children’s welfare as overriding concern.  
   - *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000) – Substantial changes must relate to child’s welfare.  
   - *Costa v. Costa*, 422 Mass. 551 (1996) – Evidence of substance abuse supports modification.  
   - *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007) – Inability to care adequately due to impairment supports change in custody.
