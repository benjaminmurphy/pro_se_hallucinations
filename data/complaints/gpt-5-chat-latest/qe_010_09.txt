### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant beginning on **June 1, 2020**, for the residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts. Plaintiff has paid $1,200 in monthly rent consistently and in full.

6. Beginning in or around **September 2025**, Plaintiff observed mold growth in the bathroom of her apartment, initially confined to a small corner of the shower area but eventually spreading across the ceiling and adjacent walls.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant inspected the bathroom but refused to take appropriate remedial measures, instead blaming Plaintiff for “taking showers that are too hot and too long” and “not running the fan enough.”

8. The bathroom has no window and thus limited ventilation. Plaintiff regularly uses the existing exhaust fan while bathing.

9. As a result of the mold growth and Defendant’s refusal to adequately remedy the condition or improve ventilation, Plaintiff experienced respiratory difficulties including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, as diagnosed by her physician as likely related to mold exposure.

10. Plaintiff’s property—specifically her shower curtain and towels with a replacement value of approximately $60—were destroyed due to mold contamination.

11. Plaintiff has incurred physical discomfort and distress, interference with her use and enjoyment of her home, and diminution of the value of her tenancy.

12. Despite repeated notice, Defendant has failed and refused to repair the defective condition or fully remediate the mold to render the apartment habitable and safe.

### COUNT I  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
*(G.L. c. 186, §14)*

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts contains an implied **covenant of quiet enjoyment** guaranteeing the tenant the right to occupy leased premises free from material interference by the landlord.

15. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a safe and habitable condition, including permitting persistent mold growth and refusing to repair the ventilation defects, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
    - *See*, e.g., **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable when acts or omissions substantially interfere with tenant’s quiet enjoyment);  
    - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s delay in abating severe odor and flooding constituted breach);  
    - **McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 429 Mass. 300 (1999) (affirming that covenant protects against conditions materially impairing habitability);  
    - **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (landlord’s failure to ensure safe and sanitary premises supports recovery under §14);  
    - **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (failure to repair chronic water infiltration violated covenant of quiet enjoyment);  
    - **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (landlord’s neglect of structural and sanitary conditions can establish breach);  
    - **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability intertwined with quiet enjoyment);  
    - **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (breach established where landlord failed to address nuisance and unsanitary conditions);  
    - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (tenant’s health problems due to landlord’s neglect sufficient to prove substantial interference); and  
    - **G.L. c. 239, §8A** (allowing tenant defenses and counterclaims based on breach of quiet enjoyment and conditions affecting habitability).

16. Defendant’s actions and omissions—specifically failing to remediate mold and blaming Plaintiff instead of acting—constitute the type of “direct or indirect” disturbance covered by §14.

17. Defendant’s conduct was willful or at least negligent and resulted in harm to Plaintiff’s health, comfort, property, and use of her home.

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:
   - physical symptoms related to mold exposure;
   - loss of personal property ($60 in value);
   - diminished enjoyment and use of the premises; and
   - emotional distress and discomfort.

19. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, even if she is self-represented.

C. Award Plaintiff reimbursement for her lost property ($60) and any other proven actual damages;  
D. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and any other relief the Court deems fair and equitable; and
