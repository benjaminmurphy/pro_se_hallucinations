#### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7.  On or about **February 1, 2023**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant for a studio apartment located at **567 Jamaica Plain Ave., Jamaica Plain, MA**.

8.  The monthly rent under the agreement is **$1,300**.

9.  During the initial showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling and specifically inquired about them. Defendant represented that the stains were from an **“old leak”** that had been **“totally fixed.”**

10.  Relying on Defendant’s representations, Plaintiff entered into the tenancy.

11.  In or around the Spring of 2023, following the first major rainstorm during her tenancy, water began dripping from the same area of the ceiling where the water stains appeared.

12.  Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak. Despite multiple subsequent complaints, Defendant failed and refused to correct the condition.

13.  Defendant repeatedly dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns, describing the condition as a **“minor cosmetic issue”** and asserting that the apartment had **“character.”**

14.  The leak worsened with time and during one storm caused substantial damage, soaking Plaintiff’s couch and destroying a laptop that Plaintiff had purchased and valued at approximately **$900**.

15.  The continuous presence of moisture has created a **musty odor** and visible signs of mold growth. Plaintiff has experienced **headaches and discomfort**, which she reasonably believes are connected to the unhealthy indoor conditions.

16.  Plaintiff has been forced to **rearrange and limit her use of the apartment**, effectively losing the use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the rented premises.

17.  At all times relevant, Defendant has refused to undertake adequate repairs, in violation of his statutory and common‑law duties.

18.  Plaintiff remains current on her rent payments, paying full rent despite being deprived of full use and enjoyment of the rental unit.

#### COUNT I  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

19.  Plaintiff restates and realleges paragraphs 1–18 as though fully set forth herein.

20.  Under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every residential lease contains an implied covenant that the tenant shall have the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. A landlord may not, directly or indirectly, interfere with the tenant’s use or possession of the premises.

21.  Defendant’s failure to repair the recurrent leak, despite notice and repeated complaints, constitutes a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

22.  Defendant’s conduct and omissions have rendered portions of the Premises unhealthy, unsafe, and uninhabitable.

23.  Plaintiff’s conditions of tenancy are within the ambit of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized by **Massachusetts case law**, including but not limited to:

   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714** (1977) (landlord liable for substantial interference with tenant’s enjoyment even without intentional conduct).  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91** (1982) (persistent flooding and failure to repair constitute breach of quiet enjoyment and warrant emotional distress damages).  
   - *Lowery v. Robinson*, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982** (1982) (water infiltration and failure to repair breach covenant of quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273** (1994) (quiet enjoyment protects tenants from conditions affecting health and safety).  
   - *Brown v. LeClair*, **20 Mass. App. Ct. 976** (1985) (ongoing landlord neglect and unremedied defects violate covenant).  
   - *Lipsitt v. Plaud*, **466 Mass. 240** (2013) (statutory remedy under § 14 is available for negligent or reckless failure to act).  
   - *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, **410 Mass. 855** (1991) (landlord’s inaction after notice constitutes constructive eviction and breach).  
   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847** (1997) (tenants entitled to damages and attorney’s fees for violation of § 14).  
   - *Young v. Patukonis*, **24 Mass. App. Ct. 907** (1987) (failure to maintain premises in habitable condition breaches quiet enjoyment).  
   - *Coveney v. President & Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross*, **388 Mass. 16** (1983) (outlining availability of emotional distress damages when landlord’s conduct is reckless).

24.  Defendant’s persistent neglect and misrepresentation regarding the water leak and resultant mold constitute an **unreasonable interference** with Plaintiff’s tenancy and a **violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

25.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has sustained **property damage**, **loss of use**, **emotional distress**, and other consequential harm, including the **$900** loss of her laptop and loss of functional living space for many months.

26.  Plaintiff is entitled to **actual damages**, **statutory damages of not less than one month’s rent or three times actual damages (whichever is greater)**, **costs**, **reasonable attorney’s fees**, and **other relief** as authorized by **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**.
