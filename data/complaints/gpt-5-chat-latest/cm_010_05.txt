**JESSICA HARRINGTON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL HARRINGTON,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Jessica Harrington**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the current Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered on **April 15, 2018**, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, concerning the minor child **Sophie Harrington (age 10)**, born to the parties. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Harrington, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Harrington. She may be contacted at telephone (617) 555‑0123 and email psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Harrington, the father of the minor child, resides within Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, as the existing order was entered by this Court and both parties and the child remain within Massachusetts.

---

### II. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ORDER

4. On or about **April 15, 2018**, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order granting **primary physical custody** of the parties’ minor child, Sophie Harrington, to the Defendant, with the Plaintiff to have **limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner per week**.

5. The 2018 order was based upon the circumstances at that time: Plaintiff was then a graduate student residing in a small studio apartment and working an inflexible academic schedule. Those facts constrained her ability to provide a stable home suitable for regular overnights.

6. At the time, the Court reasonably found the existing arrangement to serve Sophie’s best interests.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the 2018 order, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** warranting reconsideration of custody and parenting time. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Prenaveau v. Prenaveau**, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 131 (2009).

8. Plaintiff has **completed her graduate education**, obtained **stable employment** with normal day‑time hours, and now resides in a **two‑bedroom apartment**, where Sophie has her own bedroom.

9. The minor child’s age, developmental stage, and preferences have changed significantly since entry of the prior order. Sophie is now ten years old, capable of expressing her own views, which the Court may consider under **G.L. c. 208, § 31** and **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

10. Sophie’s **therapist has reported** that the child experiences guilt and distress over leaving her mother’s home after short visits, and that extended time with Plaintiff would alleviate that distress and strengthen her emotional well‑being.

11. Sophie has **expressed to both parents and to this Court (by letter)** her desire to spend more overnights with her mother. See **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (child’s preferences, while not controlling, are relevant to best‑interest analysis).

12. Plaintiff and Sophie have **developed a close and healthy relationship** since 2018, demonstrating that greater parenting time with Plaintiff would be in the child’s best interest. See **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

13. The Defendant **refuses to discuss any modification** of the parenting schedule and reacts angrily when Sophie raises the issue, creating tension and emotional difficulty for the child.

14. These changes—Plaintiff’s improved circumstances, the child’s age and development, the child’s expressed preference, and emotional needs—constitute a **material and substantial change** affecting the child’s welfare. See **Stevens v. Stevens**, 337 Mass. 625 (1958); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

15. Modification is also supported by principles that prioritize a child’s best interests above prior arrangements when justified by new facts. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **White v. LaBelle**, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 719 (1996); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).

---

### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF

16. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and related caselaw, a custody or parenting order may be modified where a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred and modification serves the **best interests of the child**.

17. The child’s best interests are the paramount concern. See **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

18. Plaintiff’s improved residential stability, financial independence, and ability to provide consistent care, combined with the child’s emotional health and expressed wishes, establish that modification will promote Sophie’s emotional and developmental well‑being.

---

### V. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

19. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Modify the Judgment of April 15, 2018, to provide for **shared or increased physical custody** consistent with the child’s best interests;  

   b. Establish a **parenting schedule** granting Plaintiff extended overnights and additional weekend time, such as alternating weekends and one or two weeknight overnights per week;  

   c. Direct that the parties cooperate with Sophie’s therapist or a court‑appointed parenting coordinator if necessary to implement a smooth transition; and  

   d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the April 15, 2018 custody order;  
2. Modify said order to provide the Plaintiff with increased parenting time consistent with Sophie’s best interests;  
3. Maintain joint legal custody (if currently in effect);  
4. Order such other relief as may be just and equitable.

---

### VII. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE

I, **Jessica Harrington**, being duly sworn, state that the facts set forth in this Complaint for Modification are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

  
Respectfully submitted this **1st day of December, 2025**.
