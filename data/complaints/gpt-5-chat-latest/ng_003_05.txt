---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully present as a business invitee at Defendant’s store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  

6. Defendant operated and controlled the premises, including the shelving, displays, and merchandise positioning within the aisles.  

7. At the time, heavy boxes of kitchen appliances were stacked high on shelves within the store, approximately five to six boxes in height, without any safety restraints, railings, or barriers to prevent a fall.  

8. Defendant knew or should have known that stacking such heavy boxes without securing them created an unreasonable risk of harm to customers lawfully on the premises.  

9. While Plaintiff was examining merchandise in a kitchen aisle, another customer’s cart made light contact with a lower shelf. Immediately following this minor contact, a heavy toaster‑oven box fell from an upper shelf and struck Plaintiff on the right shoulder and head.  

10. Plaintiff experienced immediate dizziness, headache, and shoulder pain.  

11. The store manager approached Plaintiff, completed an incident report, and offered him only a store coupon rather than medical assistance or further protective action.  

12. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, and he sought treatment at a local emergency room.  

13. Medical providers diagnosed Plaintiff with a **mild concussion** and **shoulder strain**.  

14. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately **$1,200** and lost wages of approximately **$600** due to his inability to work for several days as a delivery driver.  

15. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, inconvenience, lost recreational opportunities (including missing weekly soccer games for roughly one month), and emotional distress.  

16. Defendant, through its employees and agents, owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the store premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn of known hazards, and to exercise due care in the storing and stacking of merchandise.  

17. Defendant breached this duty by:  
   a. Failing to secure boxed merchandise on high shelving;  
   b. Failing to inspect and remedy unsafe stacking practices;  
   c. Failing to warn customers of the potential falling‑object hazard; and  
   d. Failing to adopt proper merchandising and safety protocols consistent with reasonable retail practices.  

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, financial losses, and non‑economic damages.

---

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  

20. Under **Massachusetts common law**, a store owner owes business invitees a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973); *Wilbur v. Newton*, 302 Mass. 38, 39 (1938).  

21. This duty includes maintaining display shelves and merchandise in a condition that does not pose an unreasonable risk of harm to patrons. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 373–74 (2010).  

22. Defendant breached this duty by allowing heavy boxes to be stacked unsafely without restraints, by failing to inspect the shelving for hazards, and by failing to institute reasonable precautions against foreseeable harm. *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 166 (1980) (negligence found where property owner failed to remedy or warn of known hazards).  

23. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (proximate cause established where harm is foreseeable consequence of negligent act).  

24. Plaintiff’s losses, including medical expenses, lost wages, and non‑economic damages, are compensable under **Massachusetts common law of negligence** and **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which governs comparative negligence and allocation of fault.  

25. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent retailer would exercise under similar circumstances. *Stepakoff v. Kantar*, 393 Mass. 836, 841 (1985).  

26. A business owner is liable when injury results from negligently maintained or arranged merchandise on its premises. See *Payne v. Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc.*, 965 F. Supp. 2d 307, 310 (D. Mass. 2013); *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84, 88 (1988).  

27. The foreseeable danger of stacked goods falling from a shelf establishes a breach of reasonable care. *Boothby v. Texon, Inc.*, 414 Mass. 468, 481 (1993).  

28. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable and directly resulted from Defendant’s negligence. *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996).  

29. Under **G.L. c. 93A, § 2**, while not asserted as an independent count herein, Defendant’s negligent conduct also constitutes an unfair or deceptive act in commerce to the extent it disregards consumers’ safety obligations.  

30. Plaintiff is entitled to compensation for medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, and all other damages allowed under **Massachusetts tort law**. *Alegria v. Payonk*, 101 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 137 (2022) (recoverable damages for pain and suffering and lost wages).
