2. Defendant **William Carter** (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the premises at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

**II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. On or about August 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, MA, for a monthly rent of $2,200.  

5. During the winter of 2024–2025, beginning around December 2024, the heating system in the leased premises repeatedly malfunctioned, causing interior temperatures to drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for periods lasting several hours, particularly in the evenings.  

6. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the inadequate heat. Defendant arranged for repair visits on two occasions, but the repairs failed to remedy the recurring problem.  

7. Defendant’s second repair technician acknowledged that the boiler serving the apartment was “old but functional,” and stated there was “not much more to do.”  

8. Despite knowledge of the continuing defect and Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant failed to ensure that the heating system provided consistent, adequate heat as required by law.  

9. As a result of the inadequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and operate two electric space heaters to maintain a habitable temperature, incurring additional electric expenses of approximately $150 per month during the winter months.  

10. In January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis, which her physician attributed in part to prolonged exposure to cold indoor air. Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred medical expenses for antibiotics.  

11. Plaintiff has fully performed all obligations under the tenancy agreement, including payment of rent.  

12. Defendant’s failure to maintain reliable, sufficient heat in the premises substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.  

13. The statutory minimum legal heat requirement in Massachusetts mandates that residential landlords maintain a temperature of at least 68°F from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and at least 64°F at all other times. See 105 C.M.R. § 410.201.  

14. Defendant’s failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code and breaches the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

**III. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

15. Plaintiff reaffirms and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 14 above.  

16. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises.  

17. Defendant’s failure to provide heat adequate to maintain sanitary and legally required temperatures constitutes interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy as a matter of law.  

18. Massachusetts courts recognize that persistent heating failures constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91** (1982) (repeated flooding and landlord inaction constituted interference with quiet enjoyment); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714** (1977) (noise from a lounge operated by landlord’s tenant amounted to breach of quiet enjoyment); *Lowery v. Robinson*, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982** (1982) (inadequate heat violated G.L. c. 186, § 14).  

19. The duty of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to use the premises for the purposes for which they were rented, free from interference by the landlord. *Winchester v. O’Brien*, **266 Mass. 33** (1929); *Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.*, **437 Mass. 708** (2002).  

20. Defendant’s acts and omissions—specifically, failure to provide consistent heat and disregard of recurring complaints—constitute constructive interference and a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, **410 Mass. 855** (1991); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847** (1997).  

21. The State Sanitary Code’s minimum standards for heat are enforceable under the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord fails to comply. *Lis v. Mullen*, **5 Mass. App. Ct. 914** (1977); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, **379 Mass. 196** (1979).  

22. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including increased heating expenses, medical costs, and loss of work time, totaling approximately $600.  

23. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent as statutory damages, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  

24. Defendant’s conduct was at least negligent and willful, given his continuing failure to remedy the defect after repeated notice. See *Leardi v. Brown*, **394 Mass. 151** (1985) (statutory remedies under § 14 do not require showing of malice).

**IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

B. Award Plaintiff the greater of actual damages ($600) or three months’ rent ($6,600) as provided by statute;  

C. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

**V. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
