### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

### I. INTRODUCTION

This is an action brought by the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), against her landlord, Michael Richards (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, §14. Plaintiff seeks damages resulting from ongoing severe noise, dust, and disruption caused by Defendant’s renovation project in the adjacent apartment unit at 45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of her home.

---

### II. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff Emily Johnson** is an individual residing at 45 River Street, Apartment [number omitted for privacy], Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.  
2. **Defendant Michael Richards** is an individual residing at or owning real property located at 45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and is the owner and landlord of the building in which Plaintiff resides.

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19C and G.L. c. 186, §14, as this is a landlord-tenant matter involving a residential lease within the Cambridge District Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  
4. Venue is proper in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department because the leased premises are located within this district, and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred here.

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 15, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant for an apartment at 45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, at a monthly rent of $1,800.  
6. Defendant is presently Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14.  
7. Beginning on or about October 1, 2025, Defendant commenced substantial renovation and construction work in the apartment unit immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s unit.  
8. The renovation project has involved loud drilling, hammering, and other construction-related noise nearly every weekday from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. for the past two months.  
9. The disruptions have continued without significant interruption through the date of this filing, with Defendant indicating that construction may continue for another one to two months.  
10. The noise and vibrations have been so intrusive that Plaintiff has been unable to effectively conduct her remote work, which requires frequent phone and video conferences.  
11. Dust and debris from the construction regularly enter Plaintiff’s apartment through the shared ventilation system, creating an unhealthy and unpleasant living environment.  
12. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the severity of these disturbances, but the Defendant has failed to remedy the problem or offer an adequate form of relief.  
13. Defendant acknowledged the construction activity and offered Plaintiff a single rent discount of $100, which is grossly insufficient to compensate for the ongoing distress, loss of use, and reduced habitability of the unit.  
14. Plaintiff has continuously performed all obligations under her tenancy agreement, including timely payment of rent.  
15. Defendant’s actions and omissions have substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages including loss of use and enjoyment of her home, emotional distress, and disruption to her work and daily life, in an amount estimated at approximately $3,000.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

17. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  
18. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
19. Defendant’s conduct—including excessive and prolonged construction noise, dust infiltration, and failure to mitigate or prevent ongoing disturbances—constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her leased premises.  
20. Defendant’s interference was intentional or, at minimum, undertaken with knowledge that such disturbances would unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
21. Defendant did not make adequate accommodations to protect Plaintiff from foreseeable impacts of the renovation, nor did he provide temporary relocation, air filtration, or meaningful rent abatement.  
22. Massachusetts law recognizes that a tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment is violated when the landlord’s actions substantially impair the character and value of the tenancy. See, e.g.:  
   - **Simon v. Solomon,** 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (a landlord’s negligence and failure to remedy disturbances constituted breach of quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Blackett v. Olanoff,** 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable when disturbances from operations under his control interfered with tenants’ quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Winograd v. Levine,** 43 Mass. App. Ct. 308 (1997) (repeated noise and odors from adjacent premises under landlord’s control section found to violate covenant);  
   - **Lowery v. Robinson,** 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (construction noise and disruption can constitute quiet enjoyment breach where foreseeable and substantial);  
   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis,** 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (tenant entitled to recover under §14 even for indirect interference);  
   - **Dolben Co. v. Friedmann,** 1 Mass. App. Ct. 701 (1974) (quiet enjoyment protects tenant against material disturbance by landlord’s actions or omissions);  
   - **Morrison v. Lennett,** 415 Mass. 857 (1993) (physical condition and landlord actions may impair quiet enjoyment without eviction);  
   - **G.L. c. 186, §14** (statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment);  
   - **G.L. c. 239, §2A** (providing remedies for violations of tenant rights); and  
   - **G.L. c. 93A, §9** (recognizing unfair or deceptive practices arising from breaches of tenant statutory rights).  
23. Plaintiff’s situation closely parallels *Blackett v. Olanoff,* in which the Supreme Judicial Court found that disturbances and noise from activities under a landlord’s control, even when performed by third parties, constitute a statutory breach.  
24. Defendant’s renovation is an activity solely within his control and thus his failure to protect Plaintiff from its direct effects is actionable.  
25. Defendant’s offer of nominal rent reduction does not absolve his responsibility nor constitute an adequate remedy for statutory damages.  
26. Accordingly, Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment as provided by G.L. c. 186, §14, and Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent—whichever is greater—plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

### VI. DAMAGES

27. Plaintiff has suffered damages including but not limited to:  
   a. Emotional distress, frustration, and loss of peace of mind due to constant noise and dust;  
   b. Impairment of her ability to conduct remote work from home;  
   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of portions of her unit; and  
   d. Economic loss in the amount of approximately $3,000.  
28. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff seeks three months’ rent ($5,400) as statutory damages or actual damages, whichever amount is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages of three months’ rent ($5,400) or actual damages in the amount of $3,000, whichever is greater;  
C. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and attorney’s fees as allowed by statute;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
