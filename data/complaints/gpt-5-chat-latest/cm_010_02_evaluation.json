The user seeks analysis on whether a case supports the legal proposition that \"The Court\u2019s paramount consideration is always the best interests of the child.\" The AI reviews the case, which affirms that in custody matters, the touchstone inquiry involves what is \"best for the child,\" and references statutes and previous case law confirming that the best interests of the child remain paramount. The AI concludes that the opinion strongly supports the proposition, noting its explicit endorsement and application of the best-interests standard for custody determinations under Massachusetts law. It provides a concise explanation, citing relevant excerpts that explicitly refer to the best interests of the child as the primary and longstanding standard used by the courts.```"
