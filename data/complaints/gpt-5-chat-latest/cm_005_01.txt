**DOCKET NO. [________]**  

**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL BROWN,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28; ch. 209C, § 20; and related authority)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapters 208 and 209C for a **Modification of the existing custody order** entered by this Court on **April 12, 2022**, in the matter concerning the minor children **Emily Brown (age 10)** and **Noah Brown (age 8)**.  

---

### I. PARTIES
1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of Emily and Noah Brown and presently exercises the majority of parenting time as ordered.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Brown, the father of the minor children, also residing within Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28**, and **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20**, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify judgments regarding custody and parenting time upon a material and substantial change in circumstances.  
4. Venue in Bristol County is proper because both parties and the children reside in the county, and the prior judgment was entered by this Court.

---

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT
5. On **April 12, 2022**, this Honorable Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** granting joint legal custody to the parties, with the Plaintiff designated as the primary residential parent and the Defendant exercising parenting time on alternating weekends and other agreed-upon periods.  
6. The judgment also required both parents to foster the children’s positive relationship with the other parent and to refrain from disparagement or interference with the parent-child relationship.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
7. Since entry of the 2022 custody judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor children.  
8. The Defendant, Michael Brown, has repeatedly **enrolled the children in extracurricular activities during the Plaintiff’s scheduled custodial weekends** without consultation or agreement, contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the prior order requiring shared legal custody and cooperative decision-making.  
9. The Defendant has **made disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff to the children**, including telling them that their mother is “selfish” and that she “does not really love them,” when disagreements arise about scheduling or parenting time.  
10. As a result of these behaviors, the children have demonstrated **heightened anxiety** surrounding transitions between households—specifically, Emily reports stomach aches and emotional distress on exchange days.  
11. The Defendant’s conduct undermines the children’s sense of security and stability and **interferes with the Plaintiff’s ability to exercise parenting time** consistent with the Judgment.  
12. These actions represent a substantial change in circumstances that were **not reasonably anticipated** at the time of the prior custody order, thereby justifying a modification under Massachusetts law.

---

### V. APPLICABLE LAW
13. Under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28**, a custody judgment may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification serves the best interest of the child.  
14. Similarly, **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20** provides that any custody or parenting judgment concerning unmarried parents may be modified upon a showing of material change and best interests.  
15. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that **custody may be modified when changed circumstances affect the child’s welfare or where cooperation between parents has broken down**. (*See* *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)).  
16. The controlling standard remains the **best interests of the child**, as articulated in *Bluhm v. Bluhm*, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2007), and *White v. Laingor*, 434 Mass. 64 (2001).  
17. Courts have recognized that ongoing parental conflict and disparagement can constitute a sufficient change in circumstances. (*See* *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000)).  
18. Interference with another parent’s custody or parenting time is further grounds for modification. (*See* *Rosenthal v. Maney*, supra; *Malachi M. v. Quentin N.*, 484 Mass. 418 (2020)).  
19. Massachusetts appellate precedent holds that failure to cooperate in joint legal custody decisions may warrant granting sole legal custody to one parent. (*See* *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)).  
20. Provisions of **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 31** establish the statutory framework for joint and sole custody determinations, emphasizing that mutual respect and communication are prerequisites to effective joint custody.  
21. The totality of the circumstances here—parental interference, disparagement, and adverse effects on the children’s emotional well-being—shows that the **best interests of Emily and Noah** would be served by modifying custody to provide a structure of stability and clarity consistent with Massachusetts case law.

### VI. REQUESTED RELIEF
**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Modify the Judgment of April 12, 2022**, to award the Plaintiff **sole legal custody** of the minor children, or in the alternative, clarify and limit legal custody to ensure that major educational and extracurricular decisions are made in consultation but subject to the Plaintiff’s final determination when impasse occurs;  

B. Modify the physical custody and parenting schedule to reflect that the children shall **reside primarily with the Plaintiff**, with visitation by the Defendant as the Court deems appropriate and in the children’s best interests;  

C. Order that both parties shall refrain from making **disparaging remarks** about the other parent in the presence of the children and that all communications concerning the children shall be conducted **respectfully and in writing**, except in emergencies;  

D. Clarify that **extracurricular scheduling decisions** shall not interfere with the other parent’s scheduled parenting time unless by mutual written agreement;  

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper in accordance with the best interests of Emily and Noah Brown.
