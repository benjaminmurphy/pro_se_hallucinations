### **COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff **Jordan Thompson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555‑0123 or via email at psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. Defendant **Mark Williams** (“Defendant”) is an individual whose residence is believed to be in Massachusetts and who, at all relevant times, operated a motor vehicle for a rideshare company within the City of Boston.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4** because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and the cause of action arises within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

4. Venue is proper in **Suffolk County** under **G.L. c. 223, § 1** because the tort occurred in Boston, Suffolk County.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **August 12, 2023**, Plaintiff was riding his bicycle lawfully within a marked bicycle lane on 17th Street in **Boston, Massachusetts**.  

6. Plaintiff was obeying all traffic laws, wearing a helmet, and exercising reasonable care for his own safety.  

7. At the same time and place, Defendant was operating or in charge of a rideshare vehicle that was parked unlawfully or improperly in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  

8. Without warning and **without first checking for approaching cyclists**, Defendant **suddenly opened his vehicle door** directly into the bicycle lane and into Plaintiff’s immediate path of travel.  

9. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision. The door struck Plaintiff and caused him to be thrown from his bicycle onto the pavement.  

10. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff sustained **road rash on both arms and legs**, a **chipped front tooth**, and **damage to his bicycle’s frame**.  

11. Plaintiff incurred **medical expenses of approximately $1,500**, including costs for emergency care and dental repair, as well as **lost wages of approximately $800** from missed workdays.  

12. Defendant admitted at the scene that he **“didn’t see”** Plaintiff because he was **checking his phone** rather than ensuring that it was safe to open his vehicle door.  

13. Defendant subsequently provided false information to his insurer, claiming Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” which Plaintiff denies.  

14. Plaintiff has suffered physical injuries, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and financial losses as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE**

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, a person owes a duty to exercise **reasonable care** in the operation and control of a motor vehicle to avoid foreseeable injury to others. See **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, requiring motorists to ensure it is safe before opening any vehicle door on a public way; see also *Carter v. Yardley & Co.*, 319 Mass. 92 (1946) (defining negligence as the failure to exercise the care of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances).  

17. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful bicyclist on a public way, a duty of care to act reasonably and to refrain from opening his car door into the path of travel. See *Vega v. Walsh*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1034 (1989); *Glanz v. Gabor*, 374 Mass. 814 (1978); *Poirier v. Plymouth*, 374 Mass. 206 (1978).  

18. Defendant breached that duty by:
   a. Failing to check for oncoming bicycles before opening his door;  
   b. Opening his vehicle door into an active bike lane;  
   c. Failing to devote full attention to surrounding traffic conditions; and  
   d. Distractedly using his mobile phone while parked adjacent to traffic.  

19. Defendant’s conduct violated **G.L. c. 90, § 14** and constituted negligence per se under Massachusetts law. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990) (violation of statutory duty is evidence of negligence); *Lyon v. Morphew*, 424 Mass. 828 (1997).  

20. Defendant’s breach of duty was the **direct and proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. See *Jex v. Jex*, 432 Mass. 533 (2000); *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101 (1978).  

21. Plaintiff was at all times exercising due care and did not contribute to the cause of the collision. See *Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.*, 388 Mass. 342, 355 (1983) (plaintiff’s due care presumed unless shown otherwise); *Asiala v. Fitchburg*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 13 (1987).  

22. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained permanent and serious injury, incurred medical and dental expenses, lost income, suffered emotional distress, and endured pain and suffering.  

---

### **V. DAMAGES**

23. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing and alleges that as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent actions, Plaintiff sustained damages including but not limited to:  
   - Medical expenses: approximately **$1,500**;  
   - Lost wages: approximately **$800**;  
   - Property damage to his bicycle; and  
   - Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and inconvenience.  

24. Plaintiff therefore claims damages in an amount **to be determined at trial**, but reasonably believed to exceed **$25,000**, exclusive of interest and costs.  

---

### **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jordan Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter **judgment** in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Mark Williams** for negligence;  
B. Award Plaintiff **compensatory damages** in an amount to be determined at trial;  
C. Award **pre‑ and post‑judgment interest** pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
D. Award **costs of suit**; and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### **VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38(b)**.
