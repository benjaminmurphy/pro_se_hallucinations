### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)

Plaintiff **Jennifer Lee (“Plaintiff”)**, by way of Complaint against **Mark Thompson (“Defendant”)**, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff **Jennifer Lee** is an individual residing at **123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01108**, in Hampden County.  

2. Defendant **Mark Thompson** is an individual residing at the same duplex property, **123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01108**, and is the co-owner or tenant of that property.  

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Hampden County and the damages exceed $50,000.  

4. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for maintaining his personal property located on or near the shared driveway at the residence.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff and Defendant share a duplex property and a common driveway located at 123 Elm Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  

6. Defendant had a tall aluminum extension ladder, which he regularly stored by leaning it unsecured against a wooden fence next to the driveway area where Plaintiff parked her vehicle.  

7. Plaintiff expressed her concern to Defendant on multiple occasions that the ladder posed a hazard and might fall, especially during windy conditions.  

8. On or about **March 15, 2023**, during a period of high wind, the ladder, left unsecured and leaning against the fence, was blown over.  

9. The ladder crashed onto Plaintiff’s vehicle as she was backing into the driveway, causing substantial damage to the hood and windshield.  

10. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the incident and sought compensation for repair costs.  

11. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses including her auto insurance deductible, the cost of renting a car while her vehicle was being repaired, and repair costs for the damaged hood and windshield.  

12. The vehicle damage caused Plaintiff inconvenience and economic loss.  

13. Defendant had previously acknowledged the potential danger but negligently failed to tie down, secure, or otherwise relocate the ladder to prevent foreseeable harm.  

14. Defendant’s acts and omissions constituted a breach of his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff as a nearby resident using the shared premises.  

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage and other consequential economic losses.

### III. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, “Every person is bound to exercise reasonable care to avoid naturally and probably injuring another person by his act.” **Glannon v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., LLC, 467 Mass. 697, 700 (2014)**.  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to maintain his property and possessions, including the ladder, in a manner that avoided creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others using the shared premises. See **Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006)** (duty arises when harm is foreseeable).  

19. Defendant breached that duty by:  
   a. Storing the ladder in an unstable and unsecured position adjacent to a shared driveway;  
   b. Ignoring repeated warnings of its potential danger; and  
   c. Failing to properly secure or remove the ladder despite foreseeable risk.  

20. Massachusetts law imposes liability for the negligent maintenance of property that foreseeably causes harm. See **Griffin v. Loftin, 345 Mass. 683 (1963)**; **Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013)**; and **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence statute).  

21. Defendant’s conduct directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s property damage, measured by the reasonable cost to repair the vehicle and related expenses. See **McDonough v. Whalen, 365 Mass. 506, 512 (1974)** (damages in negligence compensate for losses caused by defendant’s breach).  

22. Defendant’s conduct exhibits a failure to act as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances. See **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283 (1965)**, adopted in **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)**.  

23. Defendant’s breach was the factual and legal cause of Plaintiff’s harm under the “but for” and foreseeability standards. See **Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 318 (2002)**; **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978)**.  

24. Plaintiff’s damages include cost of repairs, car rental, insurance deductible, and other related expenses.  

25. Plaintiff was not contributorily negligent under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and at all times exercised ordinary care in her use of the shared driveway.  

26. Plaintiff therefore seeks compensatory damages allowed under Massachusetts law. See **Guinard v. Knapp, 86 Mass. App. Ct. 648 (2014)** (plaintiff may recover for foreseeable property damage due to neighbor’s negligence); **Tantimonaco v. Allstate Ins. Co., 451 Mass. 547, 553 (2008)** (negligent acts resulting in property damage are compensable).

### IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jennifer Lee** respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant **Mark Thompson**, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:  
   1. Vehicle repair costs;  
   2. Auto rental expenses; and  
   3. Insurance deductible amounts;  

B. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as provided by **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  

C. Costs of this action; and  

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
