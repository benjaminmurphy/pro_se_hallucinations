### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **February 15, 2023**, a heavy snowstorm impacted Worcester, Massachusetts.  

6. The Defendant, as landlord and caretaker of the three‑unit apartment building at **123 Maple Street**, had a duty to maintain the premises and adjoining sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition and to take reasonable steps to remove or treat accumulations of snow and ice. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 435 Mass. 353 (2001).  

7. Defendant shoveled a narrow walkway through the snow but failed to apply salt, sand, or other treatments to prevent refreezing.  

8. Over the next two days, due to typical melting and refreezing, the shoveled area became covered with a sheet of ice.  

9. Tenants of the property notified Defendant through text messages and sent photographs of the icy condition, to which Defendant allegedly responded that “the sun will take care of it.”  

10. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff lawfully entered the property’s sidewalk area to deliver groceries to one of the tenants.  

11. While walking on the walkway provided by Defendant, Plaintiff slipped on the ice, fell backwards, and landed on her lower back, suffering painful injuries.  

12. Defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition given prior warnings from tenants and the foreseeable refreezing. *See Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).  

13. Defendant’s failure to treat or otherwise make safe the icy walkway constituted a breach of her duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law. *See Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

14. Plaintiff’s injuries included a lower back injury requiring medical evaluation and treatment.  

15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500 in medical expenses** and suffered approximately **$800 in lost wages**, as well as physical pain, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.  

16. Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition. *See Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837 (1987).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if set forth fully herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts law, property owners and those in control of premises owe all lawful entrants a duty to act with reasonable care to maintain the property in a safe condition and to remedy or warn of dangerous conditions of which they know or reasonably should know. *See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Bernier v. Boston Edison Co.*, 380 Mass. 372 (1980).  

19. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things:  
   a. failing to adequately remove snow and ice from the sidewalk and walkway;  
   b. failing to apply salt, sand, or other de‑icing materials after foreseeable refreezing;  
   c. ignoring multiple tenant warnings and photographs documenting the condition; and  
   d. failing to inspect and maintain the walkway despite knowledge of the hazardous condition.  

20. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. *See Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).  

21. Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, incurred medical costs, and lost wages. She also suffered pain and suffering, and impairment of her ability to carry on usual activities.  

22. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 60F**, Plaintiff seeks compensation for all damages allowed by law.
