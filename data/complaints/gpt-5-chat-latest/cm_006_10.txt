**JESSICA THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL JOHNSON**,  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on May 15, 2021. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Liam Johnson (born [insert date]) and Ava Johnson (born [insert date]).

2. The Defendant, **Michael Johnson**, is the father of the minor children and resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and related statutory authority governing domestic relations and modification actions.

---

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On **May 15, 2021**, a judgment entered in the **Norfolk Probate and Family Court** granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the parties’ two minor children, with the Defendant having parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.  

5. The judgment was based on the circumstances existing at that time, which included that neither party was cohabitating or involved in any relationship affecting the welfare of the children.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. Since the entry of the said judgment, there has been a **substantial and material change in circumstances** materially affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children.

7. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, now resides with a new partner who has a **criminal record involving assault and battery** and has previously been the subject of a **restraining order** obtained by a former girlfriend.

8. The Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore avers, that this individual’s behavior around the children has been **angry, volatile, and physically aggressive**. The children have reported yelling, door slamming, and one incident where this person **grabbed a child’s arm tightly enough to leave a visible mark.**

9. A **neighbor contacted law enforcement** following a loud argument occurring when the children were present at the Defendant’s residence, demonstrating a continued pattern of instability and potential danger.

10. These developments were neither known nor reasonably foreseeable at the time of the original custody order, constituting a **material change** warranting judicial reconsideration under Massachusetts law.

---

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

11. It is well-established that **the controlling consideration in any custody determination is the best interests of the child**. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

12. A change in custody or parenting terms is appropriate where new developments pose a **risk to the children’s emotional or physical well-being**. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

13. A party seeking modification must show a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the original order, as provided by *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).

14. Massachusetts courts have held that exposure of children to domestic conflict and violence may constitute grounds for modification. *Garside v. Garside*, 396 Mass. 789 (1986); *Adoption of Frederick*, 405 Mass. 1 (1989).

15. Furthermore, *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) and *M.G.L. c. 208, § 31A* direct the court to consider any history of abuse or risk of harm to the child’s physical or emotional health in determining custody and parenting time.

16. The presence of a person with a violent history in the household, coupled with physical aggression toward a child, **constitutes a significant risk of harm** and justifies modification of the parenting order.

17. In accordance with *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981), modification is appropriate where the living situation of a custodial or non-custodial parent creates risk or instability inconsistent with the children’s best interests.

---

### V. REQUESTED RELIEF

18. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an **Order Modifying Custody/Parenting Time** as follows:

   a. That all visitation or parenting time of the Defendant occur **without the presence** of the Defendant’s current cohabitant who has a criminal and violent history;  

   b. In the alternative, that the Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised** at an approved visitation center or by a neutral, court-approved supervisor;  

   c. That such further and other relief as justice and equity require be granted.

---

### VI. LEGAL GROUNDS

19. This request for modification is filed pursuant to:
   - **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** (Modification of judgments relative to custody and support);  
   - **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20** (Modification of judgment or order concerning custody for children born out of wedlock);  
   - **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31A** (Consideration of abuse and risk of harm in custody determinations);  
   - Relevant case law including *Custody of Kali*, *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, *Garside v. Garside*, *Rolde v. Rolde*, *Pizzino v. Miller*, *Rosenthal v. Maney*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Hale v. Hale*, *Adoption of Frederick*, and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*.

20. Under these authorities, the Plaintiff has met the burden of demonstrating a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that affects the welfare of the children, and modification is therefore warranted.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the May 15, 2021 judgment;  
2. Modify the existing custody order to include conditions protecting the minor children from exposure to individuals with a history of violence or restraining orders;  
3. Order supervised visitation for the Defendant, or in the alternative, prohibit the Defendant’s current cohabitant from being present during parenting time;  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.
