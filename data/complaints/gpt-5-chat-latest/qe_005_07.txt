### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written residential tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent the second-floor apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, for $1,800 per month.

6. The lease agreement expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to the **quiet enjoyment** of the leased premises.

7. Beginning on or about **June 1, 2025**, tenants renting the third-floor apartment in the same building became a persistent source of **loud and excessive noise**, consisting of heavy footsteps, stomping, loud music late at night, and furniture being moved at late hours, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment of her apartment.

8. On numerous occasions—at least **five or six times**—Plaintiff complained directly to Defendant regarding the excessive noise and its disruption of her sleep and health.

9. Defendant took minimal or no corrective action, speaking to the third-floor tenants only once and subsequently stating that he “can’t control how people live.”

10. Defendant has continued to collect full rent from Plaintiff while failing to remedy the ongoing disturbance that substantially interferes with her use and enjoyment of the premises.

11. As a direct result of Defendant’s inaction and failure to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered **loss of sleep**, **physical and emotional distress**, **medical expenses** (including $40 per month in sleep medication), and a **written warning** at work for falling asleep on the job.

12. Plaintiff has incurred and continues to incur damages of at least **$1,200**, including lost quiet enjoyment, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and diminished value of the rental premises.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises, or who fails to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable and substantial interference by other tenants, violates the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.

15. The covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees that a tenant shall not be substantially disturbed in the use and enjoyment of leased premises by the landlord or by others whose conduct the landlord could reasonably control. *See Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

16. Defendant had actual notice of the noise disturbances caused by the third-floor tenants and had the **power and obligation** to take reasonable measures—such as warnings, lease enforcement, or eviction proceedings—to prevent continued interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

17. Defendant’s failure and refusal to take such steps constitute an **indirect interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. *See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

18. The interference experienced by Plaintiff has been both **substantial** and **ongoing**, depriving her of her lawful right to the use and enjoyment of her home. *See Winchester v. O'Brien*, 266 Mass. 33 (1929); *Westland Hous. Corp. v. Scott*, 312 Mass. 375 (1942); *Doe v. Cooperative Cent. Bank*, 426 Mass. 290 (1997); *Fitzgerald v. Congleton*, 155 Mass. 155 (1892).

19. The harm suffered by Plaintiff falls squarely within the statute’s protection and entitles her to the **actual and statutory damages** set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, (although Plaintiff is pro se). *See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

### IV. DAMAGES

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment:

   a. Plaintiff has lost the use and enjoyment of her apartment;  
   b. Plaintiff has suffered physical, emotional, and psychological distress;  
   c. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses and the cost of sleep medication; and  
   d. Plaintiff has suffered loss of work productivity and reputational harm at her place of employment.

21. Plaintiff calculates her total damages at **$1,200**, plus interest, and reserves the right to amend this amount following discovery or trial.

22. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, together with **reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.**

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award Plaintiff **statutory damages** of the greater of $1,200 or three (3) months’ rent ($5,400);  
C. Award Plaintiff **interest and costs** pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6C;  
D. Award **reasonable attorney’s fees** per G.L. c. 186, § 14 (acknowledging Plaintiff proceeds pro se); and  
E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
