Plaintiff,  
v.  
**RYAN SMITH,**  
Defendant.  

Civil Action No. _______  

---

### **COMPLAINT**

Plaintiff Mark Johnson (“Plaintiff”), for his Complaint against Defendant Ryan Smith (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Mark Johnson is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Ryan Smith is an individual residing in Massachusetts and was at all relevant times operating or in control of a motor vehicle in Suffolk County.  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the cause of action arose in Suffolk County, and the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.  
4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant pursuant to **G.L. c. 223A, § 3**, because Defendant committed a tortious act within the Commonwealth.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On September 12, 2023, at approximately 8:15 a.m., Plaintiff was lawfully riding his bicycle in a marked bike lane along 55 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet, maintaining a proper speed, and adhering to all applicable traffic laws pursuant to **G.L. c. 85, § 11B**, which grants cyclists the same rights and responsibilities as motorists.  
7. Defendant was operating or in control of a vehicle used for rideshare activities and had parked in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  
8. Without observing or checking for oncoming cyclists, Defendant suddenly and negligently opened his driver-side door into the active bike lane.  
9. Defendant’s abrupt action caused Plaintiff to collide with the door, throwing him from his bicycle to the pavement.  
10. Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including road rash on both arms and legs, a chipped upper front tooth, and damage to his bicycle frame.  
11. At the scene, Defendant admitted he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone just prior to opening the door.  
12. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $1,500, lost wages in the amount of approximately $500, and suffered additional consequential losses related to bicycle replacement and dental restoration.  
13. Defendant subsequently made inconsistent statements to his insurer, denying fault and alleging that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” which was false and contrary to Defendant’s original admission of negligence.  
14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent actions, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, incurred economic loss, and suffered physical and emotional pain.

---

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as though fully stated herein.  
16. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to operate and control his motor vehicle and to open his door in a manner that would avoid causing harm to foreseeable users of the public way, including cyclists. See **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, which expressly prohibits opening a vehicle door unless it is reasonably safe to do so.  
17. Defendant breached this duty when he failed to look for oncoming bicyclists before opening his car door into the bike lane.  
18. Defendant’s actions constituted a violation of **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, and such violation constitutes evidence of negligence as recognized in **Hersum v. Kenney**, 341 Mass. 189 (1960).  
19. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.  
20. Plaintiff’s injuries were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s conduct.  
21. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered physical injury, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, property damage, and economic losses.

### **V. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES**

22. Under Massachusetts law, negligence is the failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances. See **Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth.**, 905 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1990); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (1999).  
23. Motorists have an affirmative duty to exercise due care toward cyclists lawfully using the road. See **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 90, § 14**; **Commonwealth v. Campbell**, 394 Mass. 77 (1985).  
24. Violation of a safety statute may constitute negligence per se. See **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355 (1990).  
25. A driver’s failure to maintain proper vigilance when opening a car door constitutes actionable negligence. See **Sobel v. Jones**, 302 Mass. 600 (1939); **Kelly v. Buckley**, 306 Mass. 558 (1940).  
26. A plaintiff may recover damages for both economic and noneconomic losses incurred as a result of another’s negligence. See **Conley v. Moran**, 349 Mass. 624 (1965).  
27. A bicyclist operating lawfully has full rights to use the roadway. See **G.L. c. 85, § 11B**; **St. Germain v. Pfeifer**, 418 Mass. 511 (1994).  
28. Foreseeability of harm to a bicyclist determines the scope of duty. See **Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.**, 388 Mass. 342 (1983).  
29. A defendant is liable for damages that are the natural and probable consequences of his negligent conduct. See **Cyr v. J.I. Case Co.**, 363 Mass. 623 (1973).  
30. Comparative negligence does not bar recovery if Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was less than fifty percent (50%) of the total causal negligence. See **G.L. c. 231, § 85**; **Zeller v. Cantu**, 395 Mass. 76 (1985).

### **VI. DAMAGES**

31. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Medical expenses – approximately $1,500;  
   b. Lost wages – approximately $500;  
   c. Damage to bicycle and related property – approximately $1,000;  
   d. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   e. Other consequential damages.  

32. Plaintiff continues to experience discomfort, inconvenience, and anxiety related to cycling and commuting as a result of the incident.

### **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant as follows:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably expected to exceed **$50,000**;
