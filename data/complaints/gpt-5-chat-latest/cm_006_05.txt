# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

---

**I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children **Emily Smith (age 10)** and **Lucas Smith (age 8)**. Her contact information is: (617) 555-0123, email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. Defendant, **James Smith**, is the father of the minor children and resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

---

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction under **G.L. c. 208, §28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §20**, and **G.L. c. 215, §6** to modify prior custody and visitation orders where a material and substantial change in circumstances affects the welfare of the children.  

4. Venue is proper in the **Bristol Probate and Family Court**, where the original judgment of custody was entered on **June 15, 2021**, and where the minor children continue to reside and attend school.

---

**III. PRIOR ORDER**

5. On **June 15, 2021**, a Judgment of Custody and Support issued from this Court granting primary physical custody of the children to the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and parenting time to the Defendant, James Smith, consisting of alternating weekends and one midweek visit.  

6. The prior judgment was entered when both parents were single and no significant third-party involvement affected the children’s health, safety, or welfare.

---

**IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since entry of the 2021 custody order, the Defendant has entered into a cohabiting relationship with an individual who has a **criminal record for assault and battery** and a prior **restraining order** issued against him/her by a former partner.  

8. The Defendant’s live-in partner has displayed **volatile and intimidating behavior** in the presence of the children, including **yelling, slamming doors**, and on one occasion **grabbing one child’s arm** forcefully enough to leave a visible mark.  

9. A **neighbor contacted the police** during a loud domestic altercation involving the Defendant and this partner while the children were present.  

10. These events demonstrate a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that was not anticipated at the time of the original judgment. The environment during the Defendant’s parenting time has become unsafe and emotionally harmful to the children.  

11. Under **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**, and **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**, modification of custody or visitation is appropriate where circumstances have substantially changed and continued enforcement of the existing order is not in the child’s best interests.

12. The conduct described violates the principle that custody and visitation shall at all times promote the **best interests of the children**, consistent with **G.L. c. 208, §31**, and **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**.

13. The Defendant’s current living situation raises substantial concerns regarding the **children’s safety and emotional well-being**, warranting a modification to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place.

---

**V. APPLICABLE LAW AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITIES**

14. A Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody judgment upon proof of a **material and substantial change of circumstances** under **G.L. c. 208, §28** and **Sawyer v. Sawyer, 448 Mass. 1001 (2006)**.

15. The paramount consideration in any modification is the **best interests of the child** (*Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976)).  

16. Courts have recognized the need to intervene when the environment during parenting time endangers a child’s emotional or physical health (*Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)).  

17. The presence of individuals with violent histories or volatile behavior can justify supervised visitation or restriction of exposure (*Adoption of Vito*, 431 Mass. 550 (2000); *Custody of Eleanor*, 414 Mass. 795 (1993)).  

18. A parent’s right to custody or visitation is not absolute and must yield to the child’s safety and welfare (*Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)).  

19. Under **G.L. c. 209C, §20**, the Court has continuing power to modify custody arrangements as justice and the children’s welfare require.

---

**VI. REQUESTED RELIEF**

Accordingly, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Modify the current custody and visitation order** entered June 15, 2021, finding that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred.  

B. Order that the Defendant’s current live-in partner **shall not be present during any periods of parenting time** with Emily and Lucas **or**, in the alternative, that all parenting time **shall be supervised** by a professional agency or mutually agreed supervised visitation center until further order of the Court.  

C. Require the Defendant to complete an **anger management or parenting education program** approved by the Court.  

D. Grant such further relief as justice and the best interests of the children may require.  

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, the Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, respectfully prays that this Court:

1. Determine that a material and substantial change has occurred affecting the children’s welfare since the Judgment of June 15, 2021.  
2. Modify the parenting schedule to protect the children’s safety and well-being.  
3. Order that the Defendant’s current household composition be reviewed to ensure a stable and nonviolent environment.  
4. Grant any other relief deemed proper and equitable by this Court.
