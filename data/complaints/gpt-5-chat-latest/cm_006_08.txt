### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

---

**I. INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**

1. The Plaintiff, **Lisa Reynolds**, brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to *Massachusetts General Laws* (“M.G.L.”) c. 208, §28, and c. 209C, §20, seeking modification of the existing custody and visitation order concerning the parties’ minor children, **Emily Reynolds (age 10)** and **Jason Reynolds (age 8)**.

2. This Court, the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court**, issued the original custody judgment on **May 15, 2021**, in the above-captioned matter.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under *M.G.L. c. 215, §3*, as both parents and the children reside in Middlesex County.

---

**II. PARTIES**

4. Plaintiff **Lisa Reynolds** is the mother of the minor children and resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She may be reached at (617) 555‑0123 and by email at psm1443@gmail.com.

5. Defendant **Mark Reynolds** is the father of the minor children and currently resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

---

**III. CURRENT CUSTODY ORDER**

6. Under the judgment entered on **May 15, 2021**, the parties share **legal custody** of the minor children.  
7. The judgment granted **primary physical custody** to Lisa Reynolds and awarded **parenting time to Mark Reynolds** on alternate weekends and one midweek evening visit.

---

**IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

8. Since the entry of the custody order, a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred affecting the welfare of the children.

9. Specifically, Defendant **Mark Reynolds now resides with a live‑in partner** who has a **criminal record for assault and battery** and was previously subject to a **restraining order** for domestic violence.

10. Since moving into Defendant’s residence, this individual has displayed **violent and aggressive behavior** in the presence of the children, including yelling, slamming doors, and on one occasion grabbing one child’s arm hard enough to leave a mark.

11. The children have expressed fear and discomfort during visits. A **neighbor called the police** to Defendant’s residence after a loud argument occurred while the children were present.

12. These incidents constitute a **material and substantial change** since the 2021 custody order and create a **significant risk to the emotional and physical well‑being** of Emily and Jason.

13. Continuation of unsupervised visitation **without restriction on exposure to the live‑in partner** is contrary to the children’s best interests.

---

**V. LEGAL STANDARDS**

14. Under *M.G.L. c. 208, §28*, a custody order may be modified if the moving party demonstrates a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and that modification is in the **best interests of the children**.

15. Massachusetts case law confirms that where the safety or emotional welfare of children is at issue, the Court must act promptly and prudently to modify orders as needed.  
  a. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) – Emphasizes the “best interests of the child” as the paramount consideration in custody modifications.  
  b. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) – A substantial change affecting family stability justifies reopening a custody judgment.  
  c. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) – The child's well‑being is the central concern in post‑judgment modifications.  
  d. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) – Parental relationships exposing a child to domestic violence or unsafe conditions constitute material changes.  
  e. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) – Changes in household composition and stability are relevant to custody determinations.  
  f. *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981) – The Court may alter parenting arrangements to protect a child from exposure to harmful influences.  
  g. *Szulik v. Szulik*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 1119 (2018) (Rule 1:28 decision) – Domestic violence and risk of harm to children justify modification of parenting time.  
  h. *M.G.L. c. 208, §31A* – Directs Courts to consider evidence of abuse when making or modifying custody judgments.  
  i. *M.G.L. c. 209A, §3* – Recognizes domestic violence as a factor warranting protective relief.  
  j. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) – Stability and safety are core elements in assessing the children’s interests.  

16. The evidence described above constitutes both a **substantial change** and a **circumstantial imperative** requiring modification under these authorities.

**VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

17. Plaintiff Lisa Reynolds respectfully requests that the Court modify the Judgment of May 15, 2021, as follows:

   a. **That the Defendant’s parenting time be conditioned** on the live‑in partner’s absence from any visits with the children;  
   b. **Alternatively**, that the Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised** by an approved agency or neutral third party;  
   c. That the Defendant be ordered to **notify the Plaintiff and the Court** of any changes in residence or household companions;  
   d. That such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper be granted to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the children.

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the 2021 custody order;  
2. Modify said custody and visitation provisions to **protect the children’s best interests**;  
3. Order such other remedies as are necessary to serve the welfare and safety of the minor children, including supervised visitation or restrictions regarding Defendant’s live‑in partner; and  
4. Grant such further relief as justice and equity may require.
