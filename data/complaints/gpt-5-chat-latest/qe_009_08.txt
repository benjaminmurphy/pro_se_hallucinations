### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff, Emily Carter, for her complaint against Defendant, John Thompson, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Emily Carter** resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103, where she rents a two‑bedroom apartment from Defendant.  
2. Defendant **John Thompson** is a residential landlord doing business in Springfield, Massachusetts, and is the owner and manager of the rental premises located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (the “Premises”).  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in the Springfield Division of the District Court Department because the property that is the subject of this action is located in Springfield, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease with Defendant to rent the Premises for $1,600 per month.  
6. Plaintiff has at all times paid rent as required and performed her obligations under the lease.  
7. Beginning approximately **six weeks** prior to the date of this Complaint, one of the bedrooms in the Premises has been without electrical power. The overhead light and all outlets in that room are nonfunctional.  
8. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the defect. Defendant sent an electrician who determined the problem required a substantial wiring repair.  
9. Defendant has failed and refused to timely repair the electrical failure, claiming it is “complicated” due to the building’s age.  
10. The defect has rendered one bedroom completely unusable. Plaintiff had used that room as a home office, but she now cannot work there.  
11. Plaintiff has incurred out‑of‑pocket costs to find alternative workspaces, including approximately **$15 per day** at coffee shops and a **$150 per‑month** coworking membership.  
12. Plaintiff’s belongings from the disused room now crowd the living area, making the apartment uncomfortable and diminishing its intended use and value.  
13. Defendant has had notice of the defective condition for more than thirty days and has not made the repair or offered any rent abatement.  
14. As a result, Defendant has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–14.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  
17. Defendant’s failure to maintain essential electrical service to a portion of the apartment constitutes an interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  
18. Massachusetts law imposes upon landlords an implied covenant that tenants shall have the right to quiet enjoyment. *See* **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).**  
19. The persistent loss of electricity constitutes a serious defect that materially impairs the tenant’s use of the property and violates the covenant. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)** (landlord’s failure to correct condition substantially interfering with tenant’s comfort supports liability under § 14).  
20. Defendant’s inaction, despite notice, is an “indirect act” of interference explicitly covered by § 14. *See* **Chalmers v. Commonwealth Realty Trust**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982)**.  
21. Landlords are strictly liable under § 14 for violations once notice is provided. *See* **Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997)**; **Lowery v. Robbins**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**.  
22. Defendant’s conduct also violates **105 C.M.R. 410.351** and **105 C.M.R. 410.750**, which require that electrical facilities be maintained in good working order—a condition of lawful occupancy under **G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L**.  
23. Courts have held that failure to maintain essential utilities, even when caused by neglect rather than intent, breaches quiet enjoyment. *See* **Haddad v. Giacosa**, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 547 (1994)**; **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994)**; **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)**.  
24. Defendant’s delay of more than thirty days without repair violates Massachusetts *State Sanitary Code* and amounts to a constructive partial eviction. *See* **Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.**, 340 Mass. 124 (1959)** (landlord responsible for maintaining essential services).  
25. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including monetary expenditures for alternative workspace, loss of use of a portion of the Premises, and distress and inconvenience.  
26. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Find and declare that Defendant **John Thompson** has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
B. Award Plaintiff damages of **$900** or three months’ rent ($4,800), whichever is greater, pursuant to statute;  
C. Award Plaintiff compensation for consequential losses due to loss of use, including reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining alternative workspace;  
D. Award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
E. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
