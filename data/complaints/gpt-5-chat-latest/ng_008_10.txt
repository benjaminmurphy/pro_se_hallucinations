2. Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth with its principal place of business at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully upon the premises of Quincy Bistro, located at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts, as a paying customer and business invitee.  
6. During her dinner, Plaintiff observed a server drop a tray containing several glasses of water in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.  
7. The server retrieved the broken glass but left a significant amount of water and ice on the tile floor.  
8. The server stated she would “be right back with a mop” but failed to return promptly and did not place any warning cones, markers, or signs indicating a wet floor.  
9. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose from her table to use the restroom.  
10. The hallway appeared to have shiny tile flooring, and Plaintiff reasonably believed the floor was dry.  
11. As she stepped into the hallway, Plaintiff slipped on the remaining water and ice, twisting her right knee and falling to the floor.  
12. Other employees of the Defendant later remarked that they had been “dodging that puddle for a while,” indicating that the dangerous condition had been present for a substantial period and was known to Defendant’s agents and employees.  
13. Plaintiff was transported to urgent care and diagnosed with a sprained knee.  
14. Plaintiff was required to wear a brace and attend several weeks of physical therapy and follow-up treatment.  
15. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses as a result of her injury and lost approximately $2,000 in wages during her recovery.  
16. Plaintiff continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limitations in her right knee.  
17. The dangerous condition—the wet, slippery floor—was known or should have been known to Defendant and its employees, who failed to act with reasonable care to warn or remedy the condition.

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  
19. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to warn of and remedy known hazards, and to prevent foreseeable injuries. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
20. Defendant breached this duty by, inter alia:  
    a. Failing to promptly remove or clean water and ice from a commonly used hallway;  
    b. Failing to warn patrons of the slippery condition through placement of a wet floor sign or temporary barrier; and  
    c. Permitting employees to ignore or disregard a known hazard.  
21. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting losses. *See* **Jurado v. Gregory A. Robbins, M.D., P.C.**, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 773 (2018).  
22. It was reasonably foreseeable that a patron traversing the hallway would slip and fall if the wet condition was not remedied. *See* **Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Mass., Inc.**, 418 Mass. 590 (1994).  
23. Defendant’s agents, servants, and/or employees had either actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition and failed to act with reasonable care. *See* **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).  
24. Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety and did not contribute to the cause of the accident.  
25. Defendant’s negligence directly caused Plaintiff’s bodily injury, associated medical expenses, loss of earnings, and pain and suffering. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982); **Janosky v. Eastern Freight Ways, Inc.**, 390 Mass. 583 (1983); **Toubiana v. Priestly Mut. Life Ins. Co.**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988); **O'Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000); **Dubois v. Town of Brookline**, 388 Mass. 327 (1983); **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence standard).  
26. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical bills, lost income, and endured physical pain and emotional distress.

### V. DAMAGES

27. Plaintiff’s economic losses include approximately $1,500 in medical expenses and $2,000 in lost wages.  
28. Plaintiff’s non-economic losses include pain, suffering, and diminished enjoyment of life.  
29. Plaintiff seeks compensation for all such losses, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, and interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C**.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
