### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son (“Minor Child”) was attending an after-school program at the Defendant’s facility.  
6. Defendant advertised that children would be supervised at all times by trained staff while using its gymnasium.  
7. On the date in question, only one staff member remained in the gym with approximately twenty children; the other staff person left the area to complete paperwork in another part of the building.  
8. The sole supervising staff member spent a significant portion of time near the bleachers using her cellphone rather than monitoring the children.  
9. During this period, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing a rough physical tackle game on the hardwood floor.  
10. Other children informed the staff member that the rough play created unsafe conditions. The staff member responded dismissively, stating that “boys will be boys,” and failed to intervene or restore order.  
11. Shortly thereafter, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s son forcefully to the floor, causing the child to strike his head.  
12. The blow rendered Plaintiff’s son unconscious for approximately thirty seconds, after which he was transported to the emergency department and diagnosed with a concussion.  
13. As a direct result of the concussion, Plaintiff’s son suffered pain, emotional distress, and physical limitations, and Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately **$5,000** and lost wages of approximately **$1,200** due to caring for his injured child.  
14. Defendant, through its agents and employees, owed Plaintiff’s son a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising and protecting children in its custody.  
15. Defendant breached that duty by failing to adequately supervise the children, failing to maintain safe conditions, and failing to respond appropriately after being warned of dangerous behavior.  
16. Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff’s son and the damages incurred by the Plaintiff.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I – Negligence**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **Massachusetts law**, all individuals and entities owe a duty to act with reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others. (*Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983)).  
19. A duty of reasonable supervision arises where one undertakes the custody and control of children, as in school or recreational contexts. (*Barrett v. Conragan*, 302 Mass. 33 (1938); *Lyon v. Morphew*, 424 Mass. 828 (1997)).  
20. Defendant owed Plaintiff’s son a duty to take reasonable steps to supervise and protect him from foreseeable injuries while in its care. (*Mullins*, supra; *Brum v. Town of Dartmouth*, 428 Mass. 684 (1999)).  
21. Defendant breached its duty by:  
    a. Failing to maintain a proper staff-to-child supervision ratio;  
    b. Permitting staff to leave the area and neglect supervision responsibilities;  
    c. Ignoring reports of dangerous conduct; and  
    d. Failing to implement and follow reasonable safety protocols.  
22. Defendant’s breach of duty was a direct and proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff’s son and the resulting damages. (*Cameron v. Pepin*, 340 Mass. 398 (1960); *Banaghan v. Dewey*, 340 Mass. 73 (1959); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000)).  
23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under **common law** and violates the standard of care recognized in Massachusetts tort jurisprudence, including **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 282, 283, 302A**, as adopted in Massachusetts. (*Prosser v. Keeton on Torts*, cited in *Mullins*, supra).  
24. Plaintiff and his minor child sustained actual damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress compensable under **G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B–6D**. (*Conners v. Northeast Hosp. Corp.*, 439 Mass. 469 (2003); *Shantigar Found. v. Bear Mt. Builders, Inc.*, 441 Mass. 131 (2004)).  
25. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, Plaintiff was not comparatively negligent, and any negligence on the part of the Defendant was the primary and proximate cause of injury.  
26. As a direct result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered financial losses in excess of **$6,200**, as well as emotional distress and harm associated with his son’s injury.
