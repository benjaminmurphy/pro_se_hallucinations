### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Alicia Thompson**, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.  
2. The Defendant, **Mark Jensen**, is an individual residing in or owning residential rental property in Springfield, Massachusetts, and is the landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, §3** and **G.L. c. 186, §14**, as the claim arises from a breach of the landlord’s statutory and common law duties under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Housing Court of Springfield**, Western Division, as the Premises and events giving rise to this complaint are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **January 15, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant for a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, at a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
6. Beginning in approximately **mid-October 2025**, one of the two bedrooms in the Premises lost all electrical service: the ceiling fixture and all outlets in that room ceased functioning.  
7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant sent an electrician, who determined that the problem required more extensive repair work.  
8. Despite being aware of the problem, Defendant failed to restore electrical service to that room for a period exceeding six weeks.  
9. Throughout that time, Plaintiff was deprived of the ability to use one of the two bedrooms and was forced to work elsewhere, incurring daily costs for coffee shops and a coworking space membership of approximately **$15/day** and **$150/month**, respectively.  
10. Plaintiff’s living conditions were substantially diminished, and part of her apartment became unusable for normal living and work.  
11. Defendant has refused to offer rent abatement or compensation for the loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
12. As a result of Defendant’s failure to act promptly to restore electrical service, Plaintiff has suffered economic losses in an estimated amount of **$900**, and inconvenience, hardship, and disruption to her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

### IV. COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(**G.L. c. 186, §14**)

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  
14. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises” by a tenant.  
15. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy in Massachusetts. *See* **Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708, 720 (2002)**; **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715 (1977)**.  
16. The loss of electrical service to one bedroom for over six weeks constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. *See* **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994)** (landlord breach occurs upon actual or constructive interference); **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)** (tenant entitled to damages for substantial interference).  
17. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the electrical wiring, despite notice, amounted to an “act or omission” that constructively interfered with Plaintiff’s right of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Aparicio v. Mangan, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 210 (2005)**.  
18. Defendant’s conduct also violated his obligations under **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, which provides for remedies where a landlord fails to maintain premises in compliance with the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. 410.351** (requiring that all habitable rooms be provided with electrical service).  
19. Failure to maintain such essential services constitutes a violation of **the covenant of quiet enjoyment**, *see* **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997)**, **Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)**, and such interference, while not malicious, is actionable as an intentional omission once the landlord has notice.  
20. A landlord’s duty to preserve essential facilities includes a duty to make timely and effective repairs of wiring and electrical systems. *See* **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 201 (1979)**; **Hemingway v. Waterson, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 101 (2018)** (tenant entitled to rent reduction for uninhabitable portion of dwelling).  
21. The Defendant’s omission caused Plaintiff to lose use of one bedroom, to incur financial losses of approximately **$900**, and to suffer inconvenience and discomfort inconsistent with her right to quiet enjoyment.  
22. Defendant’s conduct is therefore a violation of **G.L. c. 186, §14**, entitling Plaintiff to actual and statutory damages.

### V. DAMAGES

23. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and consequential damages or, alternatively, a statutory minimum of three months’ rent, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, as applicable.  
24. Plaintiff seeks recovery of **$900** in actual damages and any additional amounts allowed by statute.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Alicia Thompson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

a. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on Count I;  
b. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of **$900**, or such other amount as may be proven at trial;  
c. Award statutory damages under **G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
d. Award Plaintiff her costs of suit and any other equitable relief as justice requires; and  
e. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
