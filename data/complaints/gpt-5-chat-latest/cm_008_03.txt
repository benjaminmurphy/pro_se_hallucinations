**LAURA MARTINEZ**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON**,  
Defendant.  

---

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION PURSUANT TO G.L. c. 208, § 28 & G.L. c. 209C, § 20**

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Martinez ("Plaintiff"), and respectfully complains and says as follows:**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is *psm1443@gmail.com*.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of **Sofia Johnson**, a minor child, born [insert DOB] (age 10 as of this filing).

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND PRIOR ORDER**

4. This Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** on **May 15, 2022**, in docket number [insert docket number], granting the parties shared legal custody of Sofia, with Plaintiff as the primary residential parent.

5. Pursuant to that Judgment, Defendant enjoys substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnights, and both parents are to cooperate regarding educational matters.

6. This Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify its prior judgment under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the general equity powers of the Probate and Family Court pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**.

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS CONSTITUTING A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. At the time of the 2022 judgment, Sofia was attending school regularly and performing well academically. Both parents were expected to support her schooling and maintain consistent attendance.

8. Beginning in approximately late 2024 and continuing throughout 2025, Defendant has repeatedly kept Sofia home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, claiming she “needs a mental health day,” yet without any physician’s note or treatment documentation.

9. On numerous occasions, Defendant has failed to ensure Sofia’s attendance at scheduled tutoring sessions that fall during his parenting weekends. These tutoring sessions were recommended by the school to address Sofia’s declining academic performance.

10. As a result of these repeated absences, Sofia’s school has issued multiple truancy warnings to the Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has been contacted by the school regarding Sofia’s falling grades and missing assignments.

11. Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to communicate with Defendant regarding Sofia’s schooling, attendance, and tutoring needs, but Defendant has refused to adjust his behavior or cooperate in promoting Sofia’s education.

12. The persistent absences on Mondays, combined with Defendant’s refusal to ensure attendance at tutoring, constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** adversely affecting the child’s welfare.

13. Because joint legal custody requires the ability of the parents to communicate and cooperate effectively on major decisions—see *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)—Defendant’s actions demonstrate a breakdown in the shared decision‑making arrangement previously ordered by this Court.

14. The current parenting schedule, including Sunday overnight visits, now impairs Sofia’s school attendance and academic progress, contrary to her best interests.

15. Modification of custody terms is therefore necessary to serve Sofia’s best interests under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and related case law.

---

### **IV. GOVERNING LAW AND AUTHORITIES**

16. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the child’s best interests.

17. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that interference with or failure to cooperate regarding a child’s education or welfare can constitute such a material change. See  
   - *Pierce v. Pierce*, 455 Mass. 286 (2009) (best interests standard governs modification of custody);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (court may modify custody where shared custody fails due to lack of cooperation);  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (child’s welfare paramount in custody matters);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (shared custody requires ability to cooperate effectively);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (court must consider all relevant changes in child’s circumstances);  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (shared custody inappropriate when communication breaks down);  
   - *Adoption of Don*, 435 Mass. 158 (2001) (educational needs and best interests are key factors);  
   - *Care and Protection of Ian*, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 615 (1999) (failure to meet child’s educational needs reflects on fitness);  
   - *M.G.L. c. 215, § 6* (equity powers to protect welfare of minors); and  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (modification justified upon substantial change affecting welfare).

18. Applying these authorities, the Defendant’s repeated disregard for Sofia’s schooling constitutes a substantial change affecting her well‑being and school progress, warranting modification.

### **V. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the May 15, 2022 custody judgment.

B. Modify the existing judgment to provide that Plaintiff shall have **sole legal custody** as to all school‑related and educational decisions, or alternatively, that Plaintiff shall have **final decision‑making authority** regarding Sofia’s education, school attendance, and tutoring participation.

C. Modify the Defendant’s parenting schedule to eliminate Sunday overnight visits or otherwise adjust the schedule so that the child is returned to Plaintiff on Sunday evenings to ensure proper school attendance on Mondays.

D. Enjoin both parties to continue to share all educational, medical, and extracurricular information, but recognizing Plaintiff’s authority when decisions are disputed.

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to serve the best interests of the minor child.
