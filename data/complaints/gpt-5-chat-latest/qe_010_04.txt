### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff began her tenancy at the Premises on or about **June 1, 2021**, pursuant to a residential lease agreement with Defendant at a monthly rent of **$1,200**.  
7. The Premises is a residential dwelling unit subject to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14** and the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.**  
8. Since approximately 2024, the **bathroom ceiling and shower area** of the Premises have been contaminated with visible **mold growth**, originating in the corner of the shower and spreading to the ceiling.  
9. The bathroom has no window and relies solely on a ceiling **exhaust fan** for ventilation.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition. Defendant inspected the Premises but **refused to take adequate remedial action**, instead blaming Plaintiff for allegedly taking “long, hot showers” and not using the fan sufficiently.  
11. Plaintiff uses the fan during showers and conditions in the bathroom are consistent with normal residential use.  
12. The continuing mold growth has caused **respiratory illness, coughing, congestion, and wheezing**, which Plaintiff’s physician attributes to mold exposure in the bathroom.  
13. Plaintiff has incurred approximately **$60** in out-of-pocket loss due to discarded towels and a shower curtain contaminated by mold.  
14. Defendant has refused to remediate the mold or improve the ventilation system, stating that the problem is “Plaintiff’s fault.”  
15. The presence of mold and Defendant’s refusal to correct the condition render the bathroom **unsanitary and unfit for habitation**, depriving Plaintiff of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
16. Defendant’s acts and omissions constitute an **interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment** in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
17. Defendant’s conduct has also breached the **implied warranty of habitability** (*Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 [1973]) and the **State Sanitary Code** (*Crowell v. McCaffrey*, 377 Mass. 443 [1979]).  
18. Plaintiff has suffered both **property loss** and **emotional distress** as a result of the continued interference and unremedied health hazard at the Premises.  
19. Plaintiff seeks damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including statutory minimum damages and costs.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

20. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 above.  
21. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
22. Defendant’s failure to remediate mold and maintain habitable conditions amounts to an unlawful interference with the plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.  
23. **Massachusetts law** recognizes that a landlord’s failure to correct unsafe or unsanitary conditions can constitute interference under this statute (*Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 [1977]; *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 [1991]*; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 [1997]*).  
24. The continuing mold condition violates the **State Sanitary Code** (105 C.M.R. 410.602, 410.500, 410.750) and thus constitutes interference with the quiet enjoyment of the premises (*McKenna v. Begin*, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 168 [1975]*; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 [1982]*).  
25. Defendant’s conduct was **willful, wanton, and knowing**, as she was repeatedly informed of the problem and refused to take appropriate corrective action.  
26. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered **disruption, discomfort, health problems, and loss of personal property**, all proximately caused by Defendant’s unlawful interference with her right to quiet enjoyment.  
27. Plaintiff is entitled to at least **three months’ rent in damages** or **actual damages**, whichever is greater, under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** (*Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 [1994]*; *Reis v. Commissioner of Div. of Unemployment Assistance*, 438 Mass. 777 [2003]*).  
28. Plaintiff also seeks **reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs**, even though she is self-represented, pursuant to the statute’s fee-shifting provision.
