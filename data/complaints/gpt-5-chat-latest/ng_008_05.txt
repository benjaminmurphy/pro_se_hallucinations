### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE)

Plaintiff **Emily Johnson**, by and for herself, brings this Complaint against Defendant **Quincy Family Restaurant** and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is 1234 Maple Street, Quincy, MA, with telephone (617) 555‑0123 and email address psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant **Quincy Family Restaurant** is a business operating a restaurant located at **123 Ocean Avenue, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169**, and is duly licensed to conduct business within the Commonwealth.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as it is a civil action seeking damages greater than $25,000 for personal injury arising in Norfolk County.

4. Venue is proper in Norfolk Superior Court pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 223, § 1**, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Quincy, Massachusetts, located in Norfolk County, and Defendant transacts business there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **August 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s restaurant, **Quincy Family Restaurant**, located at 123 Ocean Avenue, Quincy, Massachusetts.

6. While dining at the restaurant, Plaintiff arose from her table to use the restroom.

7. Shortly before that time, one of Defendant’s servers had dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining area.

8. Although the server removed most of the glass shards, she left water and ice scattered across the tiled floor, stating she would “be right back with a mop” but failed to return promptly.

9. No “wet floor” sign or any other warning was placed to alert patrons of the dangerous condition.

10. Approximately ten minutes later, the puddle remained on the floor. As Plaintiff walked toward the restroom, she stepped onto the wet tile, lost her balance, and fell, twisting her right knee violently.

11. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain and swelling in her knee and required medical attention.

12. Plaintiff was treated at an urgent care facility and was diagnosed with a severe knee sprain, requiring the use of a brace and several weeks of physical therapy.

13. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500** in medical expenses and sustained lost wages of approximately **$1,200** due to her inability to work.

14. Plaintiff also endured pain, suffering, inconvenience, and emotional distress as a result of the Defendant’s negligence.

15. Subsequent to the incident, Plaintiff overheard restaurant staff remark that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time, demonstrating that Defendant’s employees were aware, or should have been aware, of the hazardous condition but failed to remediate it or warn patrons.

---

### IV. COUNT ONE – NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff restates and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff, as an invitee lawfully on the premises, to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers that Defendant knew or should have known existed.  
   See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).

18. Defendant breached that duty by, inter alia:  
   a. Failing to timely clean and dry the floor after a spill created a slippery condition;  
   b. Failing to place any warning signs or barriers cautioning patrons;  
   c. Failing to inspect and remedy the hazardous condition within a reasonable time; and  
   d. Failing to properly train and supervise employees regarding spill cleanup and hazard notification.

19. Defendant’s employees knew or should have known that water on tile flooring in a busy passageway between the kitchen and dining room created a foreseeable risk of injury to patrons.  
   See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

20. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.  
   See *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 343, adopted in *Mounsey v. Ellard*, supra; *Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Mass., Inc.*, 418 Mass. 590 (1994).

21. Plaintiff’s injuries, including her sprained knee, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to exercise due care.  
   See *Kashian v. Worcester Gas Light Co.*, 325 Mass. 358 (1950); *Janosz v. J.C. Penney Co.*, 324 Mass. 100 (1949).

22. Defendant’s negligence constitutes a violation of Massachusetts common law governing premises liability.  
   See *Lowrey v. Cumberland Farms, Inc.*, 571 N.E.2d 572 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991); *Brennan v. Carvel Corp.*, 929 F. Supp. 929 (D. Mass. 1996).

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the damages set forth herein and continues to experience pain and limitations in her daily activities.  
   See *Mulloy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.*, 408 Mass. 450 (1990); *Griffiths v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.*, 2012 Mass. App. Div. 12 (2012).

25. Plaintiff is entitled to recover said amounts, along with reasonable costs, interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, and any other relief deemed just.
