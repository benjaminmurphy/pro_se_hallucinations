      "support_reasoning": "The opinion is about selecting an initial custodial arrangement under the best-interests standard and the statutory factors in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(a). It does not discuss a noncustodial parent later demonstrating improved parenting capacity or stability, nor does it state that such an improvement warrants expansion of parenting time. Instead, the court emphasizes preserving satisfactory existing arrangements and stability, and it affirms a custody order crafted from a comparative assessment of two currently fit parents, not from changed circumstances of a noncustodial parent.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"If the parenting arrangement in which a child has lived is satisfactory and is reasonably capable of preservation, it is ordinarily in the child\u2019s best interests to maintain that arrangement, and contrary to the child\u2019s best interest to disrupt it. Stability is itself of enormous benefit to a child, and any unnecessary tampering with the status quo simply increases the risk of harm to the child.\""
