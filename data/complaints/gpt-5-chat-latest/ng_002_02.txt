2. Defendant, **Michael Thompson**, upon information and belief, resides in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and regularly uses the public park known as Highland Park, located within the City of Newton.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 212, § 3**, as the amount in controversy is less than $50,000 and the incident occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.  

4. Venue is proper in this District under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3)** and **G.L. c. 223, § 8**, because the wrongful acts alleged occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On **May 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a paved walking path in **Highland Park** in Newton, Massachusetts.  

6. Highland Park is operated as a public recreational area accessible to residents and visitors of Newton.  

7. Posted signs throughout the park state clearly that **all dogs must be kept on a leash** at all times, pursuant to **Newton City Ordinance, Chapter 3, § 3‑12**, and **G.L. c. 140, § 173**, which authorize municipalities to regulate the restraint of dogs.  

8. At approximately 3:45 p.m., Defendant was present in Highland Park with a large dog under his ownership and control.  

9. Defendant was talking with friends roughly thirty feet away from the dog, and although he had a leash in his possession, he did not attach it to the dog.  

10. Without provocation, the dog suddenly ran at high speed toward Plaintiff, barking and growling in an aggressive manner.  

11. Fearing imminent attack or bodily harm, Plaintiff instinctively swerved off the park path to avoid the dog’s approach.  

12. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped on a protruding tree root and fell down a small embankment, suffering a **fractured wrist**.  

13. The dog came to a stop when Plaintiff fell; Defendant then called the dog back.  

14. Several bystanders witnessed the incident and identified Defendant as the dog’s owner.  

15. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment at a local hospital and incurred approximately **$4,500** in medical expenses.  

16. Plaintiff was required to wear a wrist brace for several weeks, missed employment and lost approximately **$1,200** in wages, and was unable to participate in ordinary activities including a piano recital for which she had been preparing.  

17. Defendant knew or should have known of his duty to keep the dog on a leash and under proper control and that failure to do so created an unreasonable risk of harm to others using the park.  

18. Defendant’s failure to leash and control his dog directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE

19. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  

20. Under Massachusetts law, every individual owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. *See* **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (owner of dog owes duty of reasonable care in controlling animal); **Anderson v. Dimond**, 97 Mass. App. Ct. 343 (2020).  

21. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to ensure that his dog was on a leash and under his control, consistent with **G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157**, **§ 173**, and Newton City Ordinances regulating dogs in public areas.  

22. Defendant breached that duty by negligently allowing his dog to roam free in a public park.  

23. Violation of a safety statute or ordinance designed to protect the public constitutes evidence of negligence. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990); **Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.**, 438 Mass. 317, 322 (2002).  

24. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position would foresee that an unleashed, barking, charging dog could cause nearby persons to take evasive action, risking injury even without physical contact. *See* **Kent v. Commonwealth**, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002); **Jemison v. Pfeifer**, 390 Mass. 168, 170 (1983).  

25. Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent conduct. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540, 549 (1982); **Delaney v. Reynolds**, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2005).  

26. Defendant’s actions constituted negligence as defined in **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 284**, adopted by Massachusetts courts. *See* **Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.**, 389 Mass. 47, 50–52 (1983).  

27. Plaintiff suffered actual damages, including bodily injury, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, all proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence. *See* **Poirier v. Plymouth**, 374 Mass. 206, 228 (1978).

  a. Medical expenses: approximately **$4,500**;

  c. Pain, suffering, and loss of life’s pleasures; and
