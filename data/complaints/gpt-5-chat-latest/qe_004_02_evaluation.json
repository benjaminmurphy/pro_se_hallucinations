However, Blackett involves noise and disturbance from a bar, not unsanitary conditions or infestations, and the opinion never discusses sanitation, pests, or similar conditions.

Although this is a concurring/dissenting opinion and it does not mention rodents or 105 C.M.R. 410.550/410.600 specifically, it supports the general proposition that a landlord\u2019s failure to maintain code-compliant, sanitary conditions breaches an implied habitability obligation.
