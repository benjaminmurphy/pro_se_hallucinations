---

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Main Street in Quincy, Massachusetts.  
6. While seated in the dining area, Plaintiff observed a server carrying a tray containing several water glasses.  
7. The server accidentally dropped the tray, causing water, ice, and broken glass to scatter across the tile floor in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.  
8. The server promptly picked up the broken glass but left the spilled water and ice on the floor, saying she would “be right back with a mop.”  
9. No warning sign, cone, or “wet floor” indicator was placed in the area.  
10. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff proceeded through the same hallway to access the restroom.  
11. The floor still contained pooled water and melting ice, visibly wet but resembling a shiny tile surface under the hallway lighting.  
12. As Plaintiff stepped onto the wet tile, she slipped and fell, twisting her right knee and sustaining injury.  
13. After the incident, other members of the restaurant staff were heard stating that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time.  
14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injury, specifically a **sprained knee**, requiring a knee brace and a course of physical therapy for several weeks.  
15. Plaintiff incurred **medical expenses of approximately $2,000** and **lost wages of approximately $1,500** due to missed work.  
16. Plaintiff also suffered pain, discomfort, and disruption of her ordinary daily activities as a result of the injury.

### IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff restates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Defendant, as an operator of a restaurant open to the public, owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a **duty of reasonable care** to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to inspect for hazards, and to warn invitees of any dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or should have known. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
19. Defendant breached this duty by failing to promptly clean up the liquid and ice on the floor and by failing to warn customers of the dangerous slippery condition. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); *Deagle v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263 (1961).  
20. The dangerous condition was created by Defendant’s own employee, imputing notice to Defendant. See *Gallant v. Stop & Shop*, 400 Mass. 439 (1987).  
21. Defendant’s failure to act with reasonable care constituted negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Corsetti v. Stone Co.*, 396 Mass. 1 (1985); *Cooper v. Braver*, 401 Mass. 1001 (1988).  
22. Defendant’s negligence was the **direct and proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, and lost wages. See *Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law).  
23. Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety at all times and could not have discovered the dangerous condition prior to her fall. See *Bernard v. Gallup*, 352 Mass. 327 (1967).  
24. As a foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages. See *Graci v. Massachusetts Gas Co.*, 7 Mass. App. Ct. 221 (1979).

   a. Physical pain and suffering;  
   b. Emotional distress;  
   c. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $2,000;  
   d. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,500; and  
   e. Loss of enjoyment of life and other non-economic damages.  
26. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement and amend this Complaint as further information becomes available.

A. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant **Quincy Bistro, Inc.** on all counts;
