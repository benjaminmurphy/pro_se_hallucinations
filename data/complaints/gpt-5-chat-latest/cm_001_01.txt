Defendant.

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

**Filed Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and c. 209C, § 20**

---

### **I. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Laura Johnson** (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on **March 15, 2021**, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, regarding the minor children **Emma Thompson (age 8)** and **Liam Thompson (age 6)**.  

Since the entry of that judgment, there has occurred a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor children, specifically the Defendant’s recent change in work schedule, which renders the current parenting order impracticable and contrary to the best interests of the children.  

---

### **II. PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff:** Laura Johnson, of Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
   Phone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Mark Thompson, also of Bristol County, Massachusetts, father of the minor children.  

---

### **III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of custody and visitation pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and applicable Massachusetts case law.  

4. Venue is proper in the **Bristol County Probate and Family Court** as both parties and the minor children reside within this county.

---

### **IV. PRIOR JUDGMENT**

5. On **March 15, 2021**, this Court entered a **Custody and Parenting Time Order** granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children and granting the Defendant parenting time every other weekend and one overnight per week.

6. That order was entered when both parties maintained regular daytime work schedules, allowing both to participate in consistent, hands‑on parenting.

---

### **V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. Since that judgment, the Defendant has undergone a **significant change in employment circumstances**. He now works overnight shifts from approximately **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** several nights per week, including many nights that coincide with his scheduled overnights under the current parenting plan.

8. As a result of this new employment schedule, the Defendant frequently:  
   a. Drops the children at the Plaintiff’s home with little or no notice, stating that he is too tired to care for them;  
   b. Leaves the children in the care of unrelated third parties, including a roommate whom the Plaintiff barely knows; and  
   c. Permits the children to sleep on couches or in a living room while he naps after overnight work shifts.

9. These repeated disruptions have caused instability in the children’s routines and have compromised their rest, supervision, and sense of security.  

10. The Defendant’s current work schedule and related parenting patterns were **not contemplated at the time of the original judgment** and materially affect his capacity to exercise the prior parenting time schedule.  

---

### **VI. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES**

11. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified “if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.”  

12. See also **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, establishing the same standard for modifications of custody and visitation orders concerning children born out of wedlock.  

13. The “material and substantial change” and “best interests” tests have been established and reaffirmed in **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); and **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

14. Courts must consider the stability and welfare of the child as paramount. See **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  

15. The Court may modify parenting plans upon finding that unforeseen changes render compliance impracticable or detrimental. See **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  

16. Overnight work that interferes with a parent’s ability to provide safe, direct supervision is a recognized basis for modification. See **Bluhm v. Bluhm**, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 122 (2007); **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (court must consider capacity of each parent to meet children’s day‑to‑day needs).  

17. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody matters in Massachusetts. See **Custody of Two Minors**, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31** (defining legal and physical custody and the primacy of the children’s welfare).  

18. Together, these authorities establish that when a parent’s change in working schedule interferes with the safe execution of overnight parenting time, the Court is authorized and obligated to modify the existing order to protect the children’s stability and well‑being.

### **VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:  

1. **Find** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the March 15, 2021 custody order;  

2. **Determine** that modification of parenting time is **in the best interests of the children**;  

3. **Modify** the current judgment to provide that:  
   - The Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall occur **only on nights when he is not scheduled to work** or otherwise unavailable due to fatigue from work;  
   - The Defendant shall provide **at least 48 hours’ notice** if unable to exercise scheduled parenting time;  
   - The Plaintiff shall continue to have primary physical custody, with daytime parenting time adjusted as necessary for the children’s stability and continuity; and  
   - Any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.

---

### **VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter an order modifying the existing custody and parenting schedule consistent with the children’s best interests;  
B. Grant such other and further relief as justice and equity may require.

I certify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
