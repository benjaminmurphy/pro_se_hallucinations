**EMILY JOHNSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.  

---

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Supplemental Probate Court Rule 412)

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on May 15, 2019, by the Barnstable Probate and Family Court, and for reasons therefore states as follows:**

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, resides in ________ County, Massachusetts. Her current phone number is (617) 555‑0123 and email is psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. The Defendant, **Michael Johnson**, currently resides in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, **Sophie Johnson (born [insert date of birth]), age 8**.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has **continuing jurisdiction** over matters of custody, visitation, and support pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the original judgment was entered in this Court.  

5. **Venue** is proper in this division because the prior judgment was issued here and the child resides within the Commonwealth.

---

### III. EXISTING JUDGMENT

6. On **May 15, 2019**, this Court issued a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** granting primary physical custody of Sophie Johnson to the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and providing the Defendant, Michael Johnson, with parenting time **every other weekend** and **one midweek overnight on Wednesdays**.  

7. At the time of entry, both parents resided in the same town, and the midweek overnight involved only a brief five‑minute commute to Sophie’s school the following morning.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since the entry of the May 15, 2019 Judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the child.  

9. Specifically, the Defendant, Michael Johnson, has **relocated to Cape Cod**, approximately **ninety (90) miles** away from Sophie’s primary residence and school.  

10. Despite this relocation, the Defendant insists upon exercising the same Wednesday overnight visitation, requiring Sophie to travel ninety miles late on Wednesday evenings and return home around **4:30 a.m.** Thursdays for school.  

11. As a result of this travel, Sophie frequently arrives at school exhausted and has shown noticeable academic and behavioral effects. Her teacher has reported diminished participation and attentiveness on Thursdays, substantiating that this schedule is no longer in Sophie’s best interests.  

12. The Defendant’s relocation was not contemplated by the 2019 Judgment, nor was long‑distance midweek visitation anticipated or consistent with the purposes of the original order.  

13. Continuation of the midweek overnight, given the new distance and the child’s physical and academic fatigue, constitutes a **substantial and material change** affecting Sophie’s welfare within the meaning of **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and related precedent.  

---

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody or parenting time judgment may be modified upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and where modification serves the **best interests of the child.**  

15. The controlling standards have been set forth in **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests require balancing stability against the child’s welfare following changed circumstances), and **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (modification proper where new developments adversely affect child’s welfare).  

16. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that relocation or substantial change in the parties’ living situations constitutes a material change when it affects the child’s routine, education, or stability. See, e.g., **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).  

17. The court may modify parenting time to ensure it reflects the realities of the parties’ current circumstances and protects the child’s welfare. See **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); **Pierce v. Pierce**, 455 Mass. 286 (2009); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

18. The child’s best interests are the paramount concern in all custody determinations under **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a)**. See also **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31A** (considering parental relocation and its impact).  

19. In light of the Defendant’s relocation and its direct adverse effects on the child’s rest, education, and emotional well‑being, justice requires modification of the parenting schedule. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (courts must adapt custody arrangements where a change materially affects the child’s welfare).

---

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

20. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court **remove the midweek Wednesday overnight visitation** from the current order and adjust the alternate weekend schedule to ensure regular, meaningful contact between Sophie and her father without the undue burden of long late‑night travel during the school week.

21. The Plaintiff further requests that any necessary adjustments to the weekend exchange times be made to allow continuity of relationship while safeguarding Sophie’s educational and emotional stability.

22. The Plaintiff believes these modifications are supported by the child’s teachers and consistent with the statutory and case law standards promoting the **best interests of the child**.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2019 custody order;  

B. Modify the existing judgment to eliminate the **Wednesday overnight parenting time**, and, if deemed appropriate, adjust the **alternate weekend schedule** accordingly;  

C. Grant such other relief as may be just and proper in the child’s best interests.
