## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was lawfully and properly on the premises of Defendant’s restaurant located at **123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts** as a paying customer and invitee.  

6. While dining at Defendant’s restaurant, Plaintiff walked through a narrow hallway between the kitchen and dining room.  

7. Approximately ten minutes earlier, a server employed by Defendant had dropped a tray of water glasses, spilling water and ice on the tile floor.  

8. The server picked up the broken glass but left the spilled water and ice on the floor, stating she would return with a mop.  

9. The employee failed to put down any warning sign, barricade, or other indication of the dangerous condition, in violation of Defendant’s duty to maintain the premises in reasonably safe condition.  

10. Despite knowing the floor remained wet, Defendant’s employees and management allowed patrons to continue using the hallway, without adequate warning or timely clean‑up.  

11. When Plaintiff stood up to use the restroom, the spilled water remained on the floor. The moisture was not clearly visible, and the tile floor appeared glossy but dry.  

12. Plaintiff walked into the hallway, slipped on the wet tile, and fell, twisting his right knee severely.  

13. Plaintiff immediately experienced pain and difficulty walking.  

14. Plaintiff subsequently sought medical attention at a nearby urgent‑care facility, where he was diagnosed with a **sprained knee** and prescribed a brace, rest, and physical therapy.  

15. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500.00** in medical expenses and **$1,200.00** in lost wages as a result of the injury.  

16. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain and decreased mobility in his knee.  

17. Other employees of Defendant acknowledged the presence of the puddle and indicated it had been hazardous for a period of time, evidencing Defendant’s actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition.  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, the duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of known or reasonably discoverable hazards.  

19. Defendant breached that duty by failing to timely clean the spill, to warn patrons of the slippery condition, and to take reasonable precautions to protect invitees from harm.  

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and economic damages.

## III. CAUSE OF ACTION — NEGLIGENCE  

21. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 above as if fully set forth herein.  

22. Under Massachusetts common law and **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343**, a possessor of land is liable for physical harm caused to invitees by a condition on the land if the possessor:  
   (a) knows or should know of the condition and should realize it involves an unreasonable risk of harm;  
   (b) should expect that invitees will not discover or protect themselves from the danger; and  
   (c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them.  

23. Defendant, as operator of a public restaurant, owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to keep the premises in safe condition and to warn of potential hazards. **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  

24. Defendant’s employees created a hazardous condition by leaving water and ice on a tile floor, failed to remove the hazard in a timely fashion, and failed to warn of the danger.  

25. Massachusetts law imposes liability where a defendant had actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition and failed to act reasonably. **Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); **Deagle v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263 (1961).  

26. Defendant’s breach of duty constitutes negligence under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which requires the trier of fact to apportion fault but does not eliminate liability for negligent acts.  

27. The duty of care extends to the prevention of foreseeable slip‑and‑fall injuries resulting from unsafe floor conditions. **Boehm v. Foxhill School, Inc.**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 624 (1988); **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).  

28. Defendant failed to establish reasonable inspection and maintenance procedures, contrary to principles articulated in **Brown v. Wong**, 434 Mass. 708 (2001) and **Cragie v. Voe**, 509 F. Supp. 2d 216 (D. Mass. 2007)**.**

29. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence because it fell below the standard of ordinary care that a reasonably prudent restaurant operator would exercise under like circumstances. **Dos Santos v. Carlo’s Trucking, Inc.**, 468 Mass. 171 (2014).  

30. The injury to Plaintiff was foreseeable and was the natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s neglect. **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37 (2009).  

31. Defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, entitling Plaintiff to damages for his medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering. **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431**; **Kane v. Fields Corner Grille, Inc.**, 341 Mass. 640 (1961).  

32. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained:  
   a. bodily injury and pain;  
   b. medical expenses of approximately $2,500;  
   c. lost wages of approximately $1,200;  
   d. loss of enjoyment of normal activities; and  
   e. emotional distress associated with injury and recovery.  

---

## IV. DAMAGES

33. Plaintiff seeks all compensatory damages permitted by law, including but not limited to reimbursement of medical costs, lost earnings, and fair compensation for physical and emotional suffering.  

34. Plaintiff also seeks statutory interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, and costs.  

---

## V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, **Michael Johnson**, respectfully requests that the Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant **Quincy Bistro**;  
B. Award compensatory damages in an amount determined by the jury sufficient to compensate Plaintiff fully, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
C. Award statutory interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B** and costs under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(d)**; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

## VI. JURY DEMAND  

Pursuant to **Mass. R. Civ. P. 38**, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

**Michael Johnson**, Plaintiff  
By his own signature, acting pro se:
