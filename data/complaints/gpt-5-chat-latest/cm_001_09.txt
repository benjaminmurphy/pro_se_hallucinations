Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7)

---

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, *Jessica Collins*, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order previously entered by this Honorable Court on **June 15, 2020**, stating as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1.  Plaintiff, **Jessica Collins**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children **Ethan Smith (born 2017)** and **Emma Smith (born 2019)**.

2.  Defendant, **Michael Smith**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children.

3.  This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time matters pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**.

---

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4.  On or about **June 15, 2020**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** granting the parties joint legal custody of the minor children, with physical custody primarily with the Plaintiff and parenting time to the Defendant every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

5.  At the time the Judgment was entered, both parties worked daytime schedules, and the parenting plan was agreed upon as being in the children’s best interests under those then-existing circumstances.

---

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6.  Since entry of the June 15, 2020 Judgment, a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred.

7.  The Defendant recently accepted new employment requiring **overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. several nights per week**, including many of the Defendant’s scheduled overnight parenting times.

8.  As a result of his work schedule, the Defendant has repeatedly been unable to exercise his scheduled overnight parenting time consistently.

9.  The Defendant has, on multiple occasions, **dropped off the minor children at the Plaintiff’s residence with little or no notice**, citing exhaustion from his work shift.

10.  On other occasions, the Defendant has **left the children in the care of an unrelated roommate**, whom the Plaintiff does not know and who has no established relationship with the children.

11.  The children have reported **sleeping on the couch** at the Defendant’s residence while he naps after returning from overnight work.

12.  These conditions **did not exist at the time of the original Judgment**, and they significantly impair the children’s stability, rest, and parental supervision.

13.  Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a court may modify a custody or visitation order upon a showing that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and that modification is necessary in the child’s best interests.  
    *See* **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

---

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

14.  Massachusetts law holds that the child’s welfare and best interests are the “touchstone” of all custody determinations. *See* **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).

15.  A substantial and continuing change in a parent’s ability to exercise custody or parenting time may justify modification. *See* **Rosen v. Rosen**, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2017); **Todd v. Todd**, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 895 (1990).

16.  When one parent’s schedule prevents consistent care or results in custodial instability, modification may be appropriate to promote the children’s welfare. *See* **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

17.  Courts recognize that changes in employment or living conditions may constitute material changes in circumstances warranting modification if they directly affect the children’s welfare. *See* **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); **Champagne v. Champagne**, 429 Mass. 324 (1999).

18.  The overarching standard is always the “best interests of the child,” and the Court has broad equitable authority to modify existing custody arrangements accordingly. *See* **Bluhm v. Bluhm**, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 803 (2007); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19.  Pursuant to **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7(b)** and relevant practice under **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, this Complaint is properly brought before the Probate and Family Court to modify the prior custody adjudication.

### V. RELIEF REQUESTED

20.  In light of the foregoing, the Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since entry of the June 15, 2020 order, and that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor children.

21.  The Plaintiff specifically requests that the Court:

   a. Modify the existing parenting schedule to provide that the Defendant shall have **overnight parenting time only on nights when he is not scheduled to work**, and shall notify the Plaintiff of his work schedule at least two weeks in advance;

   b. Provide for **consistent daytime parenting time** or make-up time where feasible, to preserve the children’s relationship with both parents;

   c. Incorporate such additional terms as the Court deems necessary to ensure stability, predictability, and the children’s safety and well-being;

   d. Grant such other and further relief as is just and proper.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Determine that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the June 15, 2020 custody order;  
2. Modify said order accordingly to restrict overnight parenting time to nights when the Defendant is off work;  
3. Grant any additional relief this Court deems equitable and in the best interests of the minor children.
