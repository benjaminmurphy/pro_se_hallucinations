      "support_reasoning": "The opinion explicitly addresses the trial judge\u2019s authority to limit a noncustodial parent\u2019s visitation and affirms a reduction in the father\u2019s visitation time based on the children\u2019s best interests and concerns about their welfare (including reference to \u201cincidents inconsistent with the best interests of the children\u201d). The court expressly recognizes that promoting the child\u2019s best interests may require limiting a parent\u2019s liberties, thereby supporting the proposition that a court may order visitation limitations to ensure a child\u2019s safety and welfare.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cFrom our above discussion of the record, it should be readily apparent that in view of the circumstances and the personalities involved the judge was justified in reducing the husband\u2019s visitation to less than it previously had been under the temporary custody order. \u2026 \u2018[T]he \u2018best interests\u2019 of the child[ren] are to be promoted, and when the parents are at odds [as here], the attainment of that purpose may involve some limitation of the liberties of one or other of the parents.\u2019 \u2026 We do not think it would serve any useful purpose to recount portions of the evidence from which the judge could reasonably have determined that incidents inconsistent with the best interests of the children \u2026 occurred during certain extended periods when the husband was exercising his visitation rights\u2026.\u201d}"
