The court explains that setting up and maintaining the trampoline immediately adjacent to the shallow pool, knowing people would jump from one to the other, could constitute a breach of that duty and should have been submitted to the jury under a proper instruction.

It does not hold that any breach by Kask was the direct and proximate cause of Officer Jupin\u2019s injuries; instead, it remands for a jury to determine breach and causation.
