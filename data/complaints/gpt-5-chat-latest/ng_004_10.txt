### **COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jordan Smith (“Plaintiff”)**, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and may be contacted at (617) 555‑0123 or via email at psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. Upon information and belief, the Defendant, **Linda Johnson (“Defendant”)**, is an individual who owns and manages a three‑unit residential property located at **45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts**.  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this negligence action pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, because the amount in controversy is less than $50,000 and the events giving rise to this action occurred within Worcester County.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts.

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **February 15, 2023**, the Plaintiff was lawfully upon the premises located at **45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts**, delivering groceries to a resident of the property.  
6. The Defendant, as owner and landlord of said property, retained control over and was responsible for maintaining the adjacent sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and invitees.  
7. Following a snowstorm earlier that month, Defendant shoveled only a narrow pathway along the center of the sidewalk but failed to apply salt, sand, or any other de‑icing material.  
8. Over the ensuing days, melting snow and refreezing temperatures caused the narrow shoveled path to become **a sheet of ice**, creating a hazardous and unreasonable risk to pedestrians.  
9. Multiple residents of the property texted and sent photographs to Defendant warning her about the dangerously icy condition; Defendant responded that “the sun will take care of it,” and took no remedial action.  
10. On February 15, 2023, while performing his delivery duties, Plaintiff walked on that same path, slipped on the ice, and fell backward, **striking his lower back** on the sidewalk.  
11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained painful and disabling injuries to his lower back, requiring medical treatment, physical therapy, and resulting in lost wages.  
12. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500 in medical expenses** and **$1,000 in lost income** from missed work.  
13. Plaintiff has also suffered ongoing pain, discomfort, and diminished quality of life as a result of his injuries.

### **IV. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a **duty of reasonable care** to maintain the premises, including the sidewalk under her control, in a condition reasonably safe for lawful visitors and foreseeable users. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
16. Defendant also had a duty, pursuant to **G.L. c. 84, § 15**, to exercise due care in maintaining a public way adjacent to property under her control so as not to create or permit unsafe conditions caused by snow and ice.  
17. Defendant breached this duty by failing to properly de‑ice or treat the walkway, ignoring known hazards, and failing to act after being notified by tenants of the dangerous ice accumulation.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner must act as a reasonable person under all circumstances to prevent injury from foreseeable risks. See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); **Sullivan v. Brookline**, 416 Mass. 825 (1994); **Jasko v. Waltham**, 398 Mass. 230 (1986).  
19. The Defendant’s failure to remove or treat the ice constitutes a breach of duty recognized under **Massachusetts common law of premises liability**, including but not limited to **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013), which holds that liability arises when a property owner fails to act reasonably in light of foreseeable harm.  
20. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries were the **direct and proximate result** of Defendant’s breach of duty. See **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343** (1965), adopted in **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000).  
21. Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises and did not assume the risk of the icy condition or act with contributory negligence. See **Mass. G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence standard).  
22. Because Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries, she is liable at common law. See **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401 (1991); **Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.**, 400 Mass. 837 (1987).  
23. Plaintiff has suffered **economic damages** (medical costs and lost wages) and **non‑economic damages** (pain and suffering, emotional distress) directly resulting from Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.
