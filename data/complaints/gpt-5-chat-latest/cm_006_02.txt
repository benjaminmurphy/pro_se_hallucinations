## **JURISDICTION**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, as the original custody judgment was entered in this Court and the minor children reside within its jurisdiction.  

---

## **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. The Judgment of Custody, Support, and Parenting Time issued on **May 15, 2020**, granted Plaintiff **primary physical custody** of the minor children and granted the Defendant parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.  

5. At the time of the judgment, neither party was involved in a serious domestic partnership or cohabiting relationship; accordingly, the judgment contained no provisions concerning the presence of non-parental adults during the Defendant’s parenting time.  

6. Since entry of the judgment, the Defendant has entered into a cohabiting relationship with an individual who, upon information and belief, has a **criminal record for assault and battery** and has been subject to a **209A Abuse Prevention Order** issued against him by a previous intimate partner.  

7. The minor children, Emily and Noah, have both reported observed instances of **yelling, door-slamming, and intimidating behavior** in the Defendant’s household attributable to this individual.  

8. On at least one occasion, Emily reported that the individual **grabbed her arm hard enough to leave a visible mark**, which the Plaintiff personally observed.  

9. On another occasion, a neighbor reportedly **called the police during a loud domestic argument** between the Defendant’s partner and others present while the minor children were in the home.  

10. These events constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the children’s welfare, creating an environment inconsistent with their safety, stability, and emotional well-being.

11. As a result of these developments, the continued unsupervised visitation of the Defendant in the presence of said individual poses a **present and significant risk** to the physical and emotional safety of the minor children.

12. The Plaintiff has attempted to address these concerns informally with the Defendant, requesting that the individual not be present during parenting time; however, the Defendant has refused to accommodate this request.

13. The children’s best interests require modification of the existing custody order to ensure that (a) the Defendant’s parenting time be **supervised** or, alternatively, (b) the court issue an order that the Defendant’s partner **not be present during the minor children’s visits**.

---

## **LEGAL STANDARD**

14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting plan judgment upon a finding that (a) a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred, and (b) the proposed modification is in the **best interests of the child**. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006).

15. The “material change” requirement ensures stability but allows flexibility when circumstances affecting the child’s welfare evolve. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981).

16. The overarching inquiry remains the welfare and best interests of the child. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

17. In determining whether modification is necessary, courts consider the child’s safety and the ability of each parent to provide a stable and secure environment. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

18. When evidence arises of violence or unsafe domestic conditions, Massachusetts courts must act to protect children from potential harm. See **G.L. c. 208, § 31A** (requiring consideration of domestic violence); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 596 (1996); *Adoption of Quentin*, 424 Mass. 882, 886 (1997).

19. The Court’s paramount consideration is always the child’s best interests, even over parental preferences. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).

20. The requirement that modifications be “material” ensures that the court does not reopen judgments lightly but responds appropriately to serious changes in circumstances. *Roe v. Roe*, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 382 (2008).

21. The presence of a cohabitant with a history of violence constitutes a material change in circumstances justifying review of custody or parenting time. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262 (2001); see also **G.L. c. 209A** (domestic violence protection statute).

## **RELIEF REQUESTED**

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2020 judgment, due to the Defendant’s cohabitation with an individual who presents safety concerns for the minor children;  

B. Modify the existing custody and parenting time order to provide that:  
   1. The Defendant’s parenting time shall be **supervised** by an appropriate third party or supervised visitation center; **or, in the alternative,**  
   2. The Defendant shall ensure that his cohabiting partner **is not present during any visitation with the minor children**;  

C. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the safety and well-being of the minor children; and  

D. Schedule a hearing on this Complaint for Modification at the earliest practicable date.
