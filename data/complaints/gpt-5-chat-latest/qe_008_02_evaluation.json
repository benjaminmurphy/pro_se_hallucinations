      "support_reasoning": "The court holds that the landlord\u2019s prolonged failure to correct serious sanitary code violations (ventilation and infestation) constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment because the landlord\u2019s omissions impaired the value and character of the premises. While the facts include an actual fire (not mere fear), the court\u2019s reasoning directly recognizes liability based on the landlord\u2019s failure to correct conditions that seriously interfered with the tenants\u2019 tenancy and substantially impaired their use of the unit. Thus, the case supports the principle that liability arises when unremedied conditions significantly impair use/enjoyment of the premises.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe implied covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees tenants the right to be free from \u2018serious\u2019 interferences with their tenancies. \u2026 A landlord violates G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, when its \u2018acts or omissions impair the value of the leased premises.\u2019 \u2026 Here, the judge found that the landlord knowingly rented the premises in a defective condition and failed to correct the ventilation problem\u2026for over nine years. \u2026 On these facts\u2026we think that the judge was required to find a serious interference with the tenancy and substantial impairment of the character and value of the leased premises.\u201d"

Thus the case does not support the specific public\u2011policy proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cCruz Management had notice of numerous sanitary, building and fire code violations in the apartment leased by Thomas. It was wholly foreseeable (in fact, it was inevitable) that the failure adequately to correct these violations, which included inadequate heat and hot water and a serious infestation of vermin, would impair substantially the value of the leased premises as a dwelling place for Thomas and her family. On the facts found by the judge a violation of \u00a7 14 has been shown.\u201d"

However, the court does not discuss or frame the landlord\u2019s obligations in terms of a broad public policy requiring landlords to provide \u2018secure housing\u2019 as such. Its focus is on statutory and common-law duties regarding habitability and harassment, not an articulated public policy of secure housing, so it does not clearly support the specific proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAfter his view, the judge made express findings. Among other defects, the judge found that: (1) there was no functioning heating system; \u2026 (8) the apartment was infested with cockroaches and rodents\u2026. On the emotional distress counterclaim, the judge determined that Gonzalez had proved that Haddad's intentional and outrageous conduct had caused her to suffer severe emotional distress\u2026 We conclude that, in appropriate circumstances, tenants may recover multiple damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress under c. 93A.\u201d"
