v.                                                    Civil Action No. __________  

**CAFÉ DELIGHT,**

**COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE**  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
**INTRODUCTION**

This is a civil action for personal injuries arising from Defendant Café Delight’s negligence in maintaining its restaurant premises at 123 Ocean Avenue, Quincy, Massachusetts. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the floor of its premises in a safe condition and to warn patrons of a known hazard, Plaintiff Emily Johnson suffered serious personal injuries, lost wages, and other damages.

---------------------------------------------------------------  
**PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She may be reached for purposes of this litigation at phone number (617) 555‑0123 and email address psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant **Café Delight** (“Defendant”) is a business entity operating a restaurant located at 123 Ocean Avenue, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169, within Norfolk County.

---------------------------------------------------------------  
**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 and arises from an incident occurring within Norfolk County.

4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the Defendant transacts business and the incident giving rise to this claim occurred in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

---------------------------------------------------------------  
**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **August 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was a lawful patron at Defendant’s restaurant, Café Delight, located at 123 Ocean Avenue, Quincy, Massachusetts.

6. While Plaintiff was dining, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and dining room.

7. The server cleaned up the visible broken glass but left a puddle of water and ice on the tile floor, intending to return later to mop.

8. The server failed to post any warning sign or barrier to alert patrons to the wet and slippery condition.

9. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff rose from her table to use the restroom and walked into the same hallway, unaware of the hazardous condition.

10. The wet floor was visibly shiny, and Plaintiff reasonably believed the reflection was merely the pattern of the tile until she stepped onto it and slipped.

11. Plaintiff fell and twisted her right knee, suffering immediate pain and swelling.

12. Other restaurant staff were overheard stating that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, confirming that Defendant’s employees knew of the dangerous condition but failed to remedy it or adequately warn patrons.

13. Plaintiff sought treatment at urgent care and was diagnosed with a knee sprain requiring a brace and several weeks of physical therapy.

14. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$2,500 in medical expenses** and **$1,200 in lost wages** due to time missed from work.

15. Defendant and its employees owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn her of hazards of which it knew or should have known.

16. Defendant breached that duty by:  
   (a) failing to promptly remove the water and ice from the floor;  
   (b) failing to place any warning signs or barriers; and  
   (c) allowing a hazard to persist for a significant period despite actual knowledge thereof.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, pain and suffering, lost wages, and incurred medical expenses.

---------------------------------------------------------------  
**COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

18. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.

19. Under Massachusetts law, an owner or occupier of land owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).

20. That duty includes the obligation to maintain the premises in a condition that is reasonably safe and to warn of latent or hidden dangers. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Davis v. West Roxbury Co-op Bank*, 318 Mass. 1 (1945).

21. A proprietor of a restaurant must take reasonable care to protect patrons from hazards which the proprietor knows or should know about. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermkts., Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

22. Defendant had actual knowledge of the wet and slippery floor created by its employee and failed to act reasonably to eliminate the danger or provide warning. Such conduct constitutes a breach of duty under Massachusetts law. *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263 (1961).

23. Massachusetts General Laws c. 231, § 85 establishes that comparative negligence applies only to reduce recovery if the plaintiff’s negligence is greater than the defendant’s; in this case, Plaintiff acted reasonably and was without fault.

24. Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, physical pain, lost wages, and medical expenses. *Colangeli v. Construction Serv. Co.*, 353 Mass. 527 (1968); *Horseman v. Berman’s Motor Express, Inc.*, 343 Mass. 433 (1961).

25. Plaintiff has suffered general damages including pain, suffering, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life. *Ferriter v. Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, Inc.*, 381 Mass. 507 (1980); *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986).

26. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing these injuries, and Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages. *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540 (1982); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983).

---------------------------------------------------------------

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Café Delight on the claim of negligence;

C. Award costs and allowable interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---------------------------------------------------------------
