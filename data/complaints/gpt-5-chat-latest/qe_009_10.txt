### COMPLAINT  
*(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)*

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Hartman** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01105.  
2. Defendant **Thomas Jenkins** (“Defendant”) is an individual doing business and owning rental property in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01105 (the “Premises”).  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 185C, §3**, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under **G.L. c. 223, §1**, because the Premises at issue are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about **May 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant to rent a two‑bedroom residential apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105, at a rent of **$1,600 per month**.  
6. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Premises, complied with all material terms of the tenancy, and paid rent in a timely manner.  
7. Approximately **six weeks prior to December 1, 2025**, the electrical wiring serving one of the two bedrooms in the Premises failed. All outlets and the overhead light fixture in that room stopped functioning.  
8. Defendant was promptly notified by Plaintiff of this condition. Defendant later sent an electrician who confirmed that the issue required substantial repairs due to the building’s outdated wiring.  
9. Despite the electrician’s findings, **Defendant failed to complete necessary repairs within a reasonable time**, and as of the filing of this Complaint, the room remains without electrical service.  
10. As a result, Plaintiff has been deprived of the use of that bedroom, which had served as her home office.  
11. Plaintiff has been forced to work from public spaces such as cafés, incurring daily expenses of approximately **$15 per day**, and also to purchase a coworking membership costing **$150 per month**, to continue her employment.  
12. Plaintiff’s living conditions have been substantially impaired, as office equipment and furniture are now stored in her limited remaining living space.  
13. The lack of electricity in one bedroom has rendered a significant portion of the Premises uninhabitable and has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.  
14. Defendant’s failure to maintain safe and habitable conditions constitutes **an interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises**, contrary to Massachusetts statutory and common law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 14 above.  
16. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”  
17. Defendant’s failure to remedy the electrical disrepair, despite actual or constructive notice, constituted a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s peaceful and beneficial use of the Premises.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment does not require an intentional act but may arise from a landlord’s negligence or inaction, as recognized in ***Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)**.  
19. Defendant’s conduct violated Plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, and constitutes a breach of the implied covenant recognized in ***Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997)** (landlord’s failure to maintain property may amount to breach of quiet enjoyment).  
20. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that failure to maintain essential services or utilities amounts to an actionable interference with quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:  
   - ***Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)*;  
   - ***Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994)*;  
   - ***Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994)*;  
   - ***Winchester v. Miss. Valley Gas Co.*, 321 Mass. 253 (1947)*;  
   - ***Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 326 Mass. 393 (1950)*;  
   - ***Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)*;  
   - ***Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985)*;  
   - ***Sargent v. Tenaska, Inc.*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 858 (1989)*;  
   - ***Anderson v. Beta Realty Corp.*, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 386 (1991)*.  
21. Defendant’s inaction also violated Massachusetts’ habitability and safety obligations under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, and the **State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000**, which collectively require landlords to maintain essential utilities including electricity in all habitable rooms.  
22. Under *Simon v. Solomon*, supra, interference with quiet enjoyment is established where a landlord’s conduct or failure to act creates conditions “so serious as to materially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.”  
23. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including loss of use of one bedroom, inconvenience, and associated out‑of‑pocket expenses totaling approximately **$450**, as well as emotional distress and disruption of daily living.  
24. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, Defendant is liable for **actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

C. Award any additional relief that this Court deems just and proper to remedy the interference with Plaintiff’s peaceful and habitable use of her home; and  
D. Grant statutory attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**.
