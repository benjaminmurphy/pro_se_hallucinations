v.

Defendant.  

Civil Action No. _______

### **COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

---

**Plaintiff, Jordan Harris (“Plaintiff”),** brings this complaint against **Defendant, Linda Smith (“Defendant”)**, and alleges as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jordan Harris (“Harris”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  
2. Defendant Linda Smith (“Smith”) is an individual who owns and manages the property located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).  
3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted as Harris’s landlord within the meaning of the Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3** (Housing Court jurisdiction over landlord-tenant matters) and **G.L. c. 231, § 1** (civil actions for money damages and equitable relief).  
5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court Department because the Premises is located in Roxbury, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to rent the basement apartment at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,200.  
7. Plaintiff has resided continuously in the Premises since that date.  
8. In or around November 2024, Plaintiff observed water seeping through the basement wall during heavy rainfall.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message that the Premises was taking on water. Defendant responded that she would “look into it.”  
10. Several weeks passed without any remedial work being undertaken by Defendant. The water intrusion persisted during subsequent rains, damaging Plaintiff’s property, including a rug and a bookshelf valued collectively at approximately $400.  
11. The ongoing dampness required Plaintiff to operate a dehumidifier continuously, increasing Plaintiff’s electrical costs.  
12. After Defendant failed to make timely repairs, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston’s Inspectional Services Department, which inspected the Premises and identified violations of the Massachusetts Sanitary Code (**105 CMR 410.000 et seq.**) relating to the water infiltration and other issues.  
13. The continued water intrusion, moisture, and property damage have rendered the unit partially uninhabitable and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
14. Defendant has failed to correct the condition despite notice and reasonable opportunity to do so.  
15. Defendant has now stated she does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026, allegedly due to a prior late rent payment; however, the timing of her statements strongly suggests retaliatory motive related to Plaintiff’s report of code violations.  
16. Plaintiff has suffered damages, including property loss of approximately $400, loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, increased electrical costs, and emotional distress due to the persistent uncorrected conditions and the threat of nonrenewal.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

17. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.”  
19. Defendant’s failure to repair substantial water infiltration after notice, resulting in continued dampness and property damage, constitutes a “substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment” in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
20. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that persistent water leaks, unhealthy living conditions, and failure to remedy code violations constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (unremedied code violations and water leaks supported damages for breach of quiet enjoyment); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (substantial interference caused by landlord’s acts or omissions violates covenant); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (failure to address persistent flooding and leaks supports recovery under G.L. c. 186, § 14).  
21. Defendant’s failure to act after receiving both Plaintiff’s notice and official notice from city inspectors shows a reckless disregard of the tenant’s right to habitable and peaceful occupancy.  
22. Defendant’s conduct further violated **G.L. c. 239, § 2A** and **G.L. c. 186, § 18**, which protect tenants from retaliatory conduct following reports to governmental authorities.  
23. Additional authority supports Plaintiff’s claim, including *Dorgan v. Loukas*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959 (1985) (finding breach of quiet enjoyment for repeated flooding); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Carter v. Seto*, 2002 Mass. App. Div. 23 (2002); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (establishing implied warranty of habitability closely related to quiet enjoyment).  
24. Defendant’s omissions breached Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment by making the premises unfit, unsafe, and unreasonably uncomfortable for ordinary living.  
25. As a result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to property loss, increased utility costs, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment, all proximately caused by Defendant’s violation of law.  
26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover his actual and consequential damages or one month’s rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

### **V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment for Plaintiff on the claim for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Award Plaintiff his actual damages in the amount of **$400** or one month’s rent (**$1,200**), whichever is greater, as provided by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
C. Award Plaintiff his court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as mandated by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

### **VI. JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
