### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

**INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff Julia Thompson (“Plaintiff”), by and for her complaint against Defendant Bargain Home Goods, Inc. (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Julia Thompson** is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Her phone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.  
2. Defendant **Bargain Home Goods, Inc.** (“Bargain Home Goods”) is, upon information and belief, a domestic or foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, operating a retail store located at **123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852**.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has **subject‑matter jurisdiction** under **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, because the matter in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interests and costs.  
4. Venue is proper in **Middlesex County** pursuant to **G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2**, because the cause of action occurred in Lowell, Middlesex County, and the Defendant transacts business there.  
5. Defendant’s actions and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred within the Commonwealth and caused injury to the Plaintiff within Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **July 15, 2023**, Plaintiff lawfully entered Defendant’s store located at **123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts**, to inspect and possibly purchase kitchen goods.  
7. Defendant maintained stacks of heavy boxed appliances—including toaster ovens—on high retail shelving approximately five to six boxes high, without safety restraints, rails, or barriers.  
8. Another customer, while reasonably navigating the aisle with a shopping cart, lightly bumped a lower shelf.  
9. In response, a **toaster‑oven box** fell from the upper shelving and struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and the side of her head.  
10. Plaintiff immediately became dizzy and experienced pain and a headache.  
11. Store management witnessed the incident, prepared an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon rather than prompt medical assistance.  
12. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, and she sought treatment at a local emergency department in Lowell.  
13. Physicians diagnosed Plaintiff with a **mild concussion** and **shoulder strain**.  
14. Plaintiff followed medical advice, incurred approximately **$1,800** in medical expenses, and missed about **$600** in wages from her employment as a delivery driver.  
15. Plaintiff also could not participate in her regular soccer league for approximately one month.  
16. The incident was a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence in maintaining the premises in a dangerous condition.  
17. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as an invitee, to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition.  
18. Defendant breached that duty—by stacking heavy boxes precariously and failing to secure them—thereby creating an unreasonable risk of falling merchandise.  
19. Defendant knew or should have known that merchandise could dislodge if shelves were bumped.  
20. As a proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, medical expenses, and loss of wages.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF – NEGLIGENCE

21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as though fully set forth herein.  
22. Under **Massachusetts tort law**, a business owner owes a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect invitees from foreseeable risks. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  
23. Defendant’s conduct violated the standard of ordinary care required by law (*see* **Bordenville v. City of Cambridge**, 388 Mass. 993 (1983); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010)**).  
24. It is settled law in Massachusetts that a property owner is liable for injuries caused by unsafe conditions of which it knew or reasonably should have known. *See* **Batchelder v. Realty Expo, Inc.**, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 1124 (2016) (Rule 1:28 decision reaffirming duty to discover and remedy hazards).  
25. Defendant’s failure to secure merchandise and maintain safe shelving constituted negligence as defined in **G.L. c. 231, § 85** and **Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343–343A** (adopted in *Poole v. Lynn Shopping Ctr. Inc.*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 494 (2010)).  
26. *See also* **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973) (reasonable care under circumstances); **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) (foreseeability central to negligence).  
27. The cause of Plaintiff’s injuries was foreseeable given that merchandise in a high‑traffic aisle was stacked precariously without restraints (*see* **Rosiello v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.**, 293 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D. Mass. 2003)**).  
28. Defendant failed to conduct reasonable inspections and failed to correct the unsafe condition, violating its duty under *see* **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007)**.  
29. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s concussion, shoulder injury, medical expenses, and loss of wages (*see* **Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth.**, 905 F. Supp. 2d 97 (D. Mass. 2012)**).  
30. Plaintiff did not contribute to her injuries through any negligence or fault of her own, within the meaning of **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence).  
31. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain pain, suffering, emotional distress, and diminished quality of life.

   b. Lost wages of approximately **$600**;
