Plaintiff,  

v.

Defendant.

### COMPLAINT  
(For Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. **Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell** (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 25 Union Square, Apt. 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.  
2. **Defendant, Samuel Thompson** (“Defendant”) is an individual residing or doing business in Massachusetts as the owner and landlord of the premises located at 25 Union Square, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.  
3. Plaintiff rents a second-floor apartment at this address under a written lease that began on or about January 1, 2022, for a monthly rent of $1,800.  
4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19**, as the premises are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Somerville District Court and the claim arises there.  
5. This action seeks damages not exceeding the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court, as permitted by **G.L. c. 212, § 3** and **G.L. c. 231, § 1**.  

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. The lease between Plaintiff and Defendant contains, either expressly or by operation of law, a covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteeing Plaintiff’s undisturbed possession and use of the premises.  
7. Since approximately June 2025, occupants of the third-floor apartment—also tenants of Defendant—have engaged in persistent and excessive noise, including stomping, loud music, and moving furniture during late and early hours.  
8. Plaintiff made repeated complaints to Defendant regarding the noise on at least five or six occasions.  
9. Defendant spoke to the offending tenants once but took no further meaningful action and stated to Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”  
10. The disturbances have continued unabated, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and enjoy the premises.  
11. As a result of sleep deprivation, Plaintiff received a written reprimand at work for falling asleep at the desk, incurred medical expenses, began prescription sleep medication costing approximately $40 per month, and purchased noise mitigation devices with no success.  
12. The excessive noise and Defendant’s failure to act constitute a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.  
13. Plaintiff has thereby been deprived of the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the rented premises from approximately June 2025 to the present.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered hardship, physical discomfort, emotional distress, and financial losses estimated at $1,200 or more.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–14 as though fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly, by any means whatsoever, interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.”  
17. The statutory covenant is also implied in every lease and tenancy at will under Massachusetts common law. See  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91 (1982)** (recognizing breach of quiet enjoyment where landlord failed to correct known nuisance);  
   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714 (1977)** (landlord responsible for noise from other tenants when failure to control constitutes interference);  
   - *Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.*, **437 Mass. 708 (2002)** (quiet enjoyment breached when landlord’s conduct substantially interferes with tenant’s use);  
   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, **424 Mass. 847 (1997)**;  
   - *Winchester v. O’Brien*, **266 Mass. 33 (1929)**;  
   - *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273 (1994)**;  
   - *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, **417 Mass. 782 (1994)** (tenant entitled to relief under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for failures to prevent disturbances);  
   - *Kacin v. Town of Medford Hous. Auth.*, **67 Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (2006)** (Rule 1:28 decision recognizing landlord duty to abate interference);  
   - *Rugen v. Ward*, **57 Mass. App. Ct. 1105 (2003)**;  
   - *Cummings Props., LLC v. National Commun. Corp.*, **449 Mass. 490 (2007)** (defining substantial interference).  
18. Defendant, despite notice of the detrimental noise conditions, failed to take reasonable steps to abate them.  
19. Defendant’s omissions and statements constituted interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment both “directly and indirectly” within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
20. Such interference was substantial, unreasonable, continuous, and proximately caused the injuries described above.  
21. Defendant’s conduct was willful, wanton, or at minimum reckless, warranting statutory damages.  
22. As a result, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and/or statutory damages as provided by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, including, where appropriate, treble damages and attorney’s fees (should they later be incurred).

### IV. DAMAGES

23. Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses estimated at $1,200, along with non-economic harm including distress, inconvenience, and loss of sleep.  
24. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to either actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and any reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable.  
25. Plaintiff therefore seeks damages in the statutory amount of at least $5,400 (three months’ rent at $1,800), or, alternatively, actual damages of $1,200, whichever is greater, plus costs.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

B. Award Plaintiff the greater of three months’ rent ($5,400) or actual damages in the amount of $1,200;  
C. Award costs of suit and any further relief the Court deems just and proper; and  
D. Grant such other and further relief as justice may require.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
