---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about March 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s minor son, J.J., was enrolled in the after-school program at the Brockton Community Center, located at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, Massachusetts.  

6. Defendant represented to parents, including Plaintiff, that children in the program would be continuously supervised by qualified staff during all activities, including gym time.  

7. On the date in question, approximately twenty children were present in the gymnasium under the supposed supervision of two staff members.  

8. However, one staff member left to complete paperwork in the office, leaving only one employee to monitor the group.  

9. The remaining staff member spent a substantial amount of time looking at her mobile phone while seated near the gym bleachers instead of actively supervising the children.  

10. During this period, two older boys—approximately twelve years old—began engaging in rough, tackle-style physical play on the hardwood floor.  

11. Several children reported this unsafe behavior to the staff member, who dismissed their concerns stating, “boys will be boys.”  

12. Shortly thereafter, one of the older boys tackled J.J., age eight, causing him to strike his head violently on the gym floor.  

13. J.J. lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and required immediate medical attention.  

14. J.J. was transported to the emergency department, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  

15. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, J.J. suffered physical injury, pain, and emotional distress, and Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $5,800 and lost approximately $1,200 in wages caring for his injured child.  

16. Defendant’s employees failed to comply with the standard of care required of reasonable childcare providers and breached their duty to adequately supervise the children entrusted to their care.

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land or operator of a business open to the public owes a duty of reasonable care to those lawfully on the premises, including minors participating in supervised programs. **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).  

19. Childcare providers and youth program operators in Massachusetts owe heightened duties of supervision to minors in their care. **Poysa v. State St. Bank & Trust Co.**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 635 (1987); **Wallace v. Wilson**, 246 Mass. 65 (1923).  

20. Defendant, through its employees and agents, owed J.J. a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising program participants and preventing foreseeable harm.  

21. Defendant breached that duty by failing to maintain adequate staff supervision, ignoring reports of dangerous conduct, and failing to implement reasonable safety protocols. See **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 697 (2000) (negligence requires showing of duty, breach, causation, and damages).  

22. Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of J.J.’s injury and of Plaintiff’s economic loss. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (foreseeability of harm central to proximate cause).  

23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law, including **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which governs comparative negligence, and relevant Massachusetts case law addressing duty and foreseeability, including:  

   - **Afienko v. Harvard Club of Boston**, 365 Mass. 320 (1974);  
   - **Westerback v. Harold F. LeClair Co.**, 4 Mass. App. Ct. 30 (1976);  
   - **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (duty to safeguard persons under one’s care);  
   - **Rogers v. Metropolitan District Comm’n**, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 337 (1984);  
   - **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) (landlord’s duty of care explained);  
   - **O’Sullivan v. Shaw**, 431 Mass. 201 (2000) (foreseeability of harm);  
   - **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (duty owed to invitees).  

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff and his son have suffered and continue to suffer damages, including:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately **$5,800**;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately **$1,200**;  
   c. Pain and suffering; and  
   d. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life.  

25. Plaintiff and his son have complied with all notice and procedural requirements under Massachusetts law.
