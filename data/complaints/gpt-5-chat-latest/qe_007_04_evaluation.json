Thus the quoted proposition overstates and mischaracterizes what Simon v. Solomon actually holds.",

This makes clear that intentional misconduct is not required; foreseeable substantial interference resulting from the landlord\u2019s acts or omissions can constitute a breach.

Gonzalez does not discuss whether a landlord can avoid liability by offering minimal rent reductions or abatements in the face of ongoing, significant interference. The damages discussion focuses on the correct measure for breach of the implied warranty of habitability (using fair market value rather than contract rent) and explicitly rejects the idea that a landlord can nullify the warranty by charging discounted rent, but it does not address the specific concept of minimal rent reductions as a defense to liability for ongoing interference. Thus the proposition, as phrased, is not directly supported by this case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe fact that Gonzalez agreed to pay less for the apartment than its full value as warranted is not controlling. The rule for computation of damages in this area gives a tenant no more than the benefit of the bargain because the implied warranty of habitability is part of the bargain. A landlord cannot nullify the implied warranty of habitability on a dwelling by giving his tenant a discount in rent.\u201d"
