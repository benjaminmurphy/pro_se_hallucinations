**JESSICA THOMPSON**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL SMITH**,  
Defendant.

---

# **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody judgment entered on **May 15, 2021**, in the above-captioned matter, pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (b)**, on the grounds that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare of the minor children. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

## **I. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, **Emma Smith** (age 8) and **Liam Smith** (age 6).  
2. The Defendant, **Michael Smith**, is the father of said minor children and resides within the jurisdiction of this Court.  
3. This Court entered a custody judgment on **May 15, 2021**, granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody and the Defendant visitation on alternating weekends and one midweek evening.  
4. The Norfolk Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter.

---

## **II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

5. At the time the custodial judgment was entered, neither party was involved in a serious romantic relationship, and therefore the judgment contained no provisions regarding new partners or their potential influence on the welfare of the children.  
6. The Defendant has since begun residing with an individual who, upon information and belief, has a **criminal record for assault and battery**, and has previously been the subject of a **restraining order** obtained by a former partner.  
7. The Plaintiff has become aware, through statements from the minor children, that this individual has engaged in **aggressive and threatening behavior** in the children’s presence, including yelling, slamming doors, and on one occasion allegedly grabbing one child’s arm hard enough to leave visible marks.  
8. The Plaintiff is informed that a neighbor contacted law enforcement during a loud argument at the Defendant’s residence while the children were present.  
9. These incidents represent a **substantial and material change in circumstances** since the 2021 order, raising significant concerns about the **physical safety and emotional wellbeing** of the minor children while in the Defendant’s residential care.  
10. The best interests of Emma and Liam require that the current custody and visitation orders be modified to ensure their **safety, stability, and emotional security**.

---

## **III. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

11. Massachusetts law provides that a custody order may be modified “upon a showing that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.” **G.L. c. 208, § 28**; **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)**.  
12. The Court’s paramount concern in all custody matters is the **best interests of the child**, to be determined in light of all relevant circumstances. **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**; **Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**.  
13. Where evidence indicates that a parent’s household presents a risk of harm, courts have found modification and restrictions on visitation to be warranted. **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**; **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.  
14. Massachusetts law prioritizes child safety above all other factors, including parental preferences. **Care & Protection of Walt, 478 Mass. 212 (2017)**; **Care & Protection of Vick, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 704 (2016)**.  
15. In cases involving alleged violence, emotional harm, or dangerous household members, trial courts are authorized to order **supervised visitation or exclude certain individuals** from contact with the children. **Adoption of Ilona, 459 Mass. 53 (2011)**; **Custody of Eleanor, 414 Mass. 795 (1993)**; **Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610 (1986)**.  
16. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 31A**, a history or pattern of abuse by a parent or by a member of that parent’s household shall create a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the child’s best interests to be placed in the custody of that parent.  
17. A related statute, **G.L. c. 209A**, empowers this Court to take protective measures where abuse is shown or reasonably feared.  
18. The facts as alleged show a material change in circumstances, the potential exposure of the minor children to harm, and a resulting need for modified custody provisions.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 215, § 6**, the Probate and Family Court has full equity jurisdiction to issue and enforce custody orders protecting minors.

## **IV. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** has occurred since the entry of the Judgment of May 15, 2021;  
B. Modify the existing custody and visitation order to provide that:  
   1. The Defendant’s parenting time shall occur only **under supervision** at a facility or with a mutually agreed-upon third party until further order of the Court; **or**, in the alternative,  
   2. The Defendant shall ensure that his current domestic partner **not be present or reside in the same dwelling** with the minor children during any visitation or physical custody period;  
C. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests, safety, and welfare of the minor children.
