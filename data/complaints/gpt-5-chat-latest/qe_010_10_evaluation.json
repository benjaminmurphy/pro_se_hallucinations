Although Blackett involves noise from a lounge rather than classic repair/maintenance failures, the court explicitly cites prior Massachusetts cases where failure to supply heat, light, power, or to remedy defective conditions breached quiet enjoyment, and it rejects any distinction between landlord nonfeasance and malfeasance in such circumstances. Thus it supports the proposition that substantial interference arising from neglect of maintenance/repair obligations can constitute a violation of the covenant.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done. Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp., 340 Mass. 124, 127 (1959) (failure to supply light, heat, power, and elevator services).... Although some of our opinions have spoken of particular action or inaction by a landlord as showing a presumed intention to evict, the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling."

The opinion explains that \u00a7 14 is part of a remedial scheme for landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing and concludes that Gem is liable for interfering with quiet enjoyment because it violated its duty to maintain sanitary conditions, allowing repeated flooding that impaired the tenant\u2019s use of the apartment.

It recognizes that a landlord\u2019s omissions can constitute a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment when they permit conditions that seriously interfere with tenants\u2019 use and enjoyment, but it does not involve or discuss negligent or willful failure to remedy physical conditions like mold or ventilation defects.
