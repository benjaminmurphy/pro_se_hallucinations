---

2. Defendant **Mark Thompson** (“Defendant”) is the owner and lessor of the premises located at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (“the Premises”). Upon information and belief, Defendant resides or conducts business in the City of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

3. This action is brought pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, which provides tenants a statutory right to recover damages for a landlord’s interference with the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional threshold for this Court.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about **February 1, 2023**, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent a studio apartment at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of **$1,600**.  
7. During the pre-lease showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling and asked Defendant about them. Defendant represented that the issue was from an **“old leak that had been totally fixed.”**  
8. Plaintiff relied upon Defendant’s statements in deciding to enter the lease.  
9. Shortly after moving in, during the first major rainstorm, water leaked into the unit at the exact location of the prior water stains.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak and requested repairs. Defendant repeatedly dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints, characterizing the issue as “minor” and “cosmetic.”  
11. Over the ensuing months, water continued to leak into the Premises during rainstorms, saturating the ceiling and damaging Plaintiff’s personal property, including a **laptop valued at approximately $900**, and soaking her couch.  
12. Conditions within the apartment have deteriorated; there is now a persistent **musty smell and evidence of mold growth** near the leak.  
13. Plaintiff has suffered **headaches, discomfort, and anxiety**, and has had to move her bed away from the affected area, effectively reducing her usable living space by approximately half.  
14. Despite repeated written and verbal complaints, Defendant has failed to remedy the defective condition.  
15. Defendant’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable and watertight condition, and his disregard for Plaintiff’s right to the quiet use and enjoyment of the apartment, constitute a **breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment** as set forth in **G.L. c. 186, §14**.

### IV. COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(**G.L. c. 186, §14**)

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment “is violated when the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s right to the premises.” *Blackett v. Olanoff*, **371 Mass. 714** (1977).  
19. Defendant’s conduct, including failure to remedy persistent water leaks, constitutes substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises.  
20. Defendant’s failure to act despite notice of the defective condition constitutes an **“omission”** within the meaning of *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, **417 Mass. 273** (1994).  
21. Defendant’s inaction has rendered the apartment damp, moldy, and partially uninhabitable, depriving Plaintiff of the full use of her dwelling and peaceful possession as guaranteed by law.  
22. Massachusetts precedent holds that where a landlord’s failure to repair creates uninhabitable conditions, the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment is breached. *Simon v. Solomon*, **385 Mass. 91** (1982); *Davis v. Comerford*, **483 Mass. 164** (2019).  
23. The lack of proper maintenance and failure to repair violates **G.L. c. 186, §14**, **G.L. c. 239, §8A**, and public policy as announced in *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, **379 Mass. 196** (1979).  
24. Under *Simon v. Solomon*, supra, a landlord’s failure to remedy ongoing water leakage was held to violate both the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the implied warranty of habitability.  
25. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law in every residential lease in Massachusetts. *Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.*, **437 Mass. 708** (2002).  
26. Defendant’s course of conduct, as described herein, constitutes direct and indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of *Jablonski v. Casey*, **64 Mass. App. Ct. 744** (2005), and *Lowery v. Robinson*, **13 Mass. App. Ct. 982** (1982).  
27. Defendant’s failure to respond to Plaintiff’s repeated requests for remedy, and continued acceptance of rent despite knowledge of the conditions, further constitutes willful and knowing interference, rendering Defendant liable for **multiple damages and attorney’s fees** under G.L. c. 186, §14.  
28. Plaintiff’s damages include loss of the use of half of her apartment, damage to personal property valued at approximately **$900**, personal discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional distress stemming from persistent leaks and mold exposure.  
29. As a result of Defendant’s breaches and statutory violations, Plaintiff is entitled to recovery under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, *Simon v. Solomon*, supra; *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, **410 Mass. 855** (1991); *Young v. Patukonis*, **24 Mass. App. Ct. 907** (1987); and *Miles v. Werner*, **39 Mass. App. Ct. 910** (1995).
