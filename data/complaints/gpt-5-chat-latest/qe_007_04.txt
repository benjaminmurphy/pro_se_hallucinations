1. The plaintiff, **Emily Johnson** (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 2A, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.  
2. The defendant, **David Thompson** (“Defendant”), is an individual and the owner and landlord of the residential building located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.

---

## **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19** and **G.L. c. 223, §2**, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000 and the property that is the subject of this action is located within this division.  
4. Venue is proper in the **Cambridge District Court** under **G.L. c. 223, §2**, because the defendant resides or does business in Cambridge and the events giving rise to this action occurred within this judicial district.

## **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about **June 1, 2021**, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for the apartment at **123 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts** (the “Premises”). Plaintiff currently pays monthly rent in the amount of **$2,200.**  
6. Beginning in or about **October 2025**, Defendant commenced extensive renovation and construction work on the unit directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment.  
7. The construction has included **drilling, hammering, and loud conversation among construction workers** on a daily basis, beginning around **8:00 A.M.** and continuing through approximately **5:00 P.M.**, Monday through Friday.  
8. The noise levels have been **persistent and excessive**, directly interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to work from home and conduct phone and video meetings necessary for her employment.  
9. In addition to the excessive noise, **dust and debris** from construction have entered the Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system, causing discomfort and an unsanitary living environment.  
10. Defendant provided advance notice that renovations would occur, but the scope, duration, and impact of the construction have **far exceeded** what could reasonably have been contemplated or tolerated under a residential lease.  
11. The disruptions have persisted for approximately **two months**, and Defendant has indicated that the construction may continue for **one to two additional months**.  
12. Defendant offered Plaintiff a **$100 rent reduction** for one month but has otherwise failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the disturbance.  
13. Plaintiff has made repeated complaints to Defendant regarding the ongoing disturbances, but Defendant has failed to effectively remedy the interference.  
14. As a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered a **substantial interference with her use and enjoyment** of the Premises, including lost productivity, stress, and discomfort.  
15. Plaintiff seeks **damages of $1,000**, representing a reasonable abatement of rent and compensation for the substantial impairment of her quiet enjoyment.

## **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
### **(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under **G.L. c. 186, §14**, every tenancy in Massachusetts carries an implied covenant that the landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.”  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from acts or omissions that “substantially interfere with a tenant’s tenancy by materially impairing the character and value of the leased premises.” *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).  
19. Actions constituting a breach of quiet enjoyment include **excessive noise, dust, construction activity, and other disturbances** that render the premises unsuitable for their intended purpose. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 718–719 (1977).  
20. A landlord’s failure to control conditions created by the landlord or by others under the landlord’s control—such as construction crews—constitutes a breach of this covenant. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  
21. Defendant, by authorizing and overseeing disruptive construction work directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment, and by failing to take effective steps to mitigate the unreasonable noise and dust entering Plaintiff’s unit, **directly and indirectly interfered** with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
22. A breach of the covenant does not require intentional misconduct where the landlord’s acts or omissions foreseeably cause substantial interference. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).  
23. The interference experienced by Plaintiff was **substantial**, prolonged, and **foreseeable**, given Defendant’s control over the construction project.  
24. The landlord cannot avoid liability merely by offering minimal rent reductions, particularly where the interference continues and is significant. *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 872 (1991).  
25. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is distinct from any implied warranty of habitability, but non-physical disturbances such as noise and dust may still justify damages. *Winchester v. McCue*, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 293 (2017).  
26. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, §14**, a tenant whose quiet enjoyment is breached is entitled to **actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**. *See also Simon v. Solomon*, supra.  
27. Plaintiff therefore seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than **$1,000**, along with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as provided by statute.
