WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT**  
_______________________________________  
**EMILY CARTER,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.                                             Civil Action No. ___________  

**JAMES McALLISTER,**  
Defendant.  
_______________________________________  

### COMPLAINT  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant James McAllister (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, § 14, and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Emily Carter** is an individual residing at 456 Green Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.  
2. Defendant **James McAllister** is an individual residing in or conducting business in Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 456 Green Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, § 19** and **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this action involves residential property located within Worcester County and falls within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.  
4. Venue is proper in **Worcester District Court** under **Mass. R. Civ. P. 3** because the events giving rise to the claim occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy for the Premises on or about **May 1, 2022**, with rent of **$1,200 per month**.  
6. Beginning approximately in **September 2025**, Plaintiff began observing **mouse droppings** throughout her kitchen.  
7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition, as required by law.  
8. Defendant responded by placing several mouse traps in the kitchen. Two mice were caught, but the infestation continued, with droppings reappearing weekly.  
9. Defendant attributed the problem to “an old building” and suggested Plaintiff keep her kitchen cleaner, despite Plaintiff maintaining a clean household.  
10. Defendant engaged an exterminator for one visit only; the exterminator advised that **comprehensive building-wide treatment** was needed to eliminate the infestation.  
11. Defendant declined further extermination, citing cost concerns.  
12. As a result, the infestation persisted. Plaintiff remains unable to use her kitchen comfortably, has discarded approximately **$200** worth of contaminated food, and purchased **$80** in pest-proof storage containers.  
13. Plaintiff continues to experience anxiety, inconvenience, and disruption in her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  
14. Defendant’s failure to remedy the infestation constitutes a **breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment**.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**)

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”  
17. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that **rodent or pest infestations** that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use of leased premises constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
   - *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 293 N.E.2d 831 (1973);  
   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997);  
   - *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 431 N.E.2d 556 (1982);  
   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 358 N.E.2d 817 (1977);  
   - *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 629 N.E.2d 1343 (1994);  
   - *Meikle v. Nurse*, 474 Mass. 207, 49 N.E.3d 612 (2016);  
   - *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 506 N.E.2d 1164 (1987);  
   - *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 576 N.E.2d 658 (1991);  
   - *Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.*, 439 Mass. 512, 789 N.E.2d 147 (2003);  
   - *Service Publications, Inc. v. Goverman*, 396 Mass. 567, 487 N.E.2d 520 (1986).  
18. The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from substantial interference by actions or omissions of the landlord that affect the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the premises. *See Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–719.  
19. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable and repeated corrective action despite notice of the infestation constitutes a **knowing or negligent interference** with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
20. The condition of ongoing vermin infestation rendered the apartment partially uninhabitable and interfered with Plaintiff’s health, safety, and comfort, in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, **G.L. c. 239, § 8A**, and the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. § 410.551**.  
21. Defendant’s neglect of extermination responsibilities, after being informed of persistent infestation, demonstrates a **failure to maintain the Premises in habitable condition** in violation of **G.L. c. 239, § 8A** and the reasoning of *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199.  
22. Plaintiff suffered **actual damages** including food loss ($200), costs of pest-proof containers ($80), and diminution in rental value and personal distress due to Defendant’s conduct.  
23. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was **substantial and unreasonable**, entitling Plaintiff to recover damages under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, including **actual and statutory damages**, as well as attorney’s fees (if later represented).

### V. DAMAGES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has sustained damages estimated at **$280**, and additional noneconomic harm including inconvenience, distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.  
25. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual damages or three months’ rent**, whichever is greater. Three months’ rent at $1,200 per month equals **$3,600**.  
26. Plaintiff therefore seeks judgment for treble statutory damages in the amount of **$3,600**, plus interest, costs, and such further relief as this Court deems just.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Emily Carter** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment that Defendant **James McAllister** violated **G.L. c. 186, § 14** by breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory or actual damages as permitted by law, including:  
   - Three months’ rent ($3,600) pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
   - Reimbursement for property damage and related expenses ($280);  
C. Award pre- and post-judgment interest and court costs; and  
D. Grant any additional relief the Court deems proper and just.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
