## COMPLAINT

**Plaintiff, Jessica Reynolds (“Plaintiff”),** for her complaint against **Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”),** states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Reynolds is an individual residing at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.  
2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual landlord who owns and manages the residential rental property located at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing residential tenancies and the **covenant of quiet enjoyment**, **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Worcester District Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §19**, because the premises at issue are located in Worcester County and the defendant conducts business there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about September 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for the apartment at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff has paid the required rent of **$1,400 per month** in full and on time throughout the tenancy.  
7. Beginning around **September 2025**, Plaintiff began noticing **mouse droppings** and other signs of rodent infestation in the kitchen of the leased premises.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem.  
9. Defendant placed a few traps, which caught a limited number of mice, but the infestation continued.  
10. At Defendant’s direction, an exterminator performed a **single limited treatment**, after which the infestation persisted.  
11. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building likely required **comprehensive extermination and sealing** to correct the issue.  
12. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for comprehensive treatment, stating that such measures were unnecessary and too costly.  
13. Plaintiff continues to discover mouse droppings in the kitchen on a weekly basis.  
14. Defendant has asserted that the infestation is “normal for older buildings” and has blamed Plaintiff for insufficient cleanliness, which is both inaccurate and unreasonable given Plaintiff’s maintenance of the premises.  
15. Due to the ongoing infestation, Plaintiff has incurred **out-of-pocket damages** exceeding **$280**, including food loss estimated at **$200** and food storage containers costing approximately **$80**.  
16. Plaintiff suffers **anxiety and distress** from the persistent infestation, damaging her use and enjoyment of her home and kitchen.  
17. Defendant’s failure to adequately remedy the infestation constitutes a breach of **the covenant of quiet enjoyment** implied in all Massachusetts residential leases.  

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, §14)**

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  
19. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of leased premises by the tenant.  
20. Massachusetts common law recognizes that substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
21. The continuing **rodent infestation** renders the premises unfit for ordinary residential use, interfering with Plaintiff’s right to a habitable and sanitary dwelling.  
22. Defendant’s failure to take adequate measures to exterminate and prevent recurrence of vermin, after notice, is an **“interference”** under §14.  

---

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITY AND SUPPORT

23. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every lease and statutorily protected by **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**.  
24. In **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)**, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord is liable for interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment when the landlord’s conduct or omission substantially impairs the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.  
25. In **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)**, the Court held that a landlord’s failure to alleviate water infiltration and nuisance conditions breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
26. In **Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987)**, persistent rodent infestation constituted a breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord failed to take effective remedial action.  
27. In **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979)**, the Court emphasized that landlords must maintain premises in compliance with the **State Sanitary Code** (see **105 C.M.R. 410.550**, vermin prevention).  
28. In **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)**, the SJC recognized that the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment overlap in ensuring tenants a safe, sanitary living space.  
29. **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994)** reiterated that a landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in compliance with housing codes can constitute interference under §14.  
30. **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994)** affirmed that emotional distress damages may be awarded for a breach of quiet enjoyment.  
31. Under **M.G.L. c. 239, §8A**, a tenant may counterclaim or bring direct suit for damages arising from a landlord’s breach of lawful housing obligations.  
32. **Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC, 478 Mass. 697 (2018)** and **Coveney v. President & Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross, 388 Mass. 16 (1983)** confirm that Massachusetts courts will award consequential damages for statutory violations that impair property enjoyment.  
33. Defendant’s conduct violates both **M.G.L. c. 186, §14** and the **State Sanitary Code**, **105 C.M.R. 410.550**, which requires property owners to maintain their premises free from rodent infestation.  

---

### VI. DAMAGES

34. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
  a. Loss of food and personal property:    $200.00  
  b. Cost of food containers and cleaning materials: $ 80.00  
  c. Loss of use and enjoyment of her home, distress, and annoyance: **to be determined at trial**.  
35. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**, Plaintiff is entitled to **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against the Defendant as follows:

A. That the Court find that Defendant **breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment** under **M.G.L. c. 186, §14**;  
B. That Plaintiff be awarded **the greater of three months’ rent ($4,200) or actual damages ($280)** pursuant to §14;  
C. That Plaintiff be awarded **court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees** as provided by law (even if self-represented, may request equitable allowance per court discretion);  
D. That the Court order **Defendant to remediate all rodent infestations** and bring the property into compliance with the **State Sanitary Code**, 105 C.M.R. 410.00 et seq.; and  
E. That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper.

### VIII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.
