### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

---

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson**, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, §28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §20**, and **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7**, to modify the existing custody order entered on **March 15, 2021**, issued by this Court, on the grounds of material and substantial changes in circumstances affecting the best interests of the minor children, **Emily Johnson (age 10)** and **Lucas Johnson (age 8)**.  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children and currently holds primary physical custody under the March 15, 2021 judgment.  
   - Telephone: (617) 555-0123  
   - Email: psm1443@gmail.com

---

### II. JURISDICTION

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, §28**, **G.L. c. 209C, §20**, and **Mass. G.L. c. 215, §§3–6**, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and visitation orders where a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification serves the best interests of the children.  

---

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On March 15, 2021, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody, and awarding the Defendant alternate weekends and one midweek visit.  
5. That Judgment did not include any provisions regarding exposure of the children to romantic partners or third parties residing with either parent.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

6. Since the entry of the prior Judgment, the Defendant, Mark Johnson, has begun cohabitating with an individual who has a **criminal record for assault and battery** and a documented history of domestic violence, including a prior **restraining order** from a former partner.  
7. The Plaintiff has learned from the children that this individual regularly **yells, slams doors, and has acted aggressively** toward the children while they were in the Defendant’s care.  
8. The Plaintiff has observed and documented, including through photographs, **a bruise on the arm of Lucas Johnson** after an incident in which this individual allegedly “grabbed” him during a visit.  
9. A **neighbor called the police** to the Defendant’s residence on one occasion in connection with a **loud argument** while the minor children were present.  
10. These incidents represent a significant and unanticipated **change in circumstances** that materially affects the safety and welfare of the children.  

---

### V. LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITIES

11. The standard for modification of custody in Massachusetts is whether there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the prior order, and whether modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the children**. (**G.L. c. 208, §28; G.L. c. 209C, §20**).  
12. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (holding that a court may modify custody when new conditions affect the child’s welfare).  
13. See **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (material changes in parental fitness and home stability support modification).  
14. See **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (children’s exposure to violence constitutes material change warranting modification).  
15. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests of child is paramount in custody determinations).  
16. See **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (court may alter custody to protect child’s well-being).  
17. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests include safety, emotional security, and stability).  
18. See **Adoption of Arthur**, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 914 (1993) (exposure to domestic violence may render custody arrangement inconsistent with child’s welfare).  
19. See **Hale v. Hale**, 394 Mass. 284 (1985) (modification requires showing of changed circumstances that affect child’s best interests).  
20. See **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976) (court may adjust visitation conditions to ensure protection and stability for children).  

---

### VI. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

21. The Defendant’s current living situation with an individual who has a violent criminal history constitutes a significant alteration to the environment in which the children spend their court-ordered time.  
22. The documented and reported incidents of yelling, physical aggression, and police involvement directly threaten the children’s physical and emotional safety.  
23. The current arrangement does not adequately safeguard the children against potential harm from the Defendant’s cohabitant, creating a substantial risk that did not exist at the time of the original order.  
24. Under **Mason v. Coleman** and **Rosenthal v. Maney**, these circumstances constitute a *material and substantial change* warranting an immediate review and modification of visitation conditions.  

---

### VII. REQUESTED RELIEF

Wherefore, the Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. **Modify** the existing Judgment entered on March 15, 2021, to include provisions prohibiting contact between the children and the Defendant’s current cohabitant, or, in the alternative, requiring all visitation between the Defendant and the minor children to be **supervised** by an approved third party or agency;  

B. Order such supervision to continue until the Court is satisfied that the environment is safe and stable for the children;  

C. Issue **temporary orders** as necessary pursuant to **Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 65** to ensure the immediate protection of the minor children pending final hearing;  

D. Grant such other and further relief as justice and equity may require.  

---
