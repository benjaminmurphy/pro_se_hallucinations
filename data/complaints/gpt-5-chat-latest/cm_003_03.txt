v.  

**MICHAEL BROWN,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20)

**Filed:** December 1, 2025  

---

### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Taylor, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Brown, residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of **Ethan Brown**, age 8 (born in 2017).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to **G.L. c. 215, § 6** and **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which empower the Probate and Family Court to modify judgments relating to child custody and visitation upon a material and substantial change in circumstances.

5. Venue is proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** because both parties and the minor child reside in Middlesex County, and the original custody judgment was issued in this division.

---

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court entered a **Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time** awarding the parties **shared legal custody** of Ethan Brown, with primary physical residence with Jessica Taylor and parenting time to Michael Brown on alternating weekends.

7. At the time of that judgment, the Court found both parties stable and capable of cooperative co‑parenting.

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the May 15, 2021 custody judgment, circumstances have materially and substantially changed regarding the welfare and safety of the minor child.

9. Within the past year, Plaintiff has observed and received concerning information suggesting that Defendant may be abusing alcohol or other intoxicating substances while the child is present.

10. Ethan has reported to Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home and that Defendant sometimes “cannot walk straight.”

11. A neighbor known to both parties has provided Plaintiff with a video depicting Defendant stumbling and appearing impaired while removing Ethan from a car late at night.

12. Ethan’s school has reported to Plaintiff that Ethan appears **exhausted and irritable on Monday mornings** following weekends scheduled with his father.

13. Plaintiff has attempted good‑faith communication with Defendant about these concerns, but Defendant has been dismissive and has not taken steps to address or reassure about these incidents.

14. These circumstances place Ethan’s emotional health and physical safety at risk, constituting a **material and substantial change** in circumstances under **Massachusetts law**, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time order.  

---

### V. APPLICABLE LAW

15. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, the Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or visitation order upon a showing of a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the best interests of the child.

16. The controlling standard is the **best interests of the child.**  See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

17. The Court must assess whether a change of circumstances has occurred that affects the child’s welfare significantly enough to require modification. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

18. Massachusetts recognizes that evidence of **substance abuse or impaired parenting** may constitute such a change. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Care and Protection of Isaac*, 419 Mass. 602 (1995).

19. A parent’s responsibility includes protecting the child from exposure to unsafe environments and impaired caretaking. See *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

20. The Court retains continuing jurisdiction to revise or revoke custody orders when the welfare of the minor child so requires. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

21. Allegations of parental impairment have consistently been found sufficient to reopen custody determinations where corroborated by observations, third‑party reports, or school impacts. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

22. The substantial and continuing risk to Ethan’s welfare, as detailed above, satisfies the legal standards for modification and warrants safeguarding orders in his best interests.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff **Jessica Taylor** respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. **Find** that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the May 15, 2021 judgment;

B. **Modify** the custody and parenting‑time provisions of said judgment to provide:

   1. That Plaintiff shall retain **sole physical custody** and primary residence of the minor child, **Ethan Brown**;  
   2. That Defendant’s parenting time be **conditioned upon sobriety** and shall occur **under supervision** until such time as Defendant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Court that he can provide a safe environment;  
   3. That Defendant be required to **participate in an alcohol assessment** and any recommended treatment or monitoring;  
   4. That legal custody remain shared only if communication is effective and consistent with Ethan’s best interests; otherwise, Plaintiff requests **sole legal custody** upon further hearing; and  
   5. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the welfare and best interests of the minor child.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff therefore prays that the Court:

- Conduct a hearing on this Complaint for Modification;  
- Determine that the safety and best interests of the minor child require revision of the judgment; and  
- Enter an amended custody order as set forth above.

---

### VIII. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE
