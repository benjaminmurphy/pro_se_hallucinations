The quoted concurring passage criticizes treating trespassers differently, which presupposes that the majority has already extended a reasonable-care duty to all lawful entrants. Thus, the case supports the proposition that Massachusetts property owners/occupiers owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors, though it stops short of fully extending that duty to trespassers.",
