In affirming the custody award, the court focuses on the harm to the child from the mother\u2019s conduct (wrongful removal, instability, alienation) and expressly endorses awarding custody to the parent who can best support the child\u2019s overall needs, even though both parents are legal parents. This aligns with the principle that parental rights to custody/visitation must yield to the child\u2019s safety and welfare.",
