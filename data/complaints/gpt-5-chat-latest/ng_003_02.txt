#### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On **September 15, 2023**, Plaintiff was shopping in the kitchenware aisle of Defendant’s HomeGoods Superstore located at 1202 Westford Street in Lowell.  
8. Defendant and its agents and/or employees had stacked heavy boxes of small appliances—including toaster ovens—five or six boxes high on open shelving, without securing the boxes with straps, barriers, or other safety devices.  
9. These boxes were placed at a height and in a manner that created an unreasonable risk of falling and causing injury to customers.  
10. While Plaintiff was browsing the merchandise, another customer’s cart lightly bumped a lower shelf.  
11. Due to Defendant’s improper and unsafe stacking of heavy boxes, at least one large box containing a toaster oven fell from an upper shelf, striking Plaintiff on her shoulder and the side of her head.  
12. Plaintiff immediately experienced pain, dizziness, and a headache.  
13. The store manager came to the scene, filled out an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.  
14. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened and she sought treatment at the **emergency department**.  
15. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a **mild concussion** and a **shoulder strain** and was advised to refrain from work and physical activity.  
16. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff—employed as a **delivery driver**—was unable to work for several days, losing approximately **$1,200 in wages**, and incurred **$2,500 in medical expenses**.  
17. Plaintiff was also unable to participate in recreational and social activities, including her weekly soccer league, for approximately a month.  
18. The injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiff were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence in maintaining its premises in a dangerous and unsafe condition.

19. Plaintiff restates and re-alleges each of the foregoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

21. Defendant had a duty to inspect its aisles, displays, and shelving to prevent foreseeable harm to customers. **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
22. Defendant breached that duty by:  
   a. Improperly stacking heavy merchandise in an unstable and unsafe manner;  
   b. Failing to secure merchandise with straps, barriers, or other safety devices;  
   c. Failing to warn customers of the potential hazard; and

26. Massachusetts law recognizes that a store owner owes a nondelegable duty of reasonable care to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition, which extends to the arrangement of merchandise displays. **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); **Perry v. Medeiros**, 369 Mass. 836 (1976); **Cruz v. Dune**, 2018 Mass. App. Div. 45 (2018).  
27. Massachusetts also provides that negligent failure to maintain a safe premises constitutes tortious conduct for which damages may be recovered. **G.L. c. 231, § 85**.  
28. Plaintiff reasonably relied upon Defendant to maintain its premises in a safe condition while she was shopping. **Beaulieu v. Lynn & Boston R.R.**, 164 Mass. 475 (1895).
