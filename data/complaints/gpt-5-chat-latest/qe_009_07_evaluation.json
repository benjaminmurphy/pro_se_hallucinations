The court assumes the existence of the implied covenant in these particular leases and focuses on whether the landlords\u2019 conduct constituted a breach/constructive eviction, not on the universal scope of the covenant across all residential tenancies.

The court\u2019s reasoning is focused on zoning uniformity, property injuries from land-use restrictions, and the standards for invalidating zoning provisions as applied, not constructive interference with quiet enjoyment.
