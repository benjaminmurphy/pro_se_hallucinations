      "support_reasoning": "The opinion directly states that a parent\u2019s ability to separate their own needs from the child\u2019s and not compromise the child\u2019s relationship with the other parent is a relevant factor in custody determinations, citing Hernandez v. Branciforte. The court affirms an award of sole legal custody and a suspension of the father\u2019s contact based, in part, on findings that he disparaged the mother to the child and damaged the mother\u2013child relationship. This aligns with the proposition that where a parent undermines the other parent\u2019s relationship or cannot communicate appropriately, shared legal custody should not continue.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "As the judge correctly noted, \u201c[a] determination of whether a parent is able to separate his or her needs and interests from those of the minor children and whether a parent\u2019s actions will compromise the minor children\u2019s relationship with the other parent are relevant factors in determining custody.\u201d See Hernandez v. Branciforte, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 220-221 (2002). Finally, the judge explained why neither unsupervised nor supervised visitation between the father and the child was feasible.... The judge\u2019s decision to suspend visitation for one year is also supported by his extensive findings that ... in his interactions with the child, [the father] had damaged the mother\u2019s relationship with the child."
