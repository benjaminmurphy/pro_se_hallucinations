### I. PARTIES

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”) resides at 12 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.  
2. **Defendant:** Mark Lawson (“Defendant”) is an individual who owns and acts as landlord of the property located at 12 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as this matter involves a claim for damages not exceeding $50,000 arising under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  
4. Venue in the Somerville District Court is proper because the real property that is the subject of this action is located within the jurisdiction of this Court, and the Defendant does business in Somerville.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for the premises at 12 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).  
6. The lease provides that Plaintiff is entitled to the “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises as secured by law.  
7. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent of $1,800 per month in full and on time.  
8. In or around June 2025, new tenants moved into the third-floor apartment of the same building owned and managed by Defendant.  
9. Since that time, those tenants have caused persistent and excessive noise, including loud music, stomping, and moving furniture late at night and in the early morning hours, disturbing Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and live peacefully.  
10. Plaintiff repeatedly complained—approximately five or six times—to Defendant regarding the disturbances between June 2025 and November 2025.  
11. On one occasion, Defendant spoke with the upstairs tenants but took no further action, stating to Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”  
12. The noise and disturbances have continued unabated, severely impacting Plaintiff’s daily life, causing sleep deprivation, emotional distress, disciplinary action at work, and necessitating medical treatment, including prescription sleep medication costing Plaintiff approximately $40 per month.  
13. Plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to mitigate the problem by using earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranging furniture, all to no avail.  
14. Defendant has failed to take meaningful steps to correct or abate the noise conditions, despite having control over the property and the upstairs tenants through his landlord–tenant relationships.  
15. As a result, Plaintiff has suffered significant loss of use and enjoyment of her home and incurred damages estimated at $5,000.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates Paragraphs 1–15 as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for damages or other relief.  
18. The Defendant, by failing to address the continuing noise nuisance created by other tenants in the same building under his control, has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  
19. Massachusetts law recognizes that the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from “serious interference with their tenancy.” *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–718 (1977).  
20. In *Blackett*, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 where the landlord fails to control other tenants or activities on the property that substantially interfere with another tenant’s use and enjoyment.  
21. Other Massachusetts courts have similarly held landlords responsible for failing to abate disturbances by other tenants: *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985); *Hemingway v. Lanier*, 174 Mass. 589 (1899); *Lipschitz v. Plunkett*, 175 Mass. 55 (1900); *Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004); *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
22. Defendant’s repeated failure to take reasonable measures constitutes an “indirect interference” under the statute because his inaction allowed conditions within his control to persist, foreseeably causing Plaintiff to lose the use and enjoyment of her home.  
23. Defendant’s conduct was continuous, substantial, and unreasonable, rendering the premises partially uninhabitable and depriving Plaintiff of quiet enjoyment.  
24. Plaintiff has suffered significant harm, including loss of sleep, emotional distress, work-related repercussions, medical expenses, and decreased habitability of her apartment.  
25. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
