SARAH JOHNSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK THOMPSON,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is:  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

2. The Defendant, Mark Thompson, upon information and belief, is an individual who has been residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts but has expressed his intent to relocate to the State of New Hampshire for a job opportunity.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - Emily Johnson, date of birth: ____________, age 8 (“Emily” or “the minor child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (as applicable), which authorize the Probate and Family Court to make and modify orders relative to the custody, visitation, and support of minor children.

5. The original custody and parenting‑time order at issue was entered by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court on April 15, 2021 (“Original Judgment” or “Existing Order”).

6. Massachusetts is the minor child’s “home state” within the meaning of the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G.L. c. 209B, § 2, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions, and this Court has jurisdiction to modify its prior custody and parenting‑time order.

7. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the Original Judgment was issued by this Court and the minor child has resided in Middlesex County during the relevant period. See G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6; G.L. c. 208, § 28.

### III. PRIOR ORDER

8. On April 15, 2021, this Court entered a judgment and/or order regarding legal and physical custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child.

9. Under the Existing Order, Mother has primary physical custody of Emily, and Father has parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend.

10. The Existing Order was entered when both parties resided in or near the Cambridge area, within relatively close geographic proximity to one another and to Emily’s school.

11. The Existing Order and the parenting‑time schedule were premised on the assumption that the parties and the minor child would continue to live in close proximity, such that weekday overnights would not significantly interfere with Emily’s schooling, extracurricular activities, sleep, or general well‑being.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the Existing Order on April 15, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

13. Father now seeks and/or intends to relocate his residence to the State of New Hampshire for a job opportunity, while retaining the same parenting‑time schedule set forth in the Existing Order.

14. Father’s contemplated relocation would place his residence approximately ninety (90) minutes away from the minor child’s school and primary residence, in typical traffic conditions, each way.

15. Maintaining the midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time in the context of Father’s relocation would require Emily to undertake extended automobile travel—approximately ninety (90) minutes each way—in the middle of the school week, including early‑morning return trips to attend school on time the following day.

16. The extended travel time necessary to effectuate the midweek overnight in light of Father’s relocation will:  
    a. Significantly reduce Emily’s sleep;  
    b. Increase her fatigue and stress on school days;  
    c. Interfere with her ability to participate fully in after‑school and extracurricular activities; and  
    d. Diminish the quality of her school attendance, preparation, and performance.

17. Emily has already demonstrated anxiety and distress about the prospect of lengthy midweek drives to and from Father’s anticipated New Hampshire residence and the resulting disruption of her routine and after‑school activities.

18. As a result of the anticipated relocation and the new distance between the parties’ homes, the parenting‑time schedule that was appropriate and workable in 2021 has become impracticable, unduly burdensome, and contrary to the minor child’s best interests. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19. Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification of a custody or parenting‑time order must demonstrate (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment, and (2) that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 182–83 (2006); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003).

20. Father’s relocation out of state, combined with the substantial increase in travel time for Emily during school nights and the related interference with her schooling and activities, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (changes in a child’s schooling and practical arrangements may justify modification); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

21. Continuation of the midweek overnight parenting‑time schedule in the context of Father’s substantial relocation would no longer serve Emily’s best interests and is likely to be detrimental to her emotional well‑being, educational development, and overall stability. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of a Minor (No. 1)*, 377 Mass. 876 (1979).

22. Massachusetts courts emphasize that the “best interests of the child” standard is the paramount consideration in matters affecting custody and parenting time. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998). The court must consider the child’s welfare, stability, and continuity of care.

23. It is in Emily’s best interests to have a parenting‑time schedule that:  
    a. Supports her regular school attendance and performance;  
    b. Preserves her ability to participate consistently in after‑school and extracurricular activities;  
    c. Maintains a stable, predictable weekly routine; and  
    d. Minimizes unnecessary stress, fatigue, and anxiety, particularly on school nights.

24. Given Father’s relocation and the distance involved, the Wednesday midweek overnight is now incompatible with these best‑interest factors and should be removed or substantially modified. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (modification may be warranted where changed circumstances impact the child’s day‑to‑day welfare and schedule).

25. The requested modification seeks to realign the parenting‑time schedule with the realities of the parties’ residences and Emily’s schooling, while preserving and promoting a meaningful and substantial relationship between Emily and Father through adjusted weekend and/or non‑school‑night parenting time.

26. Mother does not seek to interfere with or diminish the quality of Emily’s relationship with Father; rather, she seeks a parenting‑time structure that is realistic, sustainable, and truly in Emily’s best interests in light of Father’s decision to relocate. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998) (recognizing the importance of both parents’ involvement, within the framework of the child’s best interests).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

27. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and controlling case law, including *Custody of Kali*, *Mason v. Coleman*, and *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, the Court must focus on the child’s best interests, giving significant weight to the child’s need for stability, continuity, and a schedule compatible with his or her schooling and developmental needs.

28. Emily is eight (8) years old, of elementary‑school age, and requires sufficient sleep, consistent daily routines, and regular access to school‑based and community‑based activities.

29. For a child of Emily’s age, multiple late‑evening drives and extremely early‑morning commutes on school days are unreasonable and place an undue burden on her physical and emotional health.

30. The current schedule, if applied to Father’s New Hampshire residence, would cause:  
    a. Late arrivals at Father’s residence on school nights;  
    b. Early departures the following morning;  
    c. Increased risk of tardiness or absences from school; and  
    d. Heightened anxiety about school, performance, and social activities.

31. Emily has already expressed anxiety about the long drives, the possibility of missing after‑school activities, and the disruption to her daily routine.

32. Courts in Massachusetts have recognized that substantial changes in a parent’s residence, employment, or schedule—when they significantly affect the child’s routine—may justify modification of parenting time to protect the child’s best interests. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Nystrom v. Nystrom*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 1018 (1982) (rescript); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

33. In considering modifications of custody and parenting time, Massachusetts courts also consider the willingness of each parent to support the child’s relationship with the other parent, together with the practicality of any proposed schedule. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. at 190–91.

34. Mother remains willing and committed to fostering a meaningful and consistent relationship between Emily and Father and, to that end, proposes adjustments to the weekend schedule and/or additional parenting time during school vacations or on non‑school nights, rather than burdensome school‑night overnights.

35. The modification sought by Mother is narrowly tailored to address the specific harm and disruption caused by long‑distance travel on school nights, while preserving ample and meaningful contact between Emily and Father.

36. On balance, the requested modification advances Emily’s welfare, stability, and long‑term development, and therefore is required by the best‑interests standard set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the cases interpreting it, including *Custody of Kali*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Mason v. Coleman*, and *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

37. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the April 15, 2021 order and that modification is required in Emily’s best interests.

38. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court enter an order modifying the Existing Order as follows:

   a. Eliminate the midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time with Father while he resides at a location that requires extended travel (approximately ninety minutes each way, or any similarly burdensome commute) between his home and Emily’s school/primary residence on school nights.

   b. Provide instead that Father’s regular parenting time will be exercised on alternate weekends only, with pick‑up after school (or at a mutually agreed time) on Friday and return to Mother on Sunday at a reasonable time to allow Emily to prepare for the school week (for example, by 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, or such other time as the Court deems appropriate).

   c. In recognition of the loss of the midweek overnight and in order to maintain strong and consistent contact between Emily and Father, provide that:  
      i. Father may have reasonable and liberal telephone, video, or electronic contact with Emily on one or more weekday evenings, at reasonable times, so long as it does not interfere with her homework, bedtime, or other essential routines; and  
      ii. The parties will confer in good faith regarding additional parenting time for Father during school vacations, holidays, and/or summer periods, to be allocated in a way that is fair and reasonable and consistent with Emily’s best interests, subject to further order of the Court if the parties are unable to agree.

   d. Clarify that any future relocation by either party that would materially affect Emily’s schooling, routine, or the practicality of the parenting‑time schedule shall be a basis for further modification upon a showing of material and substantial change in circumstances and best interests of the child, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law.

39. Mother further requests that all other provisions of the April 15, 2021 order not inconsistent with the Court’s new order remain in full force and effect.

40. To the extent necessary, Mother requests a temporary order pending final hearing, modifying parenting time to remove the midweek overnight if and when Father relocates to New Hampshire or to any other location that causes similarly burdensome travel for Emily on school nights, so as to prevent ongoing harm and disruption to her schooling and routines. See G.L. c. 208, § 34; *Bercume v. Bercume*, 428 Mass. 635 (1999).

### VII. LEGAL BASIS

41. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties... as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

42. Under controlling precedent, including but not limited to *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); and *Nystrom v. Nystrom*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 1018 (1982), a modification is appropriate when (a) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, and (b) modification is in the best interests of the child.

43. Father’s decision and/or intent to relocate substantially increases travel time for the minor child on school nights, disrupts the assumptions underlying the Existing Order, and adversely affects Emily’s education, sleep, and emotional well‑being, thereby satisfying the “material change” requirement.

44. Adjusting the schedule to remove the midweek overnight and to emphasize weekend and non‑school‑night parenting time is narrowly tailored to the changed circumstances and is in Emily’s best interests.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2021 custody and parenting‑time order;

B. Find and rule that modification of the Existing Order is necessary and appropriate in order to serve the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson;

C. Enter a modified judgment or order that:

   1. Eliminates the midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time with Father while Father resides in New Hampshire or any other location that requires extended travel for Emily on school nights;

   2. Establishes a revised parenting‑time schedule that provides Father with alternate weekend parenting time, with pick‑up after school or at a reasonable agreed‑upon time on Friday and return to Mother at a reasonable time on Sunday, as the Court deems appropriate;

   3. Provides Father with reasonable and liberal telephone, video, and/or electronic contact with Emily on weekday evenings, at reasonable times that do not interfere with Emily’s homework, sleep, or extracurricular activities;

   4. Encourages and/or sets forth additional parenting time for Father during school vacations, holidays, and/or summer periods, in a manner consistent with Emily’s best interests and subject to the Court’s approval or further order;

   5. Orders that all other provisions of the April 15, 2021 order not inconsistent with the modified order shall remain in full force and effect;

D. Issue such temporary orders as may be necessary pending final judgment to protect Emily’s welfare, including temporary suspension of midweek overnights should Father relocate before final judgment;

E. Award Mother her costs related to this action as permitted by law; and

F. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
SARAH JOHNSON,
