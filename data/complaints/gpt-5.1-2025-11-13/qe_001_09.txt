**COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows against Defendant William Carter (“Defendant”):

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is an individual residing at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

2. Defendant William Carter is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the common law and G.L. c. 186, § 14, governing the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000. Plaintiff seeks actual damages of approximately Six Hundred Dollars ($600), plus statutory and multiple damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees as allowed by law.

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Municipal Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 1, 19, and 19A because the Premises are located in Boston (Dorchester neighborhood) and the events giving rise to this action occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about August 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a two-bedroom apartment located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, MA 02124 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

7. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Apartment is Two Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($2,200), payable to Defendant.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the owner and landlord of the Premises and has had responsibility for providing heat and maintaining the heating system in compliance with Massachusetts law.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent as required by the tenancy and has complied with her material obligations as a tenant.

10. During the winter heating season of 2024–2025, and particularly during the colder months, Plaintiff’s heat repeatedly malfunctioned in the evenings.

11. Specifically, on numerous occasions during the winter, the temperature in the Apartment would drop to approximately sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, usually in the evenings and nighttime hours.

12. Massachusetts regulations require that, during the heating season (September 15 through June 15), the temperature in a dwelling unit must be at least 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., and at least 64°F at all other hours. See 105 C.M.R. 410.201 (formerly 410.200) (State Sanitary Code).

13. The repeated evening temperature drops to approximately 60°F constituted a failure to maintain the Apartment in compliance with the State Sanitary Code’s minimum heat requirements.

14. Plaintiff notified Defendant about the heating problems during the winter, informing him that the Apartment was becoming uncomfortably cold and that the heat appeared to be cutting out or failing to maintain a reasonable temperature.

15. In response, Defendant twice sent repair persons to inspect the heating system/boiler.

16. After the first visit, the repair person reported that the problem had been fixed, and the heat worked adequately for approximately one week.

17. Thereafter, the prior problem recurred: the heat again failed to maintain adequate temperatures and the indoor temperature again dropped to approximately 60°F for several hours at a time in the evenings.

18. Plaintiff again notified Defendant of the recurring heating problem.

19. On the second occasion, the repair person advised that the boiler was “old but functional” and stated that there was not much more that could be done.

20. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated reports, Defendant failed to ensure that the heating system was repaired or upgraded to the point that it could reliably maintain code-compliant and habitable temperatures in the Apartment during the winter.

21. The heating problem persisted, and the Apartment remained intermittently and significantly underheated during cold weather, particularly in the evenings.

22. Because Defendant failed to provide adequate and reliable heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two portable electric space heaters to make the Apartment livable.

23. As a direct result of using space heaters to compensate for the inadequate heat, Plaintiff’s electric bill increased by approximately One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150) per month during the relevant winter months.

24. The use of space heaters and the still-insufficient ambient temperature in the Apartment made living conditions uncomfortable, stressful, and difficult for Plaintiff.

25. In or around January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis.

26. Plaintiff’s doctor advised that Plaintiff’s bronchitis was likely exacerbated, aggravated, or made more severe by the cold indoor air and inadequate heat in Plaintiff’s home.

27. Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work due to bronchitis and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics and related prescriptions.

28. Plaintiff’s missed work and medical expenses caused her direct financial losses.

29. Plaintiff also suffered physical discomfort and illness due to the cold conditions, and emotional distress and anxiety from living for extended periods in an underheated home and worrying about her health and the safety and habitability of the Premises.

30. When Plaintiff complained, Defendant responded that the heat was “working” because it never went completely out and because, in his view, the building was not “freezing.”

31. Defendant refused or failed to take additional reasonable steps to correct the recurring problem or to replace or sufficiently repair the “old” heating system, despite knowing that it was not consistently maintaining adequate temperatures in Plaintiff’s Apartment.

32. At all relevant times, the inadequate heat and sub-code temperatures constituted a condition that materially impaired the health, safety, and comfort of Plaintiff in the use of her home.

33. The inadequate heat and Defendant’s failure to fully remedy the problem substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

34. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises were adversely affected every time the Apartment became underheated, forcing Plaintiff to rely on space heaters, bundle up indoors, and endure uncomfortable and unhealthy living conditions.

35. Defendant had actual knowledge of the heating problems and their impact on Plaintiff’s living conditions through Plaintiff’s complaints and the visits and reports of the repair persons.

36. Despite this knowledge, Defendant failed to take effective steps to ensure that the heating system was repaired or replaced so that Plaintiff would have reliable, code-compliant heat throughout the winter.

37. Defendant’s conduct and omissions were at least negligent, if not reckless or willful, in failing to ensure that Plaintiff’s Apartment met basic habitability and heating standards.

38. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff suffered economic damages, including increased electric utility costs (approximately $150 per month for multiple months), lost wages, and medical and prescription costs, together with non-economic damages including discomfort, illness, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

39. Plaintiff estimates that her actual out-of-pocket and related damages total at least Six Hundred Dollars ($600), exclusive of any statutory or multiple damages and fees provided by law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Statutory Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

40. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 39 as if fully set forth herein.

41. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant that the tenant shall have the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, free from interference by the landlord. This covenant is codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14.

42. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” A landlord who violates this covenant is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

43. Massachusetts courts have held that “quiet enjoyment” extends beyond mere freedom from physical entry to include freedom from serious and substantial interference with the tenancy. See, e.g., *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

44. Landlord liability for breach of quiet enjoyment does not require proof of malice or intent; it may be established by showing that the landlord’s acts or omissions, in the circumstances, had the natural and probable consequence of interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715–718 (1977).

45. A landlord’s failure to maintain an apartment in compliance with the State Sanitary Code may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the conditions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–852 (1997); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 790–791 (1994).

46. Adequate heat during the heating season is a basic service and requirement under the State Sanitary Code. See 105 C.M.R. 410.201; see also G.L. c. 111, § 127A (authorizing minimum standards for habitability); *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 373 Mass. 184, 191–196 (1977) (recognizing habitability standards and tenant protections).

47. Defendant, as landlord, had a duty to maintain the Premises, including the heating system, in a condition that complied with applicable health and safety codes and did not unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home. See *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 373 Mass. at 192–197; G.L. c. 239, § 8A (recognizing breach of warranty and code violations as defenses and counterclaims); G.L. c. 186, § 14.

48. The repeated failures of the heating system to maintain adequate temperature in the Apartment during the winter, and Defendant’s failure to effectively correct the problem after being notified, constituted a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

49. The substandard heat and resulting cold indoor temperatures materially affected Plaintiff’s health, safety, comfort, and use of the Premises, requiring her to purchase and operate space heaters and still endure uncomfortable and unhealthy living conditions.

50. Under Massachusetts law, a condition of inadequate heat in violation of the State Sanitary Code can support a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 790–791; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–853; *Lin v. Lowell Hous. Auth.*, 103 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5–7 (2023) (habitability and interference with use).

51. Defendant’s inaction and failure to ensure code-compliant heat, despite knowledge of the ongoing problem, had the natural and probable effect of interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, thereby breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 716–718.

52. Defendant’s conduct occurred in the context of the landlord–tenant relationship and concerned services (heat and habitability) that are central to a residential tenancy; Defendant had control over the building’s heating system and the ability, through repair or replacement, to correct the problem. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 790–791.

53. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was not isolated or trivial, but rather repeated, ongoing, and significant during the winter months, when heat is essential to the reasonable and safe use of a dwelling.

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Increased electricity costs from purchasing and operating space heaters (approximately $150 per month for several months);  
   b. Out-of-pocket medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics and related treatment for bronchitis;  
   c. Lost wages from missing approximately three days of work; and  
   d. Physical discomfort, illness, and emotional distress associated with living in an underheated and unhealthy home.

55. Plaintiff estimates her actual damages to be at least Six Hundred Dollars ($600), but reserves the right to prove a greater amount at trial.

56. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for either (a) three months’ rent or (b) Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

57. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $2,200. Three months’ rent is therefore $6,600.

58. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover statutory damages of at least $6,600 (three months’ rent), or actual and consequential damages if greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

59. Defendant’s conduct also violated public policy expressed in Massachusetts statutes and regulations requiring habitable housing, including G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; and 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

60. Massachusetts courts consistently enforce the covenant of quiet enjoyment in circumstances where a landlord’s failure to maintain habitable conditions or essential services materially interferes with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005); *Lin v. Lowell Hous. Auth.*, 103 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2023).

61. Accordingly, Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to the statutory remedies provided by that statute, including statutory or multiple damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees.
