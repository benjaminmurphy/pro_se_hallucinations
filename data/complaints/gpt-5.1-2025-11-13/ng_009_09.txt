Plaintiff,

v.

**LYNN APARTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC.,**  
Defendant.  


### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE)


Plaintiff David Martinez (“Plaintiff”), acting pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, Inc. (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff David Martinez is an individual residing on the third floor of the residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts 01901 (“the Property”).

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation with its usual place of business in or around Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled the Property located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA 01901.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for personal injuries and property damage arising out of Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain smoke detectors and fire safety equipment in the common areas of a residential apartment building in Lynn, Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds $7,500, which is within the jurisdictional limits of the Lynn District Court for civil actions in tort. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A.

5. Venue is proper in the Lynn District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts, and the Property is located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 223, § 8.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful residential tenant of an apartment unit on the third floor of the Property at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA 01901.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord and property manager, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the common areas of the building, including hallways and stairwells, in a reasonably safe condition. See G.L. c. 186, § 15; *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to lawful occupants).

8. The common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment door on the third floor was equipped with a smoke detector, which Defendant was responsible for installing, maintaining, and keeping in good working order.

9. For months prior to July 15, 2023, the smoke detector in the third‑floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit emitted intermittent “chirping” noises, indicating a low or failing battery.

10. Eventually, an unknown person—believed to be a resident or visitor—removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector, apparently to stop the chirping, and left the battery sitting on the windowsill in the common hallway.

11. After the battery was removed, the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment was non‑functional and incapable of providing any audible warning of smoke or fire in the building.

12. Plaintiff personally observed that the battery had been removed and that the smoke detector was non‑functional.

13. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the non‑functional hallway smoke detector and missing battery on at least three separate occasions over a period of months before July 15, 2023.

14. On each such occasion, Plaintiff informed Defendant, by phone or in person, that:

   a. The hallway smoke detector outside his apartment had been chirping due to low battery;  
   b. The battery had been removed and was sitting on the windowsill; and  
   c. The detector was no longer operational.

15. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant’s representative or agent repeatedly stated that Defendant would “take care of it” or words to that effect.

16. Despite these assurances, Defendant failed to replace the battery or otherwise repair or replace the hallway smoke detector for a substantial period of time before July 15, 2023.

17. Defendant therefore had actual notice and, at a minimum, constructive notice that the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment was not functioning and posed a serious safety hazard to Plaintiff and other tenants.

18. On or about the night of July 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first‑floor apartment at the Property, reportedly originating in the kitchen area.

19. The fire produced significant smoke that rose through the building and entered the stairwells and hallways, including the common third‑floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment.

20. Because the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit had no battery and was non‑functional, it did not sound any alarm in response to the presence of smoke.

21. Plaintiff did not receive any earlier warning of the fire from the hallway smoke detector or from any other building alarm system.

22. Plaintiff first became aware that something was wrong when he smelled smoke inside his apartment.

23. By the time Plaintiff opened his door to the hallway, the third‑floor hallway was already filled with thick smoke.

24. Plaintiff attempted to evacuate the building by traveling through the smoke‑filled hallway and descending the stairs.

25. During his escape, Plaintiff experienced significant difficulty breathing due to the dense smoke, became disoriented, and feared for his life.

26. Emergency personnel, including firefighters and emergency medical services, responded to the scene.

27. Plaintiff was transported to a hospital and was treated for smoke inhalation and associated breathing difficulties.

28. Plaintiff remained in the hospital overnight for observation and treatment related to smoke inhalation.

29. As a direct result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred approximately $7,000 in medical expenses, including emergency room treatment, hospital stay, diagnostic testing, and follow‑up care.

30. Plaintiff additionally lost approximately $2,500 in wages because he was unable to work for a period of time due to his injuries and recovery.

31. The fire, smoke, and water used to extinguish the fire caused substantial damage to Plaintiff’s personal property located in his apartment, including but not limited to clothing, furniture, electronics, and household goods, resulting in significant economic loss.

32. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord and manager of the Property, had the right to control, maintain, and repair the common areas, including the third‑floor hallway and its smoke detection devices.

33. Defendant had a statutory and common‑law duty to maintain smoke detectors and fire protection equipment in good working order in common areas of the residential building. See, e.g., G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E, 26F; 527 CMR 1.00 (Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

34. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that a non‑functional hallway smoke detector would deprive occupants of timely warning of a fire and create a foreseeable risk of serious injury or death from smoke and fire.

35. Defendant had ample time and opportunity to remedy the non‑functional hallway smoke detector after receiving multiple complaints from Plaintiff.

36. Defendant failed to inspect, repair, or replace the hallway smoke detector within a reasonable period of time after receiving such notice.

37. Defendant failed to implement reasonable procedures to ensure that smoke detectors and fire alarms in common areas were routinely inspected, maintained, and kept in working order.

38. Defendant’s failure to maintain the hallway smoke detector in a functional condition directly and foreseeably increased the time that Plaintiff remained unaware of the fire and exposed to smoke.

39. If the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment had been properly maintained with an operational battery, it would have sounded an alarm and provided Plaintiff earlier notice of the fire.

40. Earlier warning would have allowed Plaintiff to evacuate the building before the hallway became heavily smoke‑filled, thereby avoiding or significantly reducing his smoke‑inhalation injuries and property damage.

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, including smoke inhalation, breathing difficulties, and associated pain and suffering.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $7,000 and lost wages of approximately $2,500, and he suffered other economic and non‑economic damages, including property damage, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

43. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 42 as if fully set forth herein.

44. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord who retains control over common areas owes tenants a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep those areas in a reasonably safe condition. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *King v. G & M Realty Corp.*, 373 Mass. 658 (1977); G.L. c. 186, § 15.

45. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care with respect to the inspection, maintenance, and repair of smoke detectors, fire‑warning systems, and fire‑safety components located in the common areas of the building.

46. Defendant also owed Plaintiff duties arising out of applicable fire‑safety statutes and regulations, including but not limited to G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E and 26F (requiring smoke detectors in certain residential buildings), and the Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code, 527 CMR 1.00, which collectively require that required fire protection systems, including smoke alarms, be properly installed, maintained, and kept in service. See, e.g., *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) (landowner liability for fire‑safety hazards).

47. Violation of such safety statutes and regulations constitutes evidence of negligence. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990); *Perry v. Medeiros*, 369 Mass. 836, 841 (1976).

48. Defendant breached its duty of care in multiple ways, including but not limited to:

   a. Failing to maintain the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment in proper working condition;  
   b. Failing to replace or reinstall a battery in the hallway smoke detector after it was removed;  
   c. Failing to conduct reasonable inspections of smoke detectors and fire‑warning systems in common areas;  
   d. Failing to respond within a reasonable time to Plaintiff’s multiple complaints and notices that the hallway smoke detector was chirping, that its battery had been removed, and that it was non‑functional;  
   e. Failing to adopt and implement reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that required smoke detectors were functioning at all times; and  
   f. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent landlord and property manager would under the same or similar circumstances.

49. Defendant’s breaches constitute negligence under Massachusetts common law. See *Janes v. Hayden, Harding & Buchanan, Inc.*, 284 Mass. 250 (1933) (landlord liability for failure to maintain common areas); *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837 (1987) (duty to exercise reasonable care where harm is foreseeable).

50. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. The type of harm Plaintiff suffered—smoke‑inhalation injuries and property damage due to lack of timely fire warning—is the very type of harm that proper maintenance of smoke detectors is intended to prevent. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (foreseeability central to proximate cause analysis).

51. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that failure to maintain functional smoke detectors in the common hallway created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of serious injury to occupants in the event of a fire.

52. Plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of Defendant’s failure to maintain the hallway smoke detector and was within the class of persons that fire‑safety statutes and regulations are designed to protect. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355 (1990); *Monahan v. Town of Methuen*, 408 Mass. 381 (1990).

53. Plaintiff acted reasonably under the circumstances in attempting to evacuate the building once he became aware of the fire and smoke. Plaintiff’s conduct did not constitute negligence, nor was it a superseding cause of his injuries.

54. To the extent Defendant claims that some unknown person removed the smoke‑detector battery, that act was or should have been discovered and remedied by Defendant through reasonable inspection and maintenance practices and does not relieve Defendant of liability. See *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37 (2009) (foreseeable intervening acts do not break chain of causation).

55. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages, among others:

   a. Bodily injuries, including smoke inhalation and breathing problems;  
   b. Past and future pain and suffering;  
   c. Emotional distress, fear, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life arising from the fire incident;  
   d. Medical expenses of approximately $7,000, plus any additional amounts reasonably incurred for future treatment;  
   e. Lost wages of approximately $2,500, and any loss of or reduction in earning capacity;  
   f. Damage to and loss of personal property due to smoke, fire, and water; and  
   g. Other incidental and consequential damages.

56. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all such damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with interest and costs, under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85; *Graci v. Damon*, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 160 (1978).
