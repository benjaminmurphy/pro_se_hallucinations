COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Lin (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 45 Harvard Street, Apartment ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.

2. Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Defendant”), is an individual and the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Property”), including Plaintiff’s apartment unit.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought in the Cambridge District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A and G.L. c. 185C, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court and the claims arise out of a residential tenancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

5. Venue in this Court is proper because the Property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Cambridge. See G.L. c. 223, § 2; G.L. c. 212, § 4.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

6. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for an apartment at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Premises”).

7. Under the lease, Plaintiff rents the Premises for a monthly rent of $2,400.00, payable to Defendant.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises since on or about June 1, 2021, and has at all relevant times paid rent and otherwise complied with her material obligations under the tenancy.

9. Plaintiff works from home and regularly conducts telephone and/or video calls, conferences, and other work activities from within the Premises.

10. In or around early October 2025, Defendant commenced renovation and construction work on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment within the same building.

11. Prior to the commencement of construction, Defendant informed Plaintiff that renovation work would occur in the neighboring unit.

12. Since the commencement of said renovation, there has been frequent and substantial construction noise on weekdays, generally from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., including but not limited to drilling, hammering, and loud conversations among workers (the “Construction Activities”).

13. The Construction Activities have been ongoing for approximately two months as of the date of this Complaint and, on information and belief based on Defendant’s statements, are expected by Defendant to continue for an additional one to two months or longer.

14. The noise from the Construction Activities is of such volume, frequency, and duration that it has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as her home.

15. In particular, the Construction Activities have repeatedly interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to concentrate, conduct work-related phone and video calls, and otherwise use her home for normal residential and work-from-home purposes.

16. In addition to excessive noise, dust and debris generated by the Construction Activities have traveled through vents and other openings into the Premises, causing visible dust accumulation in Plaintiff’s unit.

17. The dust infiltration has required Plaintiff to undertake extra cleaning, has affected the air quality in her home, and has further diminished her comfort and use of the Premises.

18. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant about the excessive noise and dust and has requested relief so that she could use and enjoy the Premises as a residence and work space.

19. Defendant has acknowledged the inconvenience caused by the Construction Activities and offered Plaintiff a one-time rent reduction of approximately $100.00 for one month.

20. This offered reduction was minimal and did not reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the continuing and substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises over the course of months.

21. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant has continued to allow the Construction Activities to proceed in substantially the same manner, without implementing adequate measures to mitigate the impact on Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises.

22. The cumulative effect of the Construction Activities, including constant weekday noise, dust infiltration, and disruption over multiple months, has substantially deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of the Premises that is promised under Massachusetts law.

23. Plaintiff has suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her home, stress, inconvenience, and disruption of her work as a direct result of Defendant’s acts and omissions with respect to the Construction Activities.

24. As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff has suffered damages which she reasonably estimates to be approximately $2,000.00, including but not limited to diminution in rental value, loss of use and enjoyment, and consequential harms associated with the substantial interference.

25. At all relevant times, Defendant had the right and ability to control the timing, methods, and conduct of the renovation work and to require contractors to minimize unreasonable disturbance to tenants, including Plaintiff.

26. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to schedule, supervise, or manage the Construction Activities in a manner that would avoid or reduce the substantial and recurring interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

27. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–26 as if fully set forth herein.

28. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease and tenancy-at-will includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and landlords are also subject to the statutory covenant set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Jablonski v. Clemons, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004).

29. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and statutory damages.

30. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to the “freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy—acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leased premises.” Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994) (quoting Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–16 (1977)).

31. Interference by a landlord, or by third parties whose conduct is reasonably attributable to the landlord, can constitute a breach of the covenant. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord responsible where its actions created conditions that led to interference by third parties); Jablonski, 60 Mass. App. Ct. at 476–79.

32. Massachusetts courts have held that substantial, recurring noise and other disturbances, when attributable to a landlord’s acts or omissions, may amount to an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; see also Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

33. Landlords may be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment when they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent or remedy conditions that substantially interfere with tenants’ use and enjoyment, even where the underlying activity is otherwise lawful. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–77 (1994); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982).

34. Defendant, by authorizing, arranging, and controlling the renovation of the adjacent unit, and by failing to take reasonable measures to prevent or mitigate excessive daytime construction noise and dust intrusion into Plaintiff’s unit, has “directly or indirectly” interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

35. The Construction Activities, as managed and permitted by Defendant, have caused sustained, excessive noise from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays for a period of approximately two months to date, with an anticipated continuation for an additional one to two months.

36. The level, duration, and persistence of the Construction Activities have been such that a reasonable tenant in Plaintiff’s position would find that the character and value of the tenancy were substantially impaired. See Doe, 417 Mass. at 285; Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

37. The infiltration of construction dust and debris into Plaintiff’s unit through vents and other openings has further impaired Plaintiff’s comfort, health, and use of the Premises, exacerbating the interference with quiet enjoyment. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (recognizing interference where landlord’s acts or omissions expose tenant to conditions affecting health and safety); per G.L. c. 239, § 8A (linking code-type conditions to quiet enjoyment).

38. Defendant knew or should have known that continuous, loud construction work in an adjacent unit over many weeks would materially interfere with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises, particularly given Plaintiff’s known need to work from home.

39. Defendant had the ability and obligation to manage the renovation in a manner that would minimize the intrusion on Plaintiff’s tenancy—such as by implementing noise and dust control measures, limiting especially disruptive activities, scheduling the work to reduce interference, providing meaningful rent abatement, or offering temporary alternative accommodations—but failed to do so.

40. Defendant’s offer of a one-time rent reduction of approximately $100.00 for a single month, in the face of multiple months of substantial interference, was grossly inadequate and did not cure or meaningfully compensate for the ongoing deprivation of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 14 (providing for actual and statutory damages); Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 776–77 (landlord’s limited or partial response does not negate liability for ongoing interference).

41. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above constitute a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14, and a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized in Massachusetts common law. See Blackett, 371 Mass. 714; Doe, 417 Mass. 273; Jablonski, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to, loss of use and enjoyment of her home, disruption of her work, inconvenience, emotional distress and frustration associated with the noise and dust, and diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises during the period of interference.

43. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her damages arising from Defendant’s breach of quiet enjoyment to be approximately $2,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs.

44. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (to the extent incurred), for his interference with her quiet enjoyment. See Al‑Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 776–78; Jablonski, 60 Mass. App. Ct. at 476–79.

45. To the extent the Court finds that the interference was willful or knowing, or that Defendant unreasonably failed to abate the conditions after notice, enhanced or statutory damages are appropriate under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related authorities. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Doe, 417 Mass. at 285–86; G.L. c. 93A, § 9 (by analogy, regarding knowing or willful interference with consumer rights).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Lin, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Michael Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 with respect to Plaintiff’s tenancy at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts;

D. An award of prejudgment and postjudgment interest as allowed by law, including under G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

E. Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

JESSICA LIN,
