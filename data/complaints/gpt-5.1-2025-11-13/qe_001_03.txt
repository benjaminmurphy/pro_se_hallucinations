                              COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND
            (Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

       Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint
against Defendant Mark Reynolds (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                             I.   PARTIES, JURISDICTION, VENUE

1.     Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual who resides at 123 Ashmont Street,
       Apartment ___, Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02124.

2.     Defendant Mark Reynolds is, upon information and belief, an individual who owns and/or
       manages residential rental property located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester,
       Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”), and is a “landlord” within the meaning of
       Massachusetts landlord–tenant law, including G.L. c. 186.

3.     This is a civil action for breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to
       G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4.     The amount in controversy is less than $50,000.

5.     This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3 and G.L.
       c. 218, §§ 19–19C, because the action concerns the residential rental of real property
       located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester
       Division, and arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

6.     Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Dorchester, Suffolk
       County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred there.

                               II.   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7.     On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for a two‑bedroom residential
       apartment located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the
       “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8.     Plaintiff has continuously rented and occupied the Premises as her home from on or
       about June 1, 2022 through the present.

9.     Plaintiff pays rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,800.00 per month.

10.    At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord and owner and/or manager of the Premises,
       has been responsible for providing and maintaining heat to the Apartment in compliance
       with Massachusetts law, the State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.), and the
       covenant of quiet enjoyment implied by G.L. c. 186, § 14.

11.    The State Sanitary Code requires that the owner of a residential dwelling provide
       heating facilities capable of maintaining certain minimum temperatures. Specifically,
       105 C.M.R. 410.201(A) requires that the heating system be capable of maintaining a
       temperature of at least 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., and at least 64°F at all
       other hours, from September 15 through June 15 each year.

12.    During the winter season of 2024–2025 (approximately November 2024 through March
       2025), the heat in Plaintiff’s Apartment repeatedly malfunctioned.

13.    On numerous days and evenings during that winter, Plaintiff’s Apartment became
       uncomfortably and unreasonably cold. The heat would “cut out” or drop significantly,
       and the indoor temperature would fall to approximately 60°F for several hours at a time,
       usually in the evenings.

14.    These episodes of inadequate heat occurred multiple times per week over the course of
       the winter, substantially reducing the comfort and habitability of the Apartment and
       interfering with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises as a residence.

15.    Plaintiff notified Defendant that the heat was not functioning properly and that the
       temperature in the Apartment was frequently dropping to around 60°F, particularly in the
       evenings.

16.    After Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on one
       occasion. The repair person stated that the issue was fixed.

17.    Following this visit, the heat appeared to function better for approximately one week, but
       then the same problem recurred: the temperature in the Apartment again dropped to
       approximately 60°F for extended periods, particularly in the evenings.

18.    Plaintiff again notified Defendant of the ongoing heating problem.

19.    Defendant sent a second repair person, who examined the boiler and informed Plaintiff
       that the boiler was “old but functional” and that there was not much more that could be
       done.

20.    Despite these service calls, the problem with inadequate heat continued throughout the
       winter season. The heating system repeatedly failed to maintain lawful and reasonable
       indoor temperatures as required by 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and related provisions of the
       State Sanitary Code.

21.    Defendant took no effective action to correct the underlying heating deficiency or to
       provide alternative, adequate heat to Plaintiff.

22.    Defendant has maintained the position that the heat is “working” because the system did
       not fail completely and the building was not “freezing,” despite the recurring failure to
       maintain the minimum required indoor temperatures and the repeated drops to
       approximately 60°F for hours at a time.

23.    As a direct result of the inadequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two portable
       electric space heaters to keep the Premises at a tolerable temperature.

24.    The operation of these space heaters substantially increased Plaintiff’s electric bill by
       approximately $150.00 per month during the winter months when the heating problems
       were occurring.

25.    Plaintiff incurred these additional electricity costs solely because Defendant failed to
       provide adequate heat as required by law and by Plaintiff’s tenancy.

26.    In January 2025, during the period of inadequate heat, Plaintiff developed bronchitis.

27.    Plaintiff’s medical provider informed her that the cold indoor air likely aggravated or
       worsened her bronchitis.

28.    Plaintiff missed approximately three (3) days of work because of her illness and incurred
       additional medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics and related treatment.

29.    The recurrent lack of adequate heat, the resulting cold conditions in the Apartment, and
       the need to run electric space heaters for hours each day caused Plaintiff substantial
       discomfort, anxiety, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

30.    Because of the inadequate heat and cold indoor conditions, Plaintiff was forced to limit
       her normal activities in the Apartment, including having guests, using certain rooms
       comfortably, and maintaining a healthy living environment.

31.    Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises were substantially and materially impaired
       by the repeated heating failures and Defendant’s failure to correct them.

32.    Throughout this period, Plaintiff continued to pay full rent of $1,800.00 per month, even
       though the Premises were not maintained in a condition that complied with the State
       Sanitary Code and the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

33.    Defendant knew or should have known that the recurring heating problem and failure to
       maintain code‑compliant temperatures constituted a serious and continuing interference
       with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

34.    Notwithstanding this knowledge, Defendant failed to take adequate steps to cure the
       condition or provide Plaintiff with alternative adequate heat, a rent reduction, or any
       other meaningful remedy.

35.    Plaintiff estimates that she has sustained at least approximately $600.00 in damages, and
       potentially more, including but not limited to increased utility costs, loss of use and
       enjoyment, and health‑related impacts associated with the inadequate heat.

36.    Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to adjust the damages claimed as
       discovery and documentation (including utility bills and medical records) further clarify
       the extent of her losses.

                      III.   CLAIM – BREACH OF QUIET ENJOYMENT
                                (G.L. c. 186, § 14 – STATUTORY)

37.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

38.    Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet
       enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

39.    G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that if a landlord directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s
       quiet enjoyment of residential premises, the tenant shall be entitled to recover actual and
       consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with court
       costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

40.    Massachusetts courts have long recognized that substantial and continuing code
       violations and failures to provide essential services—such as heat—may constitute an
       unlawful interference with the covenant of quiet enjoyment, even where the landlord’s
       conduct is not malicious or intentional, if the landlord’s actions or inactions are at least
       negligent and cause a serious interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the
       premises.

41.    In Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a
       landlord’s failure over time to correct substantial violations of the State Sanitary Code
       may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

42.    In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a
       landlord’s “interference” with quiet enjoyment need not be intentional or in bad faith; it is
       enough that the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s actions or inactions
       is a serious interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.

43.    In Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994), the Court reaffirmed that a
       landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14, when the landlord’s conduct or failure to
       act results in substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment, including where
       there are persistent unsafe or unhealthy conditions.

44.    In Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994), the Court recognized that housing
       conditions violating the State Sanitary Code can form the basis for claims against a
       landlord, including claims related to habitability and quiet enjoyment.

45.    In Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979), the Supreme Judicial Court
       held that violations of the State Sanitary Code can constitute a breach of the implied
       warranty of habitability, and that rent abatement and damages may be appropriate where
       the landlord fails to remedy code violations, particularly those involving essential
       services such as heat.

46.    In Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), the Court recognized the
       implied warranty of habitability in residential tenancies and held that serious defects that
       violate the State Sanitary Code may justify rent abatement and related relief.

47.    Massachusetts appellate decisions—including, by analogy, cases such as Wesson v.
       Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708 (2002), and Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)—
       make clear that where landlord conduct or neglect causes substantial disturbances,
       unsafe conditions, or persistent interferences, a tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment is
       violated.

48.    Under G.L. c. 239, § 8A, and cases such as Hemingway and Berman & Sons, sustained
       noncompliance with the State Sanitary Code regarding essential services (like heating)
       is treated as a serious breach of the landlord’s obligations and can support rent
       abatement and damages, underscoring that such failures also constitute an interference
       with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

49.    Here, the repeated failure of the heating system to maintain a temperature above
       approximately 60°F for hours at a time during the winter heating season constitutes a
       serious and substantial violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.201, and
       related provisions requiring adequate heat in residential dwellings.

50.    Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain adequate heat, notwithstanding Plaintiff’s
       repeated complaints, is at least negligent and constitutes an “indirect interference” with
       Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, as
       interpreted by Blackett v. Olanoff and its progeny.

51.    Defendant had notice, actual or constructive, that the heating system was not reliably
       maintaining lawful and reasonable temperatures, yet failed to take effective corrective
       action, to upgrade or properly repair the system, to provide alternative adequate heating,
       or to offer a reduction in rent or other remedy.

52.    Defendant’s acts and omissions were the natural and probable cause of the recurring cold
       conditions in Plaintiff’s Apartment, her need to run electric space heaters, her increased
       utility costs, her health‑related problems, and her significant loss of use and enjoyment of
       her home.

53.    The conditions caused by Defendant’s failures were sufficiently serious, frequent, and
       prolonged to materially impair the character and value of the Premises as a habitable
       residence and to substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, in violation of
       G.L. c. 186, § 14.

54.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet
       enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not
       limited to:

       a. Increased electric bills of approximately $150.00 per month during the period when
          Plaintiff had to use electric space heaters due to the inadequate heat provided by
          Defendant;

       b. Out‑of‑pocket medical expenses related to treatment of bronchitis and related
          symptoms that were aggravated by the cold indoor temperatures;

       c. Lost wages or income from missing approximately three days of work due to illness
          associated with the cold living conditions;

       d. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional
          distress associated with living in an inadequately heated apartment during the winter
          months; and

       e. The payment of full contract rent ($1,800.00 per month) despite Defendant’s failure
          to provide a dwelling unit in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and the
          covenant of quiet enjoyment.

55.    Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either her actual and
       consequential damages or three (3) months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with
       court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Three months’ rent at $1,800.00 per month is
       $5,400.00.

56.    Plaintiff, at a minimum, believes she is entitled to monetary relief of not less than
       approximately $600.00 in damages based on the increased utility costs and other harms
       she has sustained to date. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek the full remedy provided by
       G.L. c. 186, § 14, including three months’ rent and additional damages, upon proof at
       trial.

57.    Plaintiff also seeks any equitable and declaratory relief that the Court deems just and
       proper to ensure Defendant’s future compliance with Massachusetts law and the State
       Sanitary Code, including but not limited to orders requiring Defendant to maintain the
       heating system in a condition that consistently meets or exceeds the temperature
       requirements of 105 C.M.R. 410.201.

                                IV.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF

       WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable
Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Reynolds, and grant the
following relief:

A.     A declaration that Defendant has breached Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment in
       violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, by failing to provide adequate heat and by allowing
       conditions to persist that substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of
       the Premises;

B.     An award of monetary damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial,
       including but not limited to:

       1. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including increased utility bills,
          medical expenses, and lost wages;

       2. Damages for loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;

       3. The statutory remedy under G.L. c. 186, § 14, in the amount of Plaintiff’s actual and

          greater;

C.     An award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14,
       recognizing that Plaintiff is currently self‑represented but may incur such fees if she
       retains counsel;

D.     An order requiring Defendant to maintain the heating system at the Premises in
       compliance with 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and all applicable Massachusetts statutes and
       regulations, and to refrain from any future interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment;

E.     Costs of this action pursuant to applicable law;

F.     Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.
