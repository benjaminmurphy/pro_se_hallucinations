                    COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
                (Negligence – Premises Liability / Personal Injury)

Plaintiff Jessica Hall (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant HomeGoods Plus (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

                                      PARTIES

1.   Plaintiff Jessica Hall is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, at all relevant times, was a patron and business invitee at Defendant’s retail store located in Lowell, Massachusetts.

2.   Upon information and belief, Defendant HomeGoods Plus is a business entity organized under the laws of, and/or authorized to do business in, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, operating a retail discount home-goods store located at 1230 Main Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851.

3.   At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, and/or controlled the premises and store located at 1230 Main Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (the “Store” or “Premises”).

4.   At all relevant times, Defendant acted through its agents, servants, and/or employees, all of whom were acting within the course and scope of their employment and authority.

                           JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.   This is a civil action for negligence seeking damages in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A.

6.   This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212 and G.L. c. 218, because Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for personal injuries arising from tortious conduct occurring within Massachusetts and within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court.

7.   Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2, 8 & 9, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the Defendant regularly conducts business at the Store in Lowell, Massachusetts.

                                STATEMENT OF FACTS

8.   On or about September 20, 2023, at approximately 3:00 p.m. (or at another time proven at trial), Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a paying customer and business invitee of Defendant.

9.   On that date and time, Plaintiff was in an aisle of the Store looking at kitchen items, including boxed kitchen appliances such as toaster ovens.

10.  Defendant, through its employees or agents, had stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens, five or six boxes high on shelving in the aisle where Plaintiff was shopping.

11.  These heavy boxes were stacked high above customer head level without any safety restraints, straps, railings, fencing, barriers, netting, or other devices to prevent them from falling.

12.  The boxes were stacked in such a way that they were susceptible to shifting and falling into the aisle where customers, including Plaintiff, would reasonably be expected to walk and shop.

13.  The condition of the shelving and stacked boxes constituted an unreasonably dangerous condition to customers lawfully on the Premises.

14.  While Plaintiff was standing in the aisle examining merchandise, another customer pushed a standard shopping cart down the aisle.

15.  The other customer’s cart made a routine, ordinary contact with a lower portion of the shelving—no harder than could reasonably be expected in the normal course of shopping in a crowded retail store.

16.  Upon that ordinary contact, a large, heavy toaster-oven box that had been stacked near the top of the shelf became unstable, toppled, and fell from the upper shelf onto Plaintiff.

17.  The falling box struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and the side of her head.

18.  As a result of the impact, Plaintiff immediately felt pain in her shoulder, dizziness, and a severe headache.

19.  The sudden blow and resulting symptoms caused Plaintiff to become disoriented and distressed in the Store.

20.  Store employees and/or a manager came to the scene after the incident.

21.  The manager completed an incident report documenting that a box had fallen from a shelf onto Plaintiff in the aisle.

22.  The manager offered Plaintiff a store coupon as a token gesture after the incident, but did not offer to call emergency medical services or otherwise meaningfully address her apparent injury.

23.  Plaintiff left the Store and returned home.

24.  That evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms, including headache, dizziness, and shoulder pain, significantly worsened.

25.  Plaintiff then presented to a hospital emergency department (the “ER”) for evaluation and treatment of her injuries.

26.  At the ER, Plaintiff was evaluated and diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

27.  Plaintiff was advised to rest, limit physical exertion, and follow up with her medical providers; she was also given instructions to avoid activities that could exacerbate her head and shoulder injuries.

28.  At the time of the incident, Plaintiff worked as a delivery driver, a position that requires physical activity, use of the shoulders and arms, and safe, unimpaired operation of a motor vehicle.

29.  Because of the concussion symptoms and shoulder strain, Plaintiff was medically restricted and unable to safely perform her regular work duties for several days following the incident.

30.  As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff missed work and lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00.

31.  Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for ER treatment and related care in the approximate amount of $2,500.00.

32.  Plaintiff’s injuries also prevented her from engaging in her usual recreational activities, including playing in her weekly soccer league, for approximately one month following the incident.

33.  During this period, Plaintiff experienced physical pain, headaches, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, reduced enjoyment of life, and emotional distress related to her injuries and limitations.

34.  At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety while shopping in the Store, including walking normally, remaining in the aisle, and using the Store in a foreseeable and intended manner.

35.  Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the dangerous stacking of boxes or the instability of the shelving.

36.  The ordinary and foreseeable contact of a shopping cart with a store shelf should not cause heavy merchandise to fall from high shelves onto customers, if the merchandise has been properly and safely stored.

37.  Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that stacking heavy boxed merchandise five or six units high above customer head level, without restraints or barriers, in an aisle open to the public, created an unreasonable risk that merchandise could fall and injure customers.

38.  Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that customers routinely use shopping carts in narrow aisles and that incidental contact between carts and shelving is common and foreseeable.

39.  Defendant failed to take reasonable measures to inspect, secure, and/or reconfigure the shelving and heavy merchandise so as to prevent boxes from falling in response to ordinary, foreseeable contact.

40.  Defendant failed to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition posed by the unsecured, high-stacked boxes.

41.  The risk that heavy boxed merchandise might fall from high shelves and strike a customer is a foreseeable risk of harm that reasonable store operators must anticipate and guard against.

42.  The incident in which a heavy box fell and struck Plaintiff was a natural and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in the storage and display of its merchandise.

43.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and other damages, all to her detriment.

44.  Plaintiff’s injuries and damages are continuing in nature, and she reserves the right to prove the full extent of her damages at trial.

                              FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  
                          (Negligence – Premises Liability)

45.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 44 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

46.  At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on Defendant’s Premises.

47.  Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to the condition of the Premises. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (abolishing distinction between invitees and licensees and recognizing a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

48.  As the owner, operator, or person in control of the Store, Defendant owed Plaintiff a nondelegable duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the Premises, including shelves and merchandise displays, in a reasonably safe condition, and to protect her from foreseeable risks of harm. See Dubuque v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 93 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 335–36 (2018).

49.  Defendant also had a duty to conduct reasonable inspections of shelving and merchandise displays and to correct or warn of dangerous conditions that it knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known existed. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermkts., Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 782–84 (2007).

50.  Under Massachusetts negligence law, a defendant is liable where it owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and the breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries, resulting in damages. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 742–43 (1995).

51.  The duty of reasonable care includes the obligation to anticipate and guard against reasonably foreseeable conduct of third persons, including other customers, when such conduct creates a risk of harm to patrons. See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 51–54 (1983); Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).

52.  Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that stacking heavy boxed appliances multiple units high above customer head level, without restraints or barriers, in a high-traffic aisle where carts are used, created an unreasonably dangerous condition.

53.  It was reasonably foreseeable that shopping carts would sometimes make contact with shelving and that unsecured, top-heavy merchandise might fall and injure customers if not properly stored.

54.  Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition created by the manner in which it stacked and displayed its merchandise, because Defendant’s employees created the condition and/or because the condition existed for a sufficient time that Defendant should have discovered and remedied it. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 784–85 (notice may be inferred where defendant creates dangerous condition).

55.  Reasonable retail store practice, consistent with Defendant’s duty of care, required Defendant to (a) avoid stacking heavy boxes to unsafe heights, (b) use restraining devices such as rails, fences, or straps to secure high-stacked merchandise, (c) perform reasonable inspections to detect unstable stacking, and (d) promptly correct or warn of such conditions.

56.  Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:

     a. Failing to safely stack and secure heavy boxed merchandise on the shelves;

     b. Stacking heavy boxes five or six units high above customer head level without restraints, railings, or other safety devices;

     c. Failing to inspect and maintain the shelving and merchandise display so as to prevent falling merchandise;

     d. Allowing a dangerous and unstable merchandise configuration to exist in a customer aisle;

     e. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the risk of falling merchandise;

     f. Failing to adopt or enforce adequate policies and procedures to prevent falling merchandise incidents; and

     g. Otherwise failing to use reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for business invitees such as Plaintiff.

57.  A reasonably prudent retailer, exercising ordinary care under the circumstances, would not have stored heavy boxed appliances in the manner Defendant did and would have taken measures to prevent merchandise from falling in response to ordinary, foreseeable contact with shelving.

58.  Defendant’s breaches of its duty of care were a direct and proximate cause of the incident in which the toaster-oven box fell from the shelf and struck Plaintiff.

59.  Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s mild concussion and shoulder strain, as diagnosed in the ER following the incident. See Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251, 254 (1935) (defining proximate cause); Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002).

60.  Plaintiff did not assume the risk that Defendant would negligently stack and secure heavy merchandise overhead, nor did Plaintiff consent to any unsafe condition.

61.  To the extent, if any, that Defendant contends Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies such contention. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any causal negligence by Plaintiff (which Plaintiff denies) was less than that of Defendant and does not bar recovery; at most, it would reduce damages proportionally.

62.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:

     a. Physical injuries, including a mild concussion and shoulder strain;

     b. Pain and suffering related to her head and shoulder injuries;

     c. Past medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.00, and reasonable future medical expenses as may be incurred;

     d. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00;

     e. Loss of enjoyment of life, including temporary inability to participate in her weekly soccer league and other activities;

     f. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and disruption of her normal daily activities; and

     g. Other compensable damages under Massachusetts law, to be proven at trial.

63.  Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See, e.g., Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 867–69 (1991); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 781–82 (1975).

64.  Plaintiff also seeks statutory interest on any judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B–6C, and costs as allowed by law.

                        COMPLIANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS LAW

65.  This action sounds in negligence under Massachusetts common law, as informed by G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence), and is consistent with the principles set forth in, inter alia:

     a. Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors);

     b. Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermkts., Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007) (premises liability and notice);

     c. Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (elements of negligence – duty, breach, causation, damages);

     d. Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (foreseeability and scope of duty);

     e. Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (duty to protect against foreseeable harm);

     f. Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251 (1935) (causation);

     g. Dubuque v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 93 Mass. App. Ct. 332 (2018) (duties of store operators to patrons);

     h. Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (reasonable care standard for property owners);

     i. Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312 (2002) (foreseeability and proximate cause);

     j. Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (damages and pain and suffering);

     k. and other applicable Massachusetts statutes and case law governing negligence and premises liability.

                              PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hall respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant HomeGoods Plus, and award the following relief:
