Docket No.: ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Defendant” or “Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emma Johnson (date of birth: _____________; age 10) and Jake Johnson (date of birth: _____________; age 8) (together, the “minor children”).

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters concerning the minor children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 19, 28, and 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and applicable case law, including *St. Cyr v. St. Cyr*, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 563 (2009).

4. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the prior Judgment concerning custody and parenting time was issued by this Court, and the parties and children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, § 6.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

5. On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “Original Custody Order”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor children.

6. Under the Original Custody Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the minor children.

7. Under the Original Custody Order, the children primarily reside with the Plaintiff, and the Defendant has parenting time pursuant to a regular visitation schedule (the “Parenting Schedule”).

8. The Original Custody Order further provides that each parent shall support the children’s relationship with the other parent, cooperate with one another, and refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children.

9. The Original Custody Order remains in full force and effect and has not been superseded, vacated, or modified.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

10. A Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody or parenting order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment and that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

11. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

12. The Court may modify joint custody arrangements where one parent’s conduct undermines cooperation, communication, and the child’s relationship with the other parent, thereby making joint custody unworkable or contrary to the children’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Marden v. Marden*, 345 Mass. 505 (1963).

13. Interference with a child’s relationship with the other parent, persistent disparagement, and failure to comply with the spirit of a parenting plan can constitute a material change in circumstances and justify modification. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

14. In evaluating the best interests of the children, the Court considers, among other factors, each parent’s willingness and ability to foster a positive relationship between the children and the other parent, the children’s emotional well-being, stability, the level of parental conflict, and the parties’ ability to communicate and cooperate in child-related matters. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

15. Since the entry of the Original Custody Order on June 15, 2021, there have been material and substantial changes in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children.

16. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly and unilaterally enrolled the minor children in extracurricular activities and events scheduled during the Plaintiff’s court-ordered parenting time, including weekends that are allocated to the Plaintiff under the Parenting Schedule.

17. The Defendant has done so without first consulting with the Plaintiff, without attempting to obtain her agreement, and without reasonably accommodating the existing Parenting Schedule.

18. The Defendant has then told the minor children, in substance, that if they do not attend those activities during the Plaintiff’s weekends, it is the Plaintiff’s “fault,” thereby placing responsibility for the children’s disappointment or perceived loss of opportunity directly on the Plaintiff.

19. The Defendant’s conduct has the effect of (a) undermining the Parenting Schedule ordered by the Court, (b) interfering with the Plaintiff’s ability to enjoy meaningful and consistent parenting time, and (c) placing the children in the middle of parental conflict.

20. The minor children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant calls the Plaintiff “selfish” and says that the Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” or words to that effect when the Plaintiff requests to swap weekends or to adjust scheduling in order to maintain her court-ordered time with the children.

21. These statements by the Defendant to the minor children are disparaging, undermine the Plaintiff’s relationship with the children, and are directly contrary to the requirements and intent of the Original Custody Order that each parent support the children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparagement.

22. The Defendant’s repeated disparagement and blame-shifting to the Plaintiff has caused emotional distress and confusion for the minor children and has increased anxiety surrounding transitions between households.

23. One of the minor children has begun experiencing physical symptoms of stress, including stomach aches on or around transition days between households, which the Plaintiff reasonably believes are related to the ongoing conflict, disparagement, and pressure the children experience around scheduling and loyalty between parents.

24. The pattern of unilateral decision-making by the Defendant concerning major aspects of the children’s lives—specifically, scheduling recurring activities that interfere with court-ordered parenting time—constitutes a failure to exercise joint legal custody in a cooperative manner and reflects a breakdown in the joint legal custody arrangement as contemplated by G.L. c. 208, § 31 and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

25. The Defendant’s conduct demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to place the children’s need for stability and healthy relationships with both parents above his own interests or preferences, which is contrary to the best interests of the children. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

26. The ongoing pattern of (a) unilateral scheduling of activities in conflict with the Plaintiff’s time, (b) failure to meaningfully confer about important child-related decisions, and (c) disparaging the Plaintiff to the children has created significant tension and conflict around the exercise of parenting time and has made the current custodial arrangement unworkable and detrimental to the children’s emotional well‑being.

27. These developments constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Original Custody Order and warrant modification of the existing custody and parenting provisions to promote the stability, emotional health, and best interests of the minor children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (2004); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE MINOR CHILDREN

28. It is in the best interests of the minor children that there be clear, workable rules regarding scheduling of extracurricular and other activities that do not routinely conflict with the Plaintiff’s parenting time, absent mutual written agreement or further order of the Court.

29. It is in the children’s best interests that each parent be explicitly required to refrain from disparaging the other parent and from blaming the other parent for reasonable requests to enforce or adjust Court‑ordered parenting time, so that the children are not placed in the middle of parental conflict.

30. It is in the children’s best interests that their primary residence continue with the Plaintiff, who has historically provided the day‑to‑day care, structure, and consistency, but that the existing order be modified to ensure that the Defendant’s parenting time and decision-making are exercised in a way that does not undermine the children’s emotional stability or their relationship with the Plaintiff. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

31. A modified parenting plan and custody provisions that (a) clarify residential responsibility, (b) preserve and appropriately structure the Defendant’s parenting time, and (c) delineate decision‑making expectations and limitations will reduce conflict, protect the children’s emotional well‑being, and further their best interests consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the guiding principles set forth in *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

32. The requested modification is not sought to interfere with the Defendant’s relationship with the children, but rather to ensure that each parent’s conduct supports the children’s ongoing relationships with both parents and provides them with a stable, predictable, and emotionally safe environment.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court, after notice and hearing, enter an Order modifying the existing Judgment and/or Original Custody Order of June 15, 2021, as follows:

A. **Custody**

1. That the Court confirm that the minor children shall continue to reside primarily with the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, as their primary residential parent.

2. That, to the extent the Court finds that the current joint legal custody arrangement has become unworkable or contrary to the children’s best interests due to the Defendant’s conduct, the Court modify legal custody to provide that:

   a. The Plaintiff shall have final decision-making authority with respect to the children’s extracurricular and scheduling matters when the parties are unable to agree after good‑faith consultation; and/or  

   b. In the alternative, or in addition, the Court issue such further orders regarding legal custody as are necessary to ensure that major decisions are made in a manner consistent with the children’s best interests and to reduce conflict.

B. **Parenting Time and Scheduling**

3. That the Court reaffirm or adjust the Parenting Schedule so that the Defendant has parenting time on specific, clearly defined days and times, which shall be set forth in the modified order.

4. That the Court order that neither parent shall unilaterally enroll the children in ongoing extracurricular activities, lessons, or other recurring commitments that are scheduled during the other parent’s court‑ordered parenting time without the other parent’s written consent or a further order of the Court.

5. That the Court order that, absent written agreement of both parents or further order of the Court, the Plaintiff’s parenting time shall not be routinely curtailed or overridden by activities unilaterally scheduled during her time.

6. That the Court order that reasonable, child‑centered adjustments to the schedule may be made by mutual written agreement between the parents, but that either parent may insist on adherence to the Court‑ordered schedule without being blamed or disparaged in front of the children.

C. **Non‑Disparagement and Support of Parent–Child Relationships**

7. That the Court enter a clear, enforceable non‑disparagement provision, ordering that neither parent shall directly or indirectly disparage, demean, or speak negatively about the other parent in the presence or hearing of the children, including but not limited to statements implying that the other parent is “selfish,” does not love the children, or is responsible for the loss of opportunities due to asserting his or her court‑ordered parenting time.

8. That the Court order each parent to actively support and encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent and to refrain from making comments that pressure the children to choose sides or feel guilty for spending time with either parent.

D. **Communication and Decision‑Making**

9. That the Court order that the parents communicate in a business‑like and respectful manner regarding the children’s schedules, education, health, and activities, and that they confer in advance in good faith before making significant changes or commitments that affect the other parent’s time.

10. That the Court order that all non‑emergency communications regarding activities and schedule changes be in writing (such as e‑mail or text) so that there is a clear record of agreements and proposed changes.

E. **General Relief**

11. That the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Original Custody Order and that the requested modifications are necessary and appropriate to promote the best interests of the minor children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and relevant case law, including but not limited to *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

12. That the Court incorporate its modified custody and parenting orders into a new Judgment of Modification.
