COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Johnson”), for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas Roberts (“Defendant” or “Mr. Roberts”), states as follows:

                                I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff regularly walked along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Thomas Roberts is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts 01201, and at all relevant times was the owner, possessor, and/or person in control of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, including the trees, branches, and vegetation adjacent to and overhanging the public sidewalk.

                         II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action sounding in negligence seeking monetary damages well in excess of $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, which confers original jurisdiction on the Superior Court over civil actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and § 3 because the cause of action arose in Berkshire County, the Defendant resides in Berkshire County, and the subject premises are located at 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

6. At all times material hereto, Defendant owed duties of reasonable care under Massachusetts common law to persons lawfully using the public sidewalk abutting his property, including Plaintiff.

                         III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. Defendant is, and at all times material hereto was, the owner, occupier, and/or person in control of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA (the “Property”).

8. In front of the Property, near and/or on the Defendant’s land, there was a large, mature maple tree (the “Tree”), with significant branches extending over and above the public sidewalk that runs along Maple Street.

9. For a substantial period of time prior to July 15, 2023, one major branch of the Tree that extended over the public sidewalk (the “Defective Branch”) appeared cracked, drooping, and visibly compromised.

10. The Defective Branch was visibly sagging and cracked to a layperson and appeared to be at risk of breaking off and falling onto the sidewalk beneath, where pedestrians regularly walked.

11. Plaintiff frequently walked along the public sidewalk on Maple Street in front of the Property and had personally observed that the Defective Branch looked cracked, droopy, and unsafe for some time prior to July 15, 2023.

12. Neighbors of Defendant, who likewise used the sidewalk and observed the condition of the Tree and the Defective Branch, commented to Plaintiff that they had mentioned the condition to Defendant and suggested that he have the Tree and Defective Branch inspected by an arborist or otherwise addressed to prevent it from falling.

13. Upon information and belief, Defendant was directly notified by one or more neighbors, prior to July 15, 2023, that the Defective Branch appeared dangerous and that he should have it inspected and/or removed.

14. Upon information and belief, Defendant responded to such concerns by indicating that he would “deal with it in the spring” or words to that effect, thereby acknowledging that he was aware of the potential problem and that he intended to address it at a later time.

15. Despite this actual notice, and despite the obvious and visible nature of the Defective Branch’s dangerous condition, Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to inspect, trim, brace, or remove the Defective Branch or otherwise mitigate the danger it posed to pedestrians using the public sidewalk, including Plaintiff.

16. Defendant had ample opportunity, over a significant period of time, to have the Defective Branch inspected and, if necessary, removed by a qualified arborist or tree service.

17. On July 15, 2023, at or about midday, during a typical summer thunderstorm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was lawfully walking along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, returning home from the grocery store and carrying grocery bags.

18. The weather at the time consisted of an ordinary summer thunderstorm, with rain and wind that were not extreme, and no tornado warnings or extraordinary weather events were present or forecast.

19. As Plaintiff walked on the sidewalk directly beneath the Defective Branch, the Defective Branch suddenly snapped and fell from the Tree, striking Plaintiff on or about her right shoulder and back and knocking her to the ground.

20. Plaintiff had no warning that the Defective Branch was about to fall, and she had no opportunity to avoid or escape from the falling branch.

21. Plaintiff did nothing to cause or contribute to the fall of the Defective Branch; she was using the sidewalk in a normal, lawful, and foreseeable manner, as a pedestrian.

22. As a direct and proximate result of being struck by the Defective Branch, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain and extensive bruising to her shoulder, back, and other parts of her body.

23. Plaintiff sought and received medical care and treatment for her injuries, including but not limited to emergency or urgent care evaluation, diagnostic testing, follow-up medical visits, and conservative treatment for her shoulder strain and bruising.

24. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses to diagnose, evaluate, and treat her injuries.

25. As a direct consequence of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week at her retail job, resulting in lost wages of approximately $600.

26. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and discomfort, particularly in and around her shoulder and back, as well as limitations in the normal use of her shoulder and back, and has suffered and may continue to suffer physical pain, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life.

27. Plaintiff has suffered, and will in the future suffer, conscious pain and suffering, emotional distress, and limitation of activities of daily living as a result of the incident described above.

28. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused by the negligence of Defendant in failing to reasonably inspect, maintain, and make safe the Tree and the Defective Branch, which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known presented a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm to persons using the adjacent public sidewalk.

29. The incident and injuries suffered by Plaintiff were reasonably foreseeable and were the natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in addressing the obviously compromised and hazardous condition of the Defective Branch.

30. No extraordinary or “Act of God” conditions were present on July 15, 2023; rather, an ordinary New England summer thunderstorm occurred, which was precisely the type of foreseeable weather event that rendered the Defective Branch especially dangerous if not properly inspected and remedied.

31. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of injury and did not engage in any comparative negligence; she simply used the public sidewalk in a normal, prudent, and lawful manner.

32. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain the Property, including trees and branches overhanging the public way, in a condition that did not unreasonably endanger lawful users of the adjacent public sidewalk.

33. Defendant breached that duty by failing to timely and reasonably address the known hazardous condition of the Defective Branch and by failing to warn pedestrians, including Plaintiff, of the danger.

                              IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                             NEGLIGENCE (COMMON LAW)

34. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth herein.

DUTY

35. Under Massachusetts common law, a property owner or person in control of premises abutting a public way owes a duty to exercise reasonable care so as not to cause or allow foreseeable and unreasonable risks of harm to persons lawfully using the public way. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (abolishing common-law distinctions between invitees and licensees and imposing a general duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995) (landowner must act reasonably to prevent foreseeable harm to others).

36. This duty extends to hazardous conditions on the premises, including trees or branches that, by reason of their condition and proximity, pose a foreseeable risk of falling into an adjacent public way and injuring passersby. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 364 (1965) (liability for artificial conditions on land near highway); accord Michalski v. Hinz, 469 Mass. 503, 507–09 (2014) (recognizing landowner duty to address conditions posing reasonably foreseeable risks).

37. A landowner is required to act with the care of a reasonably prudent person in like circumstances to inspect for, discover, and remedy dangerous conditions of which the landowner knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should know. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154 (2013); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010) (landowner liability where failure to use reasonable care to maintain property causes injury).

38. Where a hazardous condition, including a dangerous tree or branch, is open, obvious, longstanding, or the subject of specific complaints, a landowner is charged with actual or constructive notice of the condition and must take reasonable steps to inspect and correct the hazard. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (notice inferred from nature and duration of defect); Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 265 (1961).

BREACH

39. Defendant had actual notice of the hazardous condition of the Defective Branch, as neighbors directly informed him and he acknowledged that he would take action at a later time, thereby confirming awareness of the issue.

40. Even absent direct complaints, the cracked, drooping, and obviously compromised condition of the Defective Branch over a period of time gave rise to constructive notice: a reasonable landowner in Defendant’s position would have recognized the risk and taken remedial action. See Oliveri, 363 Mass. at 167–68; Thurlow v. Shaw’s Supermkts., Inc., 49 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 177–78 (2000).

41. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to reasonably inspect the Tree and Defective Branch despite clear visual signs of deterioration and hazard;

   b. Failing to consult with or retain a qualified arborist or tree professional to assess the safety of the Tree and Defective Branch once concerns were raised;

   c. Failing to trim, brace, or remove the Defective Branch despite knowledge of its compromised condition and the foreseeable risk that it would fall onto the sidewalk below;

   d. Failing to warn or protect pedestrians using the public sidewalk, such as by posting warnings, erecting temporary barriers, or otherwise alerting members of the public to the danger;

   e. Failing to act within a reasonable time after receiving actual notice of the condition and promising to “deal with it in the spring,” but then failing to do so.

42. Defendant’s inaction in the face of actual and constructive notice of an obvious hazard constitutes a breach of the duty of care imposed by Massachusetts law. See Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 372–73; Fiorentino v. Mason, 233 Mass. 451, 452–53 (1919) (liability where landowner’s failure to remove dangerous condition caused foreseeable harm).

CAUSATION

43. But for Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, and remove the Defective Branch, the branch would not have fallen on July 15, 2023, and Plaintiff would not have been struck and injured.

44. The ordinary summer thunderstorm that occurred on July 15, 2023, was a foreseeable weather event in Massachusetts and was precisely the type of condition that made a visibly cracked and drooping branch especially likely to fail. Defendant was obligated to anticipate such routine weather and to take reasonable steps in advance to prevent foreseeable harm. See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–07 (1978) (defendant liable where negligent failure to address foreseeable danger leads to injury).

45. The harm suffered by Plaintiff—being struck and injured by a falling tree branch while walking on the adjacent public sidewalk—was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to act, and there were no superseding or intervening causes that would break the chain of causation. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002) (foreseeability and proximate cause).

46. Defendant’s negligence need not be the sole cause of Plaintiff’s injuries; it is sufficient that Defendant’s conduct was a substantial contributing factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s injuries. See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 58–61 (1983).

DAMAGES

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including but not limited to a shoulder strain and extensive bruising.

48. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately $2,500 for evaluation and treatment of her injuries, and such expenses were the natural and probable consequence of the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence. See G.L. c. 231, § 60F (addressing proof of medical expenses as evidence of fair and reasonable charge).

49. Plaintiff lost approximately $600 in wages from her retail employment as a direct result of her inability to work for about one week following the incident.

50. Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence. See Haddad v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (No. 1), 455 Mass. 91, 100–01 (2009) (recognizing recovery for pain and suffering and other noneconomic damages).

51. Plaintiff has suffered impairment of her normal activities and will likely continue to experience limitations in the normal use of her shoulder and back, including difficulty performing work, household tasks, and recreational activities.

52. Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages proximately caused by his negligence, including but not limited to:

   a. Past and future medical expenses;

   b. Past and future lost earnings and/or impairment of earning capacity;

   c. Past and future pain and suffering;

   d. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life;

   e. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and

   f. Costs of this action.

53. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to statutory prejudgment interest on any judgment for personal injuries from the date of commencement of this action.

54. To the extent applicable, any defense of “natural accumulation” or “Act of God” is inapplicable here because the risk stemmed from Defendant’s long-standing failure to address a visibly compromised branch and an ordinary storm, not an extraordinary unforeseeable event. See Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 372–77 (rejecting arbitrary distinctions where landowner’s negligence is cause of injury).

55. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 and applicable Massachusetts law.

                          V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Roberts and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to exceed the minimum jurisdictional amount of this Court, for:

   1. Past and future medical expenses, presently estimated at no less than $2,500, plus additional amounts as proven at trial;

   2. Past and future lost wages and/or impairment of earning capacity, presently estimated at no less than $600 in past lost wages, plus additional amounts as proven at trial;

   3. Past and future pain and suffering;

   4. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Prejudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B and any other applicable statute;

                           VI. JURY DEMAND
