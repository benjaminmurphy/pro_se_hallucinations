Lisa McKenzie,  
   Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                    Docket No. __________  

Mark Johnson,  
   Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa McKenzie (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa McKenzie, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children Emma Johnson and Noah Johnson.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children Emma Johnson and Noah Johnson.

3. The parties are the parents of:
   - Emma Johnson, date of birth: __________, age 8; and  
   - Noah Johnson, date of birth: __________, age 6  
   (collectively, the “Children”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This matter is properly before the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6, and G.L. c. 208, § 28 (if a divorce matter) and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (if a non‑marital parentage matter), which authorize the Court to make and modify orders relative to custody and parenting time of minor children.

5. Venue is proper in the Somerville Probate and Family Court, Middlesex Division, because the original custody and parenting-time judgment/order was entered in this Court on or about May 15, 2020, and the Children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 215, § 3.

6. The Court retains continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time orders for the Children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 259–60 (2001).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / CURRENT ORDER

7. On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a judgment/order (the “2020 Custody Order”) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the Children.

8. Under the 2020 Custody Order, Mother has primary physical custody of the Children. Father was granted parenting time consisting of:
   a. Every other weekend parenting time; and  
   b. One overnight during the week on a regular weekday.

9. The 2020 Custody Order was based on the parties’ circumstances at that time, including that both parties worked regular daytime schedules and were generally available to care for the Children during their respective parenting time, particularly during overnight periods.

10. At the time the 2020 Custody Order entered, the Court determined that the schedule set forth therein was in the best interests of the Children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 10, as interpreted by cases such as Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), and Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

11. Since entry of the 2020 Custody Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the Children and the parenting schedule, warranting modification of the order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and related case law. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981).

12. Specifically, Father has recently taken a new job that requires him to work overnight shifts, from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights during which he is scheduled under the 2020 Custody Order to have the Children overnight.

13. Father’s overnight work schedule did not exist and was not anticipated at the time of the 2020 Custody Order. This change in Father’s employment schedule is substantial and permanent or indefinite, not temporary, and directly interferes with his ability to exercise overnight parenting time in a manner that is safe, consistent, and in the Children’s best interests. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 259–61; Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871–73 (2006).

14. Due to his overnight work schedule, Father has repeatedly been unable to care for the Children during his scheduled overnight parenting time. On numerous occasions, often with very little notice, Father has:
   a. Dropped the Children off at Mother’s home shortly before or during his scheduled parenting time, stating that he is too tired to care for them after his shift; and/or  
   b. Left the Children in the care of his roommate—an individual with whom Mother has little to no relationship and about whom she has limited information.

15. The Children have reported to Mother that when they are with Father during his work weeks:
   a. They frequently fall asleep on the couch;  
   b. Father often needs to nap after getting home from work and is not consistently awake and attentive to them; and  
   c. There are times when they are primarily supervised by Father’s roommate rather than by Father himself.

16. The pattern of Father’s last‑minute drop‑offs, inconsistent availability, and reliance on a third party for supervision during his scheduled overnights creates instability, disrupts the Children’s routines, and undermines the predictability and structure that are essential to their well‑being. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (stability and continuity are important factors in custody determinations).

17. The overnight parenting schedule crafted in 2020 assumed that both parents would be personally available and awake during their parenting time, particularly overnight. Father’s new schedule means he is frequently either at work during his scheduled overnights or attempting to sleep immediately after work, leading to diminished supervision and care.

18. Father’s consistent inability to exercise overnight parenting time as originally ordered, and his shift‑work schedule that is incompatible with regular overnights, constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2020 Custody Order. See, e.g., M.P.M. v. V.M., 72 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 800–01 (2008); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–39 (1996).

19. This change is of such a nature that modification of the existing parenting-time schedule is now necessary to serve the best interests of the Children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 544–45 (2010).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

20. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time decision is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998).

21. The Children are now school‑aged (8 and 6) and require consistent routines, adequate sleep, safe and appropriate supervision, and a stable home environment. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996) (court may consider child’s age, needs, and stability); Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05.

22. Father’s overnight employment, and the resulting irregular care arrangements, adversely affect the Children’s stability and routine, particularly:
   a. Bedtime and wake‑up routines are inconsistent;  
   b. The Children sometimes fall asleep on the couch rather than in proper beds;  
   c. The primary caregiver during some overnights is Father’s roommate instead of a parent; and  
   d. The Children experience uncertainty about whether they will remain with Father or be returned to Mother at the last minute.

23. Mother has primary physical custody and is consistently available during the evenings and overnight to provide direct, personal care for the Children. Adjusting the parenting schedule so that overnights occur only when Father is actually off work and available will better protect the Children’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs. See Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610, 619–20 (1986) (court must consider capacity of parent to provide for child’s needs).

24. The requested modification does not seek to reduce or eliminate Father’s relationship with the Children; rather, it is designed to align overnight parenting time with Father’s actual availability, to ensure that:
   a. The Children are with a parent, not a third party, during overnight periods whenever possible; and  
   b. Parenting time is exercised in a manner consistent with their best interests, safety, and stability.

25. Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that when a prior custody/parenting judgment has become incompatible with the child’s welfare due to changed circumstances, the Court has both the power and the duty to modify that judgment. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 259–61; Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 899–900.

26. Continuing to enforce the 2020 Custody Order’s overnight parenting schedule, without modification to account for Father’s overnight employment and resulting unavailability, is no longer in the Children’s best interests and places them at risk of inadequate supervision and disrupted routines.

27. A revised parenting-time order that limits or restructures overnight contact to nights when Father is not working, and when he is actually available and able to care for the Children, is necessary and appropriate and serves the Children’s best interests under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

28. Mother requests that the Court find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the 2020 Custody Order, namely Father’s new overnight work schedule and resulting unavailability and inconsistent supervision during his scheduled overnight parenting time.

29. Mother further requests that the Court find that modification of the existing parenting-time order is necessary to protect and promote the best interests of the Children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590; and related authorities.

30. Specifically, Mother respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Maintain Mother as the primary physical custodian of the Children, with the existing allocation of legal custody (joint or sole, as previously ordered) to remain in effect unless otherwise determined by the Court;

   b. Modify Father’s parenting time so that:
      i. Father’s overnights with the Children occur only on nights when Father is not scheduled to work an overnight (e.g., 7:00 p.m. – 7:00 a.m.) shift, and when he is reasonably rested and personally available to supervise and care for the Children;  
      ii. On any week in which Father is scheduled to work overnight shifts, the weekday overnight parenting time shall be converted to non‑overnight parenting time (for example, after‑school or early evening visits) or rescheduled to another time when Father is off‑duty and available;  
      iii. Father shall provide Mother with reasonable advance written notice (for example, by text or email) of his overnight work schedule, including any changes, so that both parties and the Children can plan accordingly; and  
      iv. To the extent the Court deems appropriate, Father’s reliance on unrelated third parties (including but not limited to roommates) as primary overnight caregivers during his parenting time shall be limited or prohibited, such that overnights occur when Father himself is able to provide care.

   c. Clarify that, in the event Father is unable to exercise a scheduled overnight parenting time due to work or exhaustion, the Children shall be with Mother, and such missed overnights may be made up at reasonable, mutually agreed‑upon times when Father is off work and available, subject to the Children’s school and activity schedules and their best interests;

   d. Order any further adjustments to the detailed parenting schedule (weekends, holidays, school vacations, and summers) as may be necessary to align Father’s overnights and extended time with his non‑work periods, while preserving meaningful contact between Father and the Children;

   e. Order that each party shall make reasonable, good‑faith efforts to communicate about scheduling and the Children’s needs, and to implement the modified order in a way that minimizes disruption for the Children;

   f. Enter any additional or alternative orders the Court deems just and proper to ensure that the parenting schedule reflects the current realities of Father’s work schedule and the Children’s best interests.

### VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa McKenzie, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2020 Custody Order, based on Father’s overnight employment and resulting unavailability during his scheduled overnight parenting time;

B. Find that the existing overnight parenting-time provisions of the 2020 Custody Order are no longer in the best interests of the minor Children;

C. Modify the existing custody/parenting-time order to:
   1. Maintain Mother as the primary physical custodian of the Children;  
   2. Limit and restructure Father’s overnight parenting time so that overnights occur only on nights when Father is not working overnight and is personally available and able to care for the Children;  
   3. Convert or reschedule weekday overnights that conflict with Father’s overnight work shifts into non‑overnight parenting time or to other times when Father is off work and available, in a manner consistent with the Children’s best interests; and  
   4. Provide any other specific scheduling provisions necessary to ensure the Children’s stability, safety, and routine;

D. Order that each party facilitate the other’s reasonable and appropriate parenting time and communication with the Children, consistent with their best interests;

E. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor Children.

Respectfully submitted,  

Plaintiff,  
Lisa McKenzie,  
Pro Se
