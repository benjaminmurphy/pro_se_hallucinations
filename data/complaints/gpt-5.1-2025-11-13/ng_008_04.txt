CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED  

------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff, Jessica Hartman (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Quincy Bistro LLC (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman (“Hartman”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC (“Quincy Bistro” or “Defendant”) is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls a restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts 02169 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant, by and through its officers, employees, agents, and/or servants, operated the Premises as a restaurant open to the general public, including Plaintiff, and invited members of the public to enter and remain on the Premises as paying customers.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and/or regularly conducts business within Massachusetts, including operating the restaurant at issue in Quincy, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3(a).

7. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and/or related venue provisions, because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County, at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about September 10, 2023, Plaintiff was a paying customer and lawful business invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant, by and through its employees, servants, and/or agents (collectively, “staff”), owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a business invitee, to use reasonable care to keep the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any unreasonable dangers of which Defendant knew or should have known. See, e.g., *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 336–37 (2010).

10. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was seated in the dining area of the restaurant.

11. A narrow hallway connected the kitchen and the dining room and served as a pathway to, among other things, the restrooms used by customers.

12. On or about the evening of September 10, 2023, while Plaintiff was dining, one of Defendant’s servers dropped a tray containing several water glasses in this narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room (the “Hallway”).

13. The dropped tray caused multiple glasses to break and caused water and ice to spill onto the tile floor in the Hallway.

14. The server quickly picked up and removed the broken glass from the Hallway.

15. The server, however, left the water and ice on the tile floor without promptly cleaning or drying the area.

16. The server, in Plaintiff’s presence and/or within Plaintiff’s hearing, stated that she would “be right back with a mop” or words to that effect.

17. The server did not, at that time or any time before Plaintiff’s fall, place any “wet floor” sign, cone, barrier, or other warning device in or near the Hallway.

18. The server did not verbally warn Plaintiff or other customers that the Hallway floor was dangerously wet and slippery.

19. Approximately ten (10) minutes after the tray was dropped and the water and ice spilled, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom.

20. To reach the restroom, Plaintiff was required to walk through the Hallway where the spill had occurred.

21. At that time, the water and ice remained on the tile floor; no one had mopped, dried, or otherwise remediated the hazard.

22. The Hallway remained wet and slippery despite the server’s earlier statement that she would be right back with a mop.

23. As Plaintiff approached the Hallway, she could see what appeared to be a sheen or glistening on the tile floor but reasonably believed it to be a normal, shiny tile surface, not an unreasonably dangerous accumulation of water and ice.

24. Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety as she walked toward and into the Hallway to use the restroom.

25. Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, the glistening she observed was in fact water and ice that had been left on the tile floor by Defendant’s staff.

26. As Plaintiff stepped onto the wet area of the Hallway floor, her foot slipped out from under her due to the presence of the water and/or ice.

27. Plaintiff fell and twisted her knee violently in the process (the “Incident”).

28. Immediately after the Incident, Plaintiff experienced significant pain in her knee and difficulty bearing weight.

29. Following the Incident, Plaintiff overheard one or more of Defendant’s staff members remark, in substance, that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

30. The staff member’s statement indicates that the puddle of water and ice had existed for a sufficient period of time before Plaintiff’s fall for staff to have noticed it, to have appreciated its danger, and to have had an opportunity to address it.

31. Defendant, acting by and through its employees, had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition, as the server both caused and observed the spill and acknowledged the need for a mop.

32. Alternatively, and/or in addition, the hazardous condition existed for such a length of time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it, thereby establishing constructive notice. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973); *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

33. At no time before Plaintiff’s fall did Defendant or its staff adequately warn Plaintiff, by sign, barrier, or verbal communication, of the wet and slippery condition in the Hallway.

34. At no time before Plaintiff’s fall did Defendant or its staff adequately clean, mop, dry, cordon off, or otherwise remedy the hazardous condition in the Hallway.

35. Plaintiff’s fall and injuries were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the presence of water and ice on the tile floor, in a narrow, heavily trafficked Hallway, without remedial measures or warnings.

---

### IV. INJURIES AND DAMAGES

36. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered a sprained knee and associated soft-tissue injuries.

37. Plaintiff required medical evaluation and treatment, including urgent care services shortly after the Incident.

38. Plaintiff’s knee injury required the use of a knee brace.

39. Plaintiff underwent a course of physical therapy over a period of weeks following the Incident.

40. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses as a result of the Incident in an approximate amount of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00).

41. Plaintiff missed work and lost wages in an approximate amount of One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) due to her injuries and the resulting limitations.

42. Plaintiff experienced pain, suffering, and discomfort in her knee, as well as temporary loss of mobility and difficulty with activities of daily living.

43. Plaintiff has suffered and may continue to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the Incident.

44. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable to Defendant as a natural and probable consequence of leaving water and ice on a tile floor in a pedestrian pathway without timely cleanup or warning.

---

### V. APPLICABLE LAW

45. Under Massachusetts law, owners and operators of premises open to the public owe all lawful visitors a duty “to act as a reasonable person in maintaining his property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances.” *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973).

46. This duty of reasonable care includes the obligation to:  
   a. Use reasonable care to discover conditions that create an unreasonable risk of harm;  
   b. Make such conditions reasonably safe; and/or  
   c. Adequately warn invitees of such conditions. See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995); *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837, 842 (1987).

47. A business owner is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition on its premises where it:  
   a. Created the condition;  
   b. Had actual knowledge of the condition; or  
   c. Had constructive knowledge because the condition existed for such a length of time that, in the exercise of reasonable care, it should have been discovered and remedied. See *Oliveri v. MBTA*, 363 Mass. at 167–68; *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. at 264–65; *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560, 562 (1955).

48. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized that slippery floors, including those made wet by water or other substances, can constitute an unreasonably dangerous condition when not properly addressed by the property owner. See, e.g., *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378–80 (2010) (reaffirming duty to maintain reasonably safe conditions with respect to slippery surfaces); *Bowers v. P. Wile’s, Inc.*, 454 Mass. 361, 365–66 (2009).

49. As of *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), Massachusetts applies a unified standard of reasonable care for all hazards of which a property owner knows or reasonably should know, whether natural or unnatural, including slippery surfaces in common areas.

50. Under G.L. c. 231, § 60B and related statutes, negligence claims for bodily injury must be evaluated under traditional tort principles, including duty, breach, causation, and damages, all of which are present here.

51. Comparative negligence, if any, on the part of Plaintiff is governed by G.L. c. 231, § 85, which provides that a plaintiff may recover so long as her negligence, if any, is not greater than the total negligence of the defendant and that damages shall be diminished in proportion to the plaintiff’s negligence. See *Zeroulias v. City of Salem*, 384 Mass. 800, 803–04 (1981).

---

### VI. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

52. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 51 as if fully set forth herein.

53. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on Defendant’s Premises.

54. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, maintenance, and control of the Premises, including the Hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, to keep it in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any unreasonably dangerous conditions of which it knew or should have known. See *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 708; *Davis*, 420 Mass. at 743–44.

55. Defendant, acting by and through its employees and agents, breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. By causing or allowing water and ice to remain on the tile floor in the Hallway, creating a slippery, hazardous condition;

   b. By failing to promptly clean, mop, dry, or otherwise remove the water and ice from the Hallway after the server dropped the tray and created the spill;

   c. By failing to inspect and monitor the Hallway within a reasonable time after the spill, despite actual and/or constructive knowledge of the hazard;

   d. By failing to place any warning signs, cones, barriers, or other visible indicators to alert customers, including Plaintiff, to the existence of the wet and slippery floor in the Hallway;

   e. By failing to verbally warn Plaintiff and other customers known to be using or likely to use the Hallway that the floor was wet and slippery;

   f. By permitting the Hallway, a narrow and heavily traveled passageway to the restrooms, to remain in a dangerous condition for at least ten (10) minutes after the spill, notwithstanding staff’s stated intention to retrieve a mop;

   g. By failing to adopt, implement, and/or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the prompt clean-up of spills and the posting of warnings regarding slippery floors in customer walkways;

   h. By failing to properly train and supervise its employees regarding the inspection and maintenance of the floors and the prompt remediation of known hazards;

   i. By failing to act as a reasonably prudent restaurant owner/operator would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

56. Defendant had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition because its employee created, observed, and acknowledged the spill and the need for clean-up, and additional employees later acknowledged they had been “dodging that puddle.”

57. Alternatively, and/or in addition, the hazardous condition existed long enough for Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, to have discovered and remedied it before Plaintiff’s fall, thereby giving Defendant constructive notice of the condition. See *Oliveri*, 363 Mass. at 167–68; *Deagle*, 343 Mass. at 264–65.

58. The foreseeability of harm from leaving water and ice on a tile floor in a narrow Hallway used by customers is obvious and well established under Massachusetts premises liability law. See, e.g., *Bowers*, 454 Mass. at 365–66.

59. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as described above, constitute a breach of its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff and were negligent under Massachusetts law.

60. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries, in that but for Defendant’s failure to properly address and warn of the hazard, Plaintiff would not have slipped, fallen, and suffered her injuries.

61. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the physical injuries and economic and non-economic damages described above, including but not limited to:

   a. Bodily injury to her knee and associated structures;

   b. Pain and suffering;

   c. Lost wages and diminished earning capacity, now and in the future, to the extent proven;

   d. Past and future medical expenses, including evaluation, treatment, physical therapy, and any reasonably necessary future care;

   e. Loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and emotional distress reasonably flowing from the physical injury.

62. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligence, and any alleged open and obvious nature of the condition does not relieve Defendant of its duty where, as here, it should have anticipated that lawful visitors would use the Hallway and could be harmed if reasonable steps were not taken to remedy the hazard or provide adequate warning. See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 156–57 (2013); *Soederberg*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. at 337–38.

63. To the extent Defendant contends that Plaintiff was negligent, such negligence, if any, was less than the negligence of Defendant and merely serves, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, to diminish but not bar Plaintiff’s recovery.

64. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with interest and costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B and other applicable law.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

65. Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable statutes, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---
