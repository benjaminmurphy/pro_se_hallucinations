This is a classic articulation of the \u201cegg-shell plaintiff\u201d / \u201ctake the plaintiff as you find him\u201d doctrine: the defendant is liable for all consequences where his negligence lowers the victim\u2019s vitality and thereby leads to greater or different injury than would occur in a healthier person. Thus it directly supports the proposition that a Massachusetts tortfeasor must answer for all damages proximately caused, even where special susceptibility is involved.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIt is settled that, where an injury arising from a cause which entails liability on the defendant combines with a preexisting or a subsequently acquired disease to bring about greater harm to the plaintiff than would have resulted from the injury alone, the defendant may be liable for all the consequences. \u2026 The result follows that, if any injury progressively so reduces the general vitality of the person injured as to make him peculiarly susceptible to a disease which is contracted, the chain of causation is not thereby broken as matter of law.\u201d"
