Docket No. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28; ch. 209C, § 20)  
---------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered on October 15, 2019, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Carter (DOB: __________), age 8.

2. The Defendant, James Carter (“Father”), is an individual and the father of the minor child, Sophie Carter. Upon information and belief, Father now resides on Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the minor child’s primary residence and school.

3. The minor child, Sophie Carter, resides primarily with Mother, pursuant to the existing custody and parenting time order of this Court dated October 15, 2019 (the “2019 Order”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify orders regarding custody and parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.

5. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the prior custody and parenting time order was entered in this division, the child resides within the jurisdiction of this Court, and the original case is pending or was adjudicated here.

### III. PRIOR ORDER

6. On or about October 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2019 Order”) awarding primary physical custody of Sophie to Mother and granting Father parenting time every other weekend, plus one midweek overnight each Wednesday.

7. At the time the 2019 Order was entered, both parties lived in the same town, and the minor child’s school was approximately a five‑minute drive from Father’s residence, such that the midweek overnight did not involve any significant travel or disruption to the child’s school schedule.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Order, Father has relocated his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles away from the child’s school and Mother’s home.

9. Despite this significant relocation and increased distance, Father has continued to insist on exercising the same Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time, without adjustment to reflect the current circumstances.

10. Under the current practice, Father picks the child up from school on Wednesdays, drives approximately ninety (90) miles to Cape Cod, and then awakens the child at or about 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings in order to drive her back the same approximate ninety (90) miles so that she arrives at school on time.

11. As a direct and proximate result of this lengthy round‑trip travel and extremely early wake‑up time on a school day, Sophie is consistently exhausted on Thursdays, has difficulty focusing, and is noticeably more tired and less engaged in her schoolwork.

12. Sophie’s teacher has informed Mother that Sophie’s participation and attention in class have declined noticeably on Thursdays, and that Sophie appears fatigued and less able to engage academically on those days, in contrast to other school days.

13. The circumstances under which the 2019 Order and its Wednesday overnight provision were originally crafted—namely, both parents living in close proximity to one another and to the child’s school—no longer exist.

14. Father’s relocation to a residence approximately ninety (90) miles away, combined with his continued insistence on the midweek overnight that now requires a late‑evening trip and a pre‑dawn departure on a school day, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s well‑being, within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28 and related case law.

15. The current midweek arrangement imposes an unreasonable burden on the minor child, interferes with her rest, and adversely affects her school performance, which was not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2019 Order.

### V. APPLICABLE LAW AND BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

16. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28, the Court may modify an existing judgment regarding custody or parenting time if “the circumstances of the parties or the child have so changed that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”

17. Similarly, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20 authorizes modification of custody and parenting time orders concerning children born out of wedlock upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the child’s best interests.

18. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that, for a modification of custody or parenting time, the moving party must demonstrate (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:  
   a. **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   b. **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   c. **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   d. **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   e. **Bouchard v. Ryan**, 429 Mass. 242 (1999);  
   f. **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406 (1976);  
   g. **Champion v. Champion**, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002);  
   h. **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981);  
   i. **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   j. **Care and Protection of Three Minors**, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).

19. In **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), the Supreme Judicial Court emphasized that stability is important, but modification is appropriate when changes in the parties’ circumstances affect the child’s welfare and best interests.

20. In **Bouchard v. Ryan**, 429 Mass. 242 (1999), the Court held that a substantial change in circumstances that bears upon the child’s welfare justifies revisiting existing custody and visitation arrangements.

21. In relocation‑related cases such as **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), the Court has recognized that significant changes in the parents’ residences and the resulting impact on the child’s daily life and welfare are central to the “best interests of the child” analysis.

22. While this Complaint does not concern a removal petition, Father’s relocation and insistence on a midweek overnight that now requires extraordinary travel time and severely disrupted sleep for the child present a comparable situation in which the Court must evaluate whether the existing schedule continues to serve the child’s best interests.

23. Massachusetts case law holds that the best interests of the child are of “paramount importance” in all custody and parenting time determinations. See **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); **Care and Protection of Three Minors**, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).

24. Factors that courts typically consider in assessing the child’s best interests include, among other things, the child’s emotional and developmental needs, the child’s educational needs and performance, the stability of the child’s environment, and the effect of the parenting plan on the child’s daily life. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

25. The current Wednesday midweek overnight arrangement undermines Sophie’s educational performance and her physical well‑being by depriving her of adequate sleep and requiring extremely long car rides both late at night and before dawn on a school day.

26. The burden placed on Sophie by the Wednesday overnight is not outweighed by any corresponding benefit to her; the same or greater quality of contact between Sophie and Father can be preserved through an adjusted schedule that concentrates Father’s parenting time on non‑school nights and weekends.

27. The requested modification does not seek to deprive Father of a meaningful relationship with Sophie or to terminate his parenting time; instead, it seeks to re‑allocate parenting time to protect Sophie’s health, rest, and academic functioning, which is consistent with the best‑interests‑of‑the‑child standard articulated in the above‑referenced cases and in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28.

28. Under these statutes and cases, the combination of (a) Father’s relocation to a residence approximately ninety (90) miles away from the child’s school, (b) the ongoing requirement that the child travel that distance twice in less than 24 hours on a school night, (c) the 4:30 a.m. wake‑up, and (d) the documented negative impact on Sophie’s school participation and fatigue on Thursdays, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that warrants modification of the existing parenting plan.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

29. Mother does not seek to alter the designation of primary physical custody, which remains with Mother as ordered in the 2019 Order, and she supports Sophie maintaining a positive and meaningful relationship with Father.

30. Mother respectfully requests that this Court eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time in light of Father’s relocation and the resulting harm to Sophie’s sleep and school performance.

31. Mother further requests that the Court adjust Father’s weekend parenting time in a manner that maintains or reasonably preserves the overall quantity of Father’s contact with Sophie while minimizing long‑distance travel on school nights.

32. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court enter an order substantially as follows (subject to any further refinement the Court may deem appropriate in the child’s best interests):

   a. Primary physical custody of Sophie shall remain with Mother, consistent with the 2019 Order.

   b. Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time shall be eliminated.

   c. Father shall continue to have parenting time on alternate weekends, but the parenting time shall occur in a manner that avoids excessively long travel on a school night. By way of example only, and without limiting the Court’s discretion, the weekend schedule may include:  
      i. Alternate weekends from Friday after school (or at a mutually agreeable time on Friday) until Sunday at a reasonable return time (e.g., 5:00 p.m. or such time as the Court determines appropriate); and  
      ii. Any additional non‑school‑night overnights or extended weekend time that the parties and the Court determine will not unduly interfere with Sophie’s rest and school obligations.

   d. The parties may, by mutual written agreement, adjust specific pick‑up and drop‑off times and locations, so long as such adjustments do not require Sophie to wake at an unreasonably early hour for school and do not cause her to arrive at school tired or late.

   e. Holidays, vacations, and special occasions may be allocated consistent with the existing 2019 Order or as the Court otherwise deems appropriate, provided that travel on the night before a school day is limited in a manner that safeguards Sophie’s sleep and readiness for school.

   f. All other provisions of the 2019 Order not inconsistent with the modified schedule shall remain in full force and effect.

33. The relief requested herein is narrowly tailored to address the material changed circumstances and the adverse impact of the current Wednesday overnight on Sophie’s well‑being and school performance, and it promotes her best interests within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, § 20, and the applicable Massachusetts case law cited above.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and determine that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the October 15, 2019 custody and parenting time order, specifically including Father’s relocation to Cape Cod approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school and the resulting detrimental impact of the current Wednesday overnight on Sophie’s rest and school performance;

B. Find and determine that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Carter, that the existing parenting time schedule be modified;

C. Issue a modified judgment or order:

   1. Confirming that primary physical custody of Sophie remains with Mother;  
   2. Eliminating Father’s Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time;  
   3. Adjusting Father’s weekend parenting time so that his contact with Sophie is concentrated on non‑school nights and weekends and does not require excessively early wake‑ups, excessive travel on school nights, or any other arrangements detrimental to Sophie’s sleep and school performance; and  
   4. Leaving all remaining provisions of the October 15, 2019 order in effect, except as specifically modified by the Court;

D. Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LAURA MITCHELL,  
By her pro se appearance,
