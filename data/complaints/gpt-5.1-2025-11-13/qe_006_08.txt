Docket No. ___________  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff Maria Lopez (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Lopez”) alleges as follows against Defendant John Harrison (“Defendant” or “Mr. Harrison”):

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maria Lopez is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant John Harrison is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the lessor, landlord, and/or person entitled to receive rent for the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000, placing this matter within the jurisdiction of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and related provisions.

6. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court because the Premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this county.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for a residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (the “Apartment” or the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment from on or about June 1, 2022, to the present.

9. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Apartment is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant has been responsible for providing and maintaining essential services in the Apartment, including hot water, in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and applicable law. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 CMR 410.000 (State Sanitary Code, Chapter II).

11. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code requires that landlords provide a supply of hot water at prescribed temperatures and maintain plumbing facilities in good working order. See 105 CMR 410.190 (Hot Water); 105 CMR 410.351, 410.750.

12. The provision of hot water is an essential service and a basic requirement of a habitable residential dwelling under Massachusetts law.

13. Approximately three weeks before the filing of this Complaint (on or about early November 2025), the hot water in Plaintiff’s Apartment ceased functioning.

14. On the same day that the hot water stopped working, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water.

15. Defendant responded that the water heater needed a part and that he had ordered it.

16. One week after Plaintiff’s initial report, there was still no hot water in the Apartment. Plaintiff contacted Defendant again.

17. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the needed part was “backordered” and that he was waiting for the supplier.

18. Another week passed with no hot water. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant, and Defendant gave substantially the same explanation: that he was “working on it” and could not make the supplier ship the part faster.

19. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water in the Apartment for approximately three weeks.

20. During this entire three‑week period, Plaintiff has had to live in the Apartment without hot water for bathing, washing dishes, and other ordinary and necessary uses.

21. Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers in her own home or to avoid showering there due to the lack of hot water.

22. Plaintiff has obtained a gym membership costing approximately $30 per month, which she would not otherwise have purchased, solely so that she can access hot showers.

23. Plaintiff must also spend money on gas to drive to and from the gym for the purpose of showering, which she would not otherwise have spent but for the loss of hot water in the Apartment.

24. Plaintiff is the parent of a baby who resides with her at the Apartment.

25. Because she cannot safely or reasonably bathe her baby in cold water, Plaintiff has been required to take the baby to her mother’s home for baths, causing additional inconvenience, burden, and expense.

26. In order to wash dishes at the Apartment, Plaintiff has been forced to boil water and carry it to the sink, which is time‑consuming, inconvenient, and unsafe, and has interfered with her normal use of the kitchen.

27. The absence of hot water for this extended period significantly interferes with the ordinary, comfortable, and safe use of the Apartment as a residence.

28. Plaintiff has remained current in the payment of rent or substantially so during this time, and Defendant has continued to accept rent for the Apartment.

29. Plaintiff has communicated repeatedly with Defendant regarding the lack of hot water, and Defendant has been aware of the issue since the first day the hot water failed.

30. Despite this knowledge and the essential nature of the service, Defendant has failed to restore hot water to the Apartment within a reasonable time.

31. Defendant’s explanations that he is “working on it” and that the part is “backordered” do not change the fact that, for approximately three weeks, an essential service has not been provided in Plaintiff’s Apartment.

32. Regardless of any claimed difficulty with suppliers, it is Defendant’s legal obligation, as landlord, to ensure that Plaintiff has hot water and that the Apartment complies with the State Sanitary Code and applicable statutes.

33. Defendant could have, but did not, take other reasonable steps to restore hot water within a reasonable time, such as replacing the water heater, using an alternative supplier, installing a temporary solution, or otherwise acting with the urgency required by the law for an essential service.

34. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to provide hot water for approximately three weeks, Plaintiff has suffered substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the Apartment, including:

   a. Inability to bathe comfortably in her own home;  
   b. Inability to safely and reasonably bathe her baby in the Apartment;  
   c. Significant inconvenience in performing basic household tasks such as washing dishes;  
   d. Emotional distress, discomfort, and humiliation associated with having to leave her home to shower and bathe her child; and  
   e. Additional out‑of‑pocket expenses, including gym membership fees and transportation costs.

35. Plaintiff estimates that she has incurred at least approximately $450 in damages as a result of Defendant’s conduct, including rent abatement for the affected period, consequential expenses, and compensation for loss of use and enjoyment.

36. The deprivation of hot water for an extended period constitutes a serious interference with the use and enjoyment of the Apartment and with Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant under Massachusetts law.

37. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water within a reasonable time after notice is a “neglect” or “omission” that leads to an interruption of services rendering the Premises unfit for human habitation or in violation of the law, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

38. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the furnishing of…hot water” and other essential services.

39. The statute provides that a landlord who violates this covenant “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

40. The covenant of quiet enjoyment in G.L. c. 186, § 14 is interpreted broadly to protect tenants from serious interferences with their tenancy, whether caused by acts or by negligent failures to act. See, e.g., **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–105 (1982).

41. A landlord’s “neglect or omission” that results in “any interruption of heat, hot water, electricity, gas, or other services” required by law or by the terms of the tenancy constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 716–718 (1977).

42. Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that “substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises” caused by the landlord’s failure to maintain essential services gives rise to liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Jablonski v. Clemons**, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 478–480 (2004).

43. The landlord’s intent to harm the tenant is not required; a negligent failure to correct conditions that seriously interfere with the tenant’s enjoyment can constitute a breach. See **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994) (landlord liability under § 14 does not require proof of malice); **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850–852 (1997).

44. The loss of hot water for an extended period, in violation of the State Sanitary Code and the implied warranty of habitability, can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (extended sanitary code violations and lack of essential services support § 14 liability); cf. **Hemingway v. City of Worcester**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 954, 955–56 (1982).

45. Massachusetts law also implies a warranty of habitability in all residential tenancies, requiring that premises be fit for human occupation and conform to the State Sanitary Code. See **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973); **McKenna v. Begin**, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 168, 173–74 (1975).

46. Although this Complaint asserts only a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, the same facts demonstrate that the Apartment, without hot water for approximately three weeks, has not complied with minimum standards of fitness and has subjected Plaintiff to substantial deprivation of the ordinary use of her home.

47. Under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A and 127H, and the State Sanitary Code, landlords are required to maintain dwelling units in compliance with health and safety regulations, including the continuous provision of hot water. Failure to do so can support findings of uninhabitability and violations of tenants’ rights.

48. The District Court and Housing Court have repeatedly found that extended deprivations of essential services, including hot water, constitute a serious interference with quiet enjoyment and warrant statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 982–83 (1982) (significant code violations and conditions interfering with use and enjoyment support § 14 recovery).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

49. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–48 as if fully set forth herein.

50. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord and person entitled to receive rent for the Apartment, owed Plaintiff a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

51. Defendant was obligated not to “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of the Premises and not to “directly or indirectly interfere with the furnishing of hot water and other essential services” to Plaintiff’s Apartment.

52. Plaintiff’s right to have hot water in her Apartment is protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14, by the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.190 and related provisions), and by the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized by Massachusetts courts.

53. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant when the hot water in the Apartment stopped functioning approximately three weeks before the filing of this Complaint.

54. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to restore hot water within a reasonable time and failed to take adequate steps to provide Plaintiff with this essential service.

55. Defendant’s failure to maintain and restore hot water constitutes a “neglect” or “omission” that resulted in an “interruption of…hot water” and rendered the Premises in violation of law and substantially unfit for human habitation within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

56. The lack of hot water for approximately three weeks is a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment, as it prevents or severely burdens basic daily activities including bathing, cleaning, and caring for her child.

57. Defendant’s conduct, whether intentional, reckless, or negligent, is sufficient to establish liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14, as the statute encompasses indirect interference and neglect leading to an interruption of essential services. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 102–105; **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 717–718.

58. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered injuries and damages, including, but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of her home;  
   b. Discomfort and inconvenience from being unable to bathe normally in her own home;  
   c. Inability to safely and reasonably bathe her baby at the Apartment;  
   d. Time, effort, and additional travel to her mother’s home to bathe her baby;  
   e. Time, effort, and additional travel to use gym facilities for showers;  
   f. Out‑of‑pocket costs for a gym membership (approximately $30 per month);  
   g. Additional transportation costs (gas) to and from the gym and her mother’s house; and  
   h. Diminished value of the Apartment and corresponding entitlement to rent abatement for the period without hot water.

59. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, so three months’ rent is $3,600.

60. Plaintiff currently estimates her actual damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment, rent abatement, and out‑of‑pocket expenses, to be approximately $450; however, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, she is entitled to recover at least three months’ rent ($3,600) as statutory damages if a violation is found, in addition to costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (even if she is self‑represented at present), or such other relief as the Court deems just.

61. Plaintiff reserves the right to refine the calculation of her damages, including the precise time period of deprivation of hot water and any continuing violations, in the course of this action.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Lopez respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant John Harrison, and award the following relief:

A. **Damages** for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including:

   1. Statutory damages in the amount of three (3) months’ rent ($3,600), or Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater; and  
   2. Any additional compensatory damages necessary to make Plaintiff whole, including but not limited to rent abatement, reimbursement of out‑of‑pocket expenses (such as gym fees and transportation costs), and compensation for loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment;

B. **Costs of the action**, including filing fees and other allowable costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;

C. **Reasonable attorney’s fees** pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 (to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel or as otherwise allowed by law);

D. **Declaratory relief** that Defendant’s failure to restore hot water within a reasonable time after notice constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

E. **Injunctive relief**, to the extent necessary, ordering Defendant to promptly restore and maintain hot water service to the Apartment in full compliance with the State Sanitary Code and applicable law;

F. **Such other and further relief** as this Court deems just and proper.
