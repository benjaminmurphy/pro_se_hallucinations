EMMA RICHARDSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

JACOB THOMPSON,  
  Defendant.  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No.: __________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
---------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emma Richardson, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Emma Richardson (“Mother” or “Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in Barnstable County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children who are the subject of this action.

2. The Defendant, Jacob Thompson (“Father” or “Defendant”), upon information and belief, resides in Barnstable County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children who are the subject of this action.

3. The parties are the parents of the following minor children:  
   a. Ava Thompson, born in 2015, currently age 10; and  
   b. Lucas Thompson, born in 2017, currently age 8 (collectively, “the Children”).

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of child custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as applicable, and the prior orders of this Court.

5. On June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order regarding custody and parenting time (the “2021 Custody Order”).

6. Under the 2021 Custody Order, the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the Children, and the Defendant has parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

7. At the time the 2021 Custody Order was entered, neither party was living with, or in a serious long‑term relationship with, a romantic partner, and the judgment contains no specific provisions addressing exposure of the Children to new romantic partners, stepparents, or other adult household members.

8. Venue is proper in the Barnstable County Probate and Family Court because the prior custody orders were entered here and because the parties and the Children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.

### II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

9. A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting time order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

10. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all determinations of custody and parenting time. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).

11. A material and substantial change in circumstances can include changes in the child’s environment, the conduct or circumstances of a parent, or the introduction of new adults into the child’s home environment when those changes impact the child’s safety or emotional well‑being. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262–63 (2001); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981).

12. The Court has broad equitable authority to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time, including requiring supervised parenting time or restricting the presence of third parties, in order to protect a child from potential harm. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 208, § 31A; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

13. The presence of domestic violence or a substantial risk of abuse in a household where a child resides or visits is a critical factor in custody and parenting time determinations. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595.

14. In determining the best interests of the child, the Court must consider the child’s safety and welfare, including exposure to violence, volatile conflict, and the character and stability of adults in the child’s environment. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998); Care & Protection of Lillith, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 141 (2004).

15. Massachusetts courts recognize that a child’s exposure to an adult with a history of violence, criminal behavior, or restraining orders can justify limitations or conditions on parenting time when necessary to protect the child’s physical or emotional well‑being. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843; Care & Protection of Ian, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 615, 617–18 (1999).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

16. Since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children’s safety and well‑being.

17. After the 2021 Custody Order, the Defendant became involved in a serious romantic relationship and is now cohabiting with a partner (hereinafter, “Defendant’s Partner”).

18. The Defendant’s Partner has a known criminal record, including at least one conviction or charge for assault and battery.

19. Upon information and belief, the Defendant’s Partner has had a prior restraining order (abuse prevention order under G.L. c. 209A) issued against them by a previous intimate partner.

20. The existence of a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order indicates a history and pattern of violent or abusive conduct, which is highly relevant to the Children’s safety. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595.

21. The Defendant’s Partner now resides in the same household where the Children stay during the Defendant’s alternate weekends and midweek parenting time.

22. At the time of the 2021 Custody Order, the Children were not exposed to any adult household member with a criminal history of violence or a history of restraining orders, and the Court could not have anticipated or specifically addressed this risk in that order.

23. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant’s Partner frequently yells, raises their voice in an angry manner, and slams doors in the home during times when the Children are present.

24. The Children have described to the Plaintiff that the atmosphere in the Defendant’s home is often tense, loud, and frightening when the Defendant’s Partner is present and arguing or yelling.

25. On at least one occasion, the Children reported that the Defendant’s Partner grabbed one of the Children by the arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark.

26. The Plaintiff personally observed a mark on the Child’s arm consistent with the Child’s report that the Defendant’s Partner grabbed the Child.

27. On another occasion, a neighbor called the police to the Defendant’s residence due to a loud argument or disturbance involving the Defendant’s Partner, during a time when the Children were present in the home.

28. The involvement of law enforcement in connection with a domestic disturbance while the Children were present further demonstrates an unsafe and unstable environment for the Children.

29. The introduction of a cohabiting partner with a criminal record for assault and battery, a history of restraining orders, and recent volatile behavior in the presence of the Children constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances since the 2021 Custody Order.

30. The Children are now older, more aware of their surroundings, and more capable of expressing fear and anxiety about the environment in which they spend parenting time, which also represents a changed circumstance affecting their best interests. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–63.

31. The circumstances described above were not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2021 Custody Order and fundamentally alter the risk profile and safety considerations regarding the Children’s time with the Defendant.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

32. The primary and paramount consideration in this case is the best interests of the Children. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41.

33. Children have a right to be safe and free from exposure to violence, intimidation, and volatile conflict in their home environments and during parenting time with either parent. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; G.L. c. 208, § 31A.

34. The presence of an adult with a documented history of assault and battery and a prior restraining order, combined with the Children’s reports of yelling, door‑slamming, and physical grabbing, creates a risk of both physical and emotional harm to the Children.

35. Exposure to frequent yelling, intimidation, and angry outbursts can cause anxiety, fear, sleep disturbances, and behavioral issues in children, and is contrary to their best interests and emotional development. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26.

36. The reported incident in which the Defendant’s Partner grabbed one of the Children hard enough to leave a mark indicates that the risk to the Children is not merely theoretical or speculative, but concrete and immediate.

37. The fact that a neighbor felt compelled to call the police due to a loud argument while the Children were present underscores the seriousness of the situation and the instability of the environment.

38. The Defendant, as the custodial parent during his parenting time, has a duty to protect the Children and to ensure that any adults in his household treat the Children appropriately and non‑violently.

39. While the Plaintiff recognizes the importance of the Children maintaining a relationship with the Defendant, that relationship must be structured and supervised, if necessary, in a way that protects the Children from exposure to potential abuse or violence, directly or indirectly. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05.

40. The requested modification—either prohibiting the presence of the Defendant’s Partner during the Defendant’s parenting time or, in the alternative, requiring that the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised—is narrowly tailored to address the specific risk posed by this changed circumstance.

41. Reasonable conditions on parenting time, such as restrictions on the presence of third parties with violent histories or supervised visitation, are appropriate and within the Court’s discretion when necessary to protect a child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–63.

42. The requested relief does not seek to sever the Children’s relationship with the Defendant, but rather to ensure that such relationship can continue in a manner that is safe and supportive of the Children’s physical and emotional well‑being.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

43. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

44. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the 2021 Custody Order based on the material and substantial change in circumstances described above, and in order to protect and promote the best interests of Ava and Lucas.

45. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order providing that:

   a. The Defendant shall not permit the Defendant’s current romantic partner (the adult with a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order) to be present in the home or to have any contact with the Children during any of the Defendant’s parenting time, whether at his residence or elsewhere; **or**, in the alternative,

   b. All of the Defendant’s parenting time with the Children shall be supervised by an agreed‑upon third party or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, with the costs, if any, to be allocated by the Court, for so long as the Defendant continues to reside with or maintain a close relationship with said Partner, or until further order of the Court.

46. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court clarify and confirm that the Plaintiff retains primary physical custody of the Children and that legal custody remain as ordered in the 2021 Custody Order, except as modified by this Complaint and subsequent orders.

47. The Plaintiff also requests that the Court enter any additional and further orders it deems necessary to safeguard the Children’s physical and emotional safety, including but not limited to:

   a. A requirement that the Defendant promptly notify the Plaintiff of any future police involvement at his residence or in the presence of the Children;  

   b. A requirement that the Defendant complete, as the Court deems appropriate, a parenting education or co‑parenting program and/or a program addressing conflict management and non‑violent communication; and  

   c. Such other conditions on third‑party contact as the Court finds to be in the Children’s best interests.

48. The requested modification is consistent with the statutory standards of G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, and 31A, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the controlling case law, including Custody of Kali, Custody of Vaughn, Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, Rosenthal v. Maney, Adoption of Hugo, and related authorities.

49. The Plaintiff brings this Complaint in good faith and solely for the purpose of protecting the health, safety, and best interests of the minor Children.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emma Richardson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2021 Custody Order, specifically including the Defendant’s cohabitation with a partner who has a criminal record for assault and battery, a prior restraining order, and has engaged in volatile and physically aggressive behavior in the presence of the Children;

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting time order is necessary to protect and promote the best interests of the minor Children, Ava and Lucas;

3. Modify the 2021 Custody Order to provide that the Defendant’s current romantic partner shall have no contact with the Children and shall not be present during any of the Defendant’s parenting time, whether at the Defendant’s residence or elsewhere;

4. **In the alternative**, if the Court does not order a complete prohibition on contact with the Defendant’s Partner, order that all of the Defendant’s parenting time with the Children be supervised by an appropriate third party or professional supervised visitation center approved by the Court, for so long as the Defendant continues to reside with or maintain a close relationship with said Partner, or until further order of the Court;

5. Enter such additional and further orders as the Court deems just and proper to ensure the Children’s safety, including but not limited to conditions concerning third‑party contact, reporting of police involvement, and completion of appropriate educational or counseling programs by the Defendant;

6. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
