JESSICA HARMON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Civil Action No. __________

MARK SULLIVAN,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff, Jessica Harmon (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant, Mark Sullivan (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), states as follows:

-------------------------------------  
I. PARTIES  
-------------------------------------

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harmon is an individual residing at 45 Beacon Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02143.

2. Defendant Mark Sullivan is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Premises”).

3. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant has acted as Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and has been responsible for compliance with the statutory and common-law obligations owed by landlords to residential tenants in Massachusetts.

-------------------------------------  
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
-------------------------------------

4. This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is approximately Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000), exclusive of costs, statutory enhancements, and attorney’s fees (if any are later incurred), and therefore falls within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court.

6. The Premises are located in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the complained-of conduct occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. Venue is therefore proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223 and G.L. c. 218, § 19.

-------------------------------------  
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
-------------------------------------

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease with Defendant for the second-floor apartment located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Apartment”).

8. The lease agreement provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Apartment.

9. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment since on or about January 1, 2022, and has fully and timely paid rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,800 per month.

10. Defendant rents the first-floor, second-floor, and third-floor units of the triple-decker property at 45 Beacon Street, and at all relevant times has been the landlord for both Plaintiff and the occupants of the third-floor apartment above Plaintiff.

11. Approximately six months prior to the filing of this Complaint (around June 2025), new tenants moved into the third-floor apartment above Plaintiff’s Apartment.

12. Since shortly after those tenants moved in, Plaintiff has been subjected to frequent, persistent, and excessive noise emanating from the apartment above, including but not limited to:

   a. Loud stomping and heavy footfalls at all hours of the day and night;  
   b. Music played at high volume late into the night;  
   c. Sounds of furniture and other heavy objects being moved around, often near or after midnight; and  
   d. Other intrusive impact noises that reverberate through Plaintiff’s ceiling and disturb her use of the Apartment.

13. The frequency and intensity of the noise have been such that Plaintiff has routinely been awakened multiple times per night and deprived of normal and reasonable rest.

14. As a direct result of the noise, Plaintiff has been averaging only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night.

15. Plaintiff has personally and politely requested that the upstairs tenants reduce their noise and be mindful of the hours and impact of their activities. While the tenants temporarily reduced their noise for approximately one week following Plaintiff’s request, they then returned to the same pattern of excessive noise.

16. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant about the excessive noise from the upstairs tenants on at least five or six separate occasions, beginning shortly after the noise problem arose and continuing over the following months.

17. After one such complaint, Defendant stated to Plaintiff that he had “talked to them once” but further told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live,” indicating an unwillingness to take further reasonable steps to address the ongoing interference.

18. Despite repeated notice from Plaintiff, Defendant failed and refused to take appropriate and reasonable steps to stop or materially reduce the excessive noise.

19. Defendant has control or the right to control the tenancy of the upstairs occupants, including the ability to issue written warnings, enforce lease provisions, and, if necessary, commence summary process or other enforcement actions to prevent ongoing substantial interference with other tenants’ quiet enjoyment.

20. Defendant’s failure to take adequate action after repeated complaints has allowed the harmful condition to become chronic, severe, and continuing.

21. The noise and disturbances from the upstairs apartment have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her Apartment, including but not limited to:

   a. Chronic sleep deprivation;  
   b. Difficulty concentrating and functioning at work;  
   c. Heightened stress and anxiety; and  
   d. Loss of the basic ability to peacefully occupy, rest, and live in her home.

22. As a result of her sleep deprivation and impaired functioning, Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk.

23. Plaintiff consulted with her doctor regarding her sleep problems, and her physician prescribed sleep medication, for which Plaintiff now pays approximately $40 per month.

24. Plaintiff has attempted to mitigate the impact of the noise by purchasing and using earplugs, a white noise machine, and by rearranging her bedroom furniture, but these efforts have been ineffective to remedy the interference.

25. Defendant has continued to collect full rent of $1,800 per month from Plaintiff despite the ongoing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

26. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy in Massachusetts and is expressly referenced in Plaintiff’s lease.

27. By failing to adequately respond to Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and by permitting the persistent, unreasonable noise from the upstairs tenants to continue for an extended period of time, Defendant has “directly or indirectly” interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

28. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been substantial, serious, and not merely trivial or transitory, and it has rendered the Apartment significantly less fit and comfortable as a place of residence.

29. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including (but not limited to) loss of sleep, emotional distress, loss of work standing and job security concerns, out-of-pocket medical and prescription expenses, and the diminished value of the rental premises during the period of interference. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her damages at approximately Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000), exclusive of any statutory trebling that may be awarded under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

30. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, the excessive noise and resulting interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment have continued for several months despite Defendant’s long-standing knowledge of the problem.

-------------------------------------  
IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
-------------------------------------

31. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. General Laws c. 186, § 14, provides in pertinent part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so “shall also be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

33. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law into residential tenancies in Massachusetts and is also expressed in Plaintiff’s lease. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

34. A landlord may be held liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord, by action or inaction, directly or indirectly allows conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises to persist. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

35. In Blackett v. Olanoff, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s failure to control noise from a lounge on the landlord’s property that substantially interfered with tenants’ quiet enjoyment constituted a breach of G.L. c. 186, § 14, even where the noise was produced by third parties. 371 Mass. at 718–19.

36. Likewise, Massachusetts courts have recognized that persistent disturbances and conditions caused by other tenants or third parties may support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment when the landlord, with notice, fails to take reasonable steps within his control to abate the condition. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–75 (1994); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

37. Here, Defendant had actual and repeated notice of the excessive noise and disturbances originating from the upstairs tenants and their activities and knew or should have known that these conditions were seriously interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and peacefully occupy her Apartment.

38. Defendant had the right and ability, as landlord, to take reasonable measures to address and abate the interference, including but not limited to issuing formal written notices to the offending tenants, enforcing lease provisions, imposing appropriate tenancy conditions, or, if necessary, initiating summary process or other legal remedies to terminate or modify the problematic tenancy.

39. Despite that actual notice and ability to act, Defendant failed to take sufficient, reasonable steps to stop or significantly reduce the excessive noise and instead expressly told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live,” effectively refusing to exercise his control or authority as landlord to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.

40. Defendant’s willful and/or negligent inaction, in the face of ongoing complaints and obvious harm to Plaintiff, amounts to an “indirect” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

41. Massachusetts law does not require that the landlord personally make noise or physically enter the premises; substantial interference resulting from the landlord’s failure to control foreseeable and controllable third-party conduct is sufficient. Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; see also Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

42. The interference suffered by Plaintiff is substantial and material and exceeds what a reasonable tenant should be expected to endure in a residential setting. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51 (describing the level of seriousness necessary for breach of quiet enjoyment); Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

43. Defendant’s actions and omissions have rendered Plaintiff’s Apartment significantly less fit and habitable and have deprived Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment for which she pays rent. This is precisely the harm that G.L. c. 186, § 14, is intended to prevent. See Cruz, 417 Mass. at 774–75; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of sleep and rest;  
   b. Physical and emotional distress, including stress, anxiety, and fatigue;  
   c. Work-related consequences, including a written warning at her job;  
   d. Out-of-pocket medical and prescription costs, including approximately $40 per month for sleep medication; and  
   e. The diminished value of the Apartment and loss of the benefit of her monthly rent payments during the period in which her quiet enjoyment was substantially impaired.

45. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to the greater of (a) actual and consequential damages or (b) three months’ rent, together with costs of the action and a reasonable attorney’s fee (if counsel is later retained).

46. Three months’ rent at Plaintiff’s monthly rate of $1,800 equals $5,400. Plaintiff’s reasonably estimated actual and consequential damages, exclusive of statutory enhancements, are at least $2,000.

47. Plaintiff therefore seeks, at a minimum, three months’ rent ($5,400) as statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, or such greater sum as the Court finds for actual and consequential damages, plus costs of this action and any attorney’s fees that may later be incurred.

48. In addition to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff’s claim and the relief sought are consistent with related landlord–tenant protections and concepts recognized in Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 239, § 8A (defenses and counterclaims in summary process), G.L. c. 93A (unfair or deceptive practices, where applicable), and the implied warranty of habitability recognized in Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); however, in this action Plaintiff asserts only the statutory and common-law claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

49. The principles applied by Massachusetts courts in Blackett, Cruz, Simon, Doe, Al-Ziab, and related cases confirm that Defendant’s knowing failure to abate persistent, serious disturbances originating from another tenant under his control constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment for which Plaintiff is entitled to statutory and actual damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

-------------------------------------  
V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
-------------------------------------

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Harmon, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Mark Sullivan, and grant the following relief:

   2. Additional actual and consequential damages for loss of sleep, emotional distress, medical and prescription costs, and diminished rental value, reasonably estimated at no less than $2,000, or such higher amount as the Court determines is just and proper;

C. An award of costs of this action, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;
