COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Kyle Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was the father and legal guardian of a minor child (“Minor Child” or “Child”) enrolled in the after-school program operated by Defendant.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) is a Massachusetts entity that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls a community center and after-school program located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant held itself out to the public as providing supervised after-school care and programming for children, including gym activities, at its facility in Brockton, Massachusetts.

4. The incident that is the subject of this Complaint occurred on or about September 15, 2023, in the gymnasium of Defendant’s facility located at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, and G.L. c. 212, § 3, in that the claims asserted are civil claims sounding in negligence and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the cause of action arose in Brockton, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business and operates the subject premises in Brockton.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its officers, employees, agents, and/or apparent agents, was responsible for the supervision, safety, and care of children, including Plaintiff’s Minor Child, during the after-school program.

GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

8. Plaintiff’s Minor Child, age eight (8) at the time of the incident and small for his age, was enrolled in and regularly attended Defendant’s after-school program at the Brockton Community Center.

9. Defendant advertised, represented, and promised to parents and guardians, including Plaintiff, that children in the after-school program would be supervised at all times in the gym and during after-school activities.

10. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s Minor Child attended Defendant’s after-school program and participated in activities in the gymnasium area of Defendant’s facility.

11. On that date and at that time, Defendant assigned only two staff members to supervise approximately twenty (20) children in the gymnasium.

12. During the relevant period, one of the two staff members left the gymnasium and went to an office area to do paperwork, leaving a single staff person physically present in the gym.

13. The remaining staff person positioned herself near the bleachers and spent substantial time looking at and using her phone, instead of actively supervising the children engaged in physical play and athletic activity on the gym floor.

14. While Defendant’s staff member was inattentive and distracted by her phone, two older and significantly larger boys, approximately twelve (12) years old, began engaging in a rough, tackle-style game on the hardwood gym floor.

15. The tackle game involved physical contact and bodies being thrown or driven to the floor, which created a reasonably foreseeable and unreasonable risk of serious injury to younger and smaller children present in the same play area.

16. Some of the other children in the gym, alarmed and concerned by the rough play, notified the staff member who was supposed to be supervising, specifically informing her that the older boys were playing too rough.

17. Instead of intervening, separating the children, enforcing safety rules, or otherwise taking reasonable steps to protect the children, the staff member responded by saying “boys will be boys,” and failed to stop the dangerous conduct or to establish a safe play environment.

18. Defendant, through its staff, failed to maintain any meaningful separation between older, larger children engaging in rough physical play and younger, smaller children, such as Plaintiff’s Minor Child.

19. Defendant, through its staff, failed to enforce appropriate rules regarding tackling, contact sports, or rough play on a hard-surface gym floor, despite the obvious risk of head and bodily injury.

20. Defendant, through its staff, failed to adequately monitor, supervise, intervene, or redirect the unsafe conduct of the older children, despite actual notice from other children that the situation was dangerous.

21. While the tackle game continued unchecked, one of the larger, older boys tackled or collided forcefully with Plaintiff’s Minor Child, driving him to the hardwood gym floor.

22. As a direct result of this collision and the impact with the hardwood floor, Plaintiff’s Minor Child struck his head, lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds, and suffered a concussion.

23. Defendant’s staff failed to prevent this foreseeable injury despite having both (a) physical presence in the gym, and (b) actual knowledge and warning that dangerous, rough play was occurring.

24. Following the incident, Plaintiff’s Minor Child required emergency medical evaluation and treatment at a hospital emergency room for head trauma and concussion.

25. Plaintiff’s Minor Child missed several days of school and suffered symptoms associated with concussion, including but not limited to pain, headaches, dizziness, and emotional distress.

26. Plaintiff, as the parent and legal guardian of the Minor Child, incurred medical expenses of approximately Five Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($5,500.00) arising from diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care for the concussion.

27. Plaintiff did not lose wages as a result of the incident, but has incurred and continues to incur non-wage damages related to his Child’s injuries, including the Child’s pain and suffering and loss of usual activities, and Plaintiff’s loss of parental peace of mind and disruption of family life associated with the Child’s injury and medical treatment.

28. Defendant knew or should have known that allowing older, larger children to engage in unsupervised or under-supervised tackling or rough physical games on a hardwood gym floor in close proximity to younger, smaller children, without adequate supervision, rules, or intervention, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of serious physical injury, including concussion.

29. Defendant held itself out as experienced in caring for and supervising children, and assumed a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect Plaintiff’s Minor Child from foreseeable harm while in its custody and control.

30. The risk that a young child might be struck, thrown to the ground, or otherwise injured during unsupervised rough play involving older children in a gym is precisely the type of harm that reasonable supervision is intended to prevent.

31. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate staffing, active supervision, and timely intervention was a substantial factor in causing the incident and the resulting injuries to Plaintiff’s Minor Child.

32. Plaintiff and his Minor Child did not contribute to the creation of the dangerous condition, had no reasonable ability to control the behavior of the older children, and reasonably relied on Defendant’s promises and duty to provide competent and continuous supervision during the after-school program.

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s Minor Child sustained physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, and Plaintiff incurred medical expenses and other damages.

COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  
(Against Brockton Community Center)  

34. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 33 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

Duty  

35. Under Massachusetts law, a person or entity that undertakes the care and supervision of a child owes that child a duty to exercise reasonable care in all circumstances, including a duty to provide adequate supervision and to protect the child from reasonably foreseeable harm. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331 (1983); Irwin v. Town of Ware, 392 Mass. 745, 468 N.E.2d 1292 (1984).

36. Defendant, by operating an after-school program for children and inviting Plaintiff’s Minor Child to participate, undertook a custodial and supervisory role and thereby owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff’s Minor Child. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 52–55 (special relationship and voluntary assumption of custody create duty of care); Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37, 907 N.E.2d 213 (2009) (duty arising from special relationship and undertaking).

37. Defendant, as the operator of a place of public accommodation and a recreational facility, further owed a duty to maintain its premises and activities in a reasonably safe condition and to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable injuries to children lawfully present. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 706, 297 N.E.2d 43 (1973) (general duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 652 N.E.2d 567 (1995).

38. Defendant’s duty of care included, without limitation: (a) the duty to provide adequate staffing and supervision in the gym; (b) the duty to monitor and control rough or dangerous play among children; (c) the duty to respond reasonably to reports or warnings that certain children were engaging in unsafe conduct; and (d) the duty to implement and enforce reasonable safety rules appropriate to the ages, sizes, and numbers of children present.

39. Defendant knew or should have known that children, particularly older boys, may engage in roughhousing and physically risky behavior in a gym setting, and that younger and smaller children are particularly vulnerable to injury in such circumstances. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 54–55 (foreseeability of harm shapes duty); Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 378 N.E.2d 995 (1978).

Breach  

40. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

41. Defendant negligently failed to provide adequate staffing and supervision by permitting one of two staff members to leave the gym, thereby leaving only one staff member to purportedly supervise approximately twenty (20) children engaged in physical activities.

42. Defendant negligently allowed the remaining staff member to remain seated or standing near the bleachers, distracted by and focused on her phone, rather than actively moving about the gym and monitoring the children’s play.

43. Defendant negligently failed to establish, communicate, and enforce reasonable rules regarding safe play, prohibiting tackle-style or similarly dangerous physical contact games on a hard gym floor, particularly in mixed-age groups.

44. Defendant negligently failed to respond appropriately to actual notice from other children that the older boys were playing too rough; instead of intervening, the staff member dismissed the concern with the remark “boys will be boys” and took no meaningful corrective or protective action.

45. Defendant negligently failed to separate younger, smaller children, including Plaintiff’s Minor Child, from older, larger children engaged in high-risk, physical, tackle-style play.

46. Defendant negligently failed to identify and mitigate an obvious and unreasonable risk of serious head and body injury posed by unsupervised or under-supervised tackle play on a hard-surface floor.

47. Defendant’s personnel policies, training, supervision of its own staff, and day-to-day practices were inadequate and unreasonable in light of the known risks associated with children at play in a gym environment. See Kelley v. Rossi, 395 Mass. 659, 481 N.E.2d 1340 (1985) (negligent supervision as basis for liability).

48. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care that a reasonably prudent operator of an after-school program and youth recreation facility in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would exercise under similar circumstances. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 723 N.E.2d 779 (2000).

Causation  

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff’s Minor Child was violently tackled or collided with by an older, larger child, resulting in his fall to the hardwood gym floor, impact to his head, loss of consciousness, and concussion.

50. Had Defendant maintained adequate staffing, actively supervised the children, responded promptly to complaints about rough play, prohibited tackle-style games on the hard floor, and separated older and younger children, the dangerous situation would have been corrected, and the incident and resulting injuries to Plaintiff’s Minor Child would, more likely than not, have been prevented. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 54–56; Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 849 N.E.2d 829 (2006) (foreseeability and scope of risk in negligence causation analysis).

51. The harm suffered by Plaintiff’s Minor Child—injury from being tackled and striking his head during rough, unsupervised play in a gym—was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise due care in supervising the children. See Jesionek, 376 Mass. at 105; Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 671 N.E.2d 156 (1996).

Damages  

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s Minor Child sustained bodily injury, including but not limited to a concussion, head trauma, pain, and related physical and emotional symptoms.

53. Plaintiff’s Minor Child endured physical pain, emotional distress, anxiety, and mental suffering arising from the incident and the resulting injury and medical treatment. See Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 437 N.E.2d 171 (1982) (recovery for emotional distress associated with physical injury).

54. Plaintiff’s Minor Child missed several days of school and was temporarily deprived of the normal activities, play, and enjoyment of life appropriate to his age, constituting loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of his usual activities.

55. Plaintiff has incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses for the care and treatment of his Minor Child’s injuries, in an amount presently estimated at approximately Five Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($5,500.00), and may incur additional medical and related expenses in the future.

56. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is also entitled to prejudgment interest on the amount of his damages from the date of commencement of this action.

57. Under Massachusetts law, a parent may recover for medical expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of a minor child as a result of the child’s injuries. See Sorensen v. Sorensen, 369 Mass. 350, 339 N.E.2d 907 (1975); G.L. c. 231, § 85M.

58. Plaintiff and his Minor Child are entitled to recover all damages reasonably flowing from Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to: medical expenses, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other cognizable damages under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 328 N.E.2d 873 (1975).

59. No act or omission by Plaintiff or his Minor Child constituted negligence that was greater than the negligence of Defendant, and to the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff invokes the protections of G.L. c. 231, § 85, which provides that contributory negligence does not bar recovery if the plaintiff’s negligence was not greater than that of the defendant, and that any damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the plaintiff.

60. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial, predominant, and legal cause of the incident and of all injuries and damages alleged herein.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Kyle Johnson, individually and as parent and natural guardian of his Minor Child, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Brockton Community Center, and grant the following relief:

  3. Plaintiff’s Minor Child’s loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of his normal activities;
