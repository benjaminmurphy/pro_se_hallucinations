### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY / PREMISES LIABILITY)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Fresh Mart Grocery (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on the premises owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled by Defendant.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Fresh Mart Grocery is a business entity doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, operating a retail grocery store located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, maintained, and/or controlled the Premises and was responsible for the safety and condition of the aisles and walking surfaces therein, including the dairy aisle where Plaintiff fell.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for negligence arising from personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff at Defendant’s Premises on August 12, 2023.

5. The Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, when considering Plaintiff’s medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Superior Court, Somerville Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1–2, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and Defendant transacts business and maintains a regular place of business there.

7. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant conducts business in Massachusetts, owns/operates the Premises in Somerville, and the tortious conduct alleged herein occurred within the Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 223A, §§ 3(a), 3(d).

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about August 12, 2023, at approximately a Saturday afternoon hour, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a paying customer to shop for groceries.

9. Plaintiff was walking in the dairy aisle of the store, exercising due care for her own safety, when she encountered a puddle of spilled milk on the floor.

10. The puddle of spilled milk was not minor or trivial; it was substantial enough that cart tracks were visibly going through it, indicating that other customers had already passed through the area after the spill occurred.

11. There were no visible warning signs, cones, “wet floor” notices, or any other means of warning customers of the dangerous condition in or around the puddle at the time of Plaintiff’s fall.

12. At all relevant times, Defendant had one or more employees in the vicinity of the dairy aisle, including an employee stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the puddle where Plaintiff fell.

13. As Plaintiff walked in the dairy aisle, she stepped into the puddle of spilled milk, slipped, and fell hard onto her hip, landing on the floor.

14. After Plaintiff’s fall, the nearby employee came over to Plaintiff and, in sum and substance, stated that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing what he was doing before going to get the mop.

15. The employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition before Plaintiff’s fall and failed to take reasonable steps to either clean up the spill or warn customers in a timely manner.

16. Alternatively, and/or in addition, the visible cart tracks through the spilled milk indicate that the spill had existed for a sufficient period of time that, in the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant should have discovered and remedied the condition before Plaintiff’s fall, thereby establishing constructive notice.

17. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including aisles and walking surfaces, in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or remedy unreasonably dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known.

18. After her fall, Plaintiff felt shaken and sore but initially believed she might be able to continue her activities. She completed her grocery shopping and left the store.

19. Later that day and into the evening, Plaintiff’s right (or left) hip (hereinafter “the affected hip”) became increasingly painful, stiff, and difficult to move.

20. On or about August 13, 2023, Plaintiff presented to an urgent care facility due to significant pain and difficulty ambulating.

21. At urgent care, Plaintiff was evaluated, and it was determined that she had sustained a hip sprain as a result of the fall.

22. Plaintiff was prescribed treatment for her hip sprain, including rest, pain management, and a course of physical therapy.

23. Plaintiff underwent physical therapy to address the pain, decreased range of motion, and functional limitations resulting from the hip sprain.

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses for urgent care, follow-up visits, and physical therapy.

25. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff was unable to work certain scheduled shifts at her café job while recovering, resulting in approximately $800 in lost wages.

26. Plaintiff continues to experience, or has experienced for a substantial period after the incident, pain, discomfort, and limitations associated with the hip injury, including difficulty standing or walking for prolonged periods and difficulty performing certain physical activities.

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer physical pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress related to the incident and her resulting limitations.

28. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action, if any, or such conditions have been waived or excused.

## IV. NEGLIGENCE (PREMISES LIABILITY)  
(Against Defendant Fresh Mart Grocery)

29. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully set forth herein.

30. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land who invites members of the public onto the premises for business purposes owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, and to warn of or remedy dangers that the possessor knows or reasonably should know about. See, e.g., *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 373–75 (2010).

31. Defendant, as the owner, operator, and/or controller of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a lawful business invitee, a duty to:  
   a. Use reasonable care to inspect and maintain the aisles and walking surfaces, including the dairy aisle, in a reasonably safe condition;  
   b. Remedy, clean up, or otherwise remove dangerous conditions such as spilled liquids on the floor within a reasonable time after they occurred or were discovered or should have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable care; and  
   c. Provide adequate warnings or barriers regarding any unreasonably dangerous conditions that could not be immediately remedied.

32. Massachusetts law recognizes that a store owner has a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect customers from foreseeable dangers that arise in areas open to customers, including foreign substances on the floor. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–84 (2007); *Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515, 517–18 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law).

33. Defendant, either through its employees and/or agents, had actual knowledge of the spilled milk prior to Plaintiff’s fall, as evidenced by the employee’s admission that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes” before but chose to finish stocking shelves before addressing the spill.

34. Even if Defendant lacked actual knowledge, the presence of cart tracks through the puddle shows that the condition existed for a sufficient length of time that, in the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant should have discovered and remedied it, thereby giving rise to constructive notice under Massachusetts law. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 784–86 (discussing proof of notice in slip‑and‑fall cases); *Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 166–68 (1973).

35. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to maintain the dairy aisle in a reasonably safe condition;  
   b. Failing to timely clean up, remove, or otherwise remedy the spilled milk on the floor after becoming aware, or when Defendant reasonably should have become aware, of the condition;  
   c. Failing to place any warning cones, signs, or other markers near the puddle to alert customers, including Plaintiff, to the dangerous condition;  
   d. Failing to implement and/or follow reasonable inspection and maintenance procedures for the Premises, including the dairy aisle where liquid spills are reasonably foreseeable;  
   e. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees regarding prompt and proper responses to spills and dangerous conditions, including immediate warning and cleanup;  
   f. Allowing an employee who had actual knowledge of the spill to delay taking corrective action while continuing other tasks; and  
   g. Otherwise failing to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person or grocery store operator would exercise under similar circumstances.

36. Under Massachusetts negligence law, Defendant’s duty and breach are measured by the standard of ordinary care and foreseeability. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (duty of reasonable care and foreseeability of harm); *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37, 40–41 (2009) (basic elements of negligence).

37. The risk that a customer might slip and fall on spilled liquid in a grocery store aisle is plainly foreseeable and well recognized in Massachusetts premises liability law. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 783–84; *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 377–78.

38. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions described above, Plaintiff slipped in the spilled milk, fell onto her hip, and sustained a hip sprain and associated injuries.

39. Causation and compensable damages are core elements of a negligence claim under Massachusetts law. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 146; *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages).

40. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s fall, injuries, and damages, and such harm was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to remedy or warn of the spilled milk.

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred, and will in the future reasonably incur, medical expenses, including but not limited to: urgent care treatment, follow‑up visits, diagnostic testing as required, physical therapy, and any additional care reasonably related to the hip injury.

42. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date are approximately $1,200, and Plaintiff reasonably expects to incur additional medical costs in the future as needed.

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff was unable to perform her work at her café job for a period of time, causing her to miss shifts and lose income.

44. Plaintiff’s lost wages to date are approximately $800, and Plaintiff may have diminished earning capacity or lost opportunities as a result of limitations related to her injury.

45. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain pain and suffering, physical discomfort, and restrictions in activities of daily living and recreational pursuits.

46. Plaintiff has also suffered and will continue to suffer loss of enjoyment of life and emotional distress related to the incident, her injuries, and the limitations imposed by those injuries.

47. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for all injuries and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including, but not limited to: past and future medical expenses, lost wages and diminished earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. See, e.g., *Wells v. Town of Concord*, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 319–20 (1979); G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85.

48. To the extent that Defendant contends that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, any such negligence, which Plaintiff expressly denies, would only proportionally reduce recovery, not bar it, under Massachusetts comparative negligence statutes. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence).

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, Plaintiff is also entitled to prejudgment interest on any judgment entered in her favor from the date of commencement of this action.

50. Plaintiff asserts her right to a trial by jury under the Massachusetts Constitution and G.L. c. 231, § 60.
