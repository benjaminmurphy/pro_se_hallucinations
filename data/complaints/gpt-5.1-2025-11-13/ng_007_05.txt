### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  
_______________________________  

Plaintiff Ethan Johnson (“Plaintiff”), individually and as parent and next friend of his minor son, [J.J.], for his Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Ethan Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is the father and legal guardian of his minor son, [J.J.], age eight at the time of the incident described below.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts nonprofit or other legal entity operating a community center and after‑school program for children at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled the premises located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, and operated an after‑school program in the gymnasium on those premises.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant held itself out to the public, including Plaintiff, as providing structured, supervised after‑school care and activities for minor children, including supervision “at all times” in the gym.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 and G.L. c. 231, § 1, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and this is an action sounding in tort.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is organized under the laws of Massachusetts and/or regularly conducts business in Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred within Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, §§ 1–3.

7. Venue is proper in Bristol County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred at Defendant’s facility at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, which is within Bristol County, and Defendant conducts business in this county.

---

## III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

8. Defendant operates an after‑school program at its community center in Brockton, Massachusetts, including use of a gymnasium for physical activities by children.

9. Defendant advertises and represents to parents, including Plaintiff, that children enrolled in the after‑school program will be supervised “at all times” in the gym and that the program is a safe environment for children.

10. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s representations regarding supervision and safety when enrolling his minor son, [J.J.], in Defendant’s after‑school program.

11. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s son, [J.J.], then approximately eight years old and small for his age, was participating in Defendant’s after‑school program in the gymnasium at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

12. At that time, there were approximately twenty (20) children in the gymnasium.

13. Defendant’s staffing plan and/or policy for the gym at that time required two staff members to supervise approximately twenty children.

14. Notwithstanding that policy, only one staff member remained in the gym with the children; the second staff member left the gym to go to the office to perform paperwork, thereby leaving only one staff member to supervise approximately twenty children.

15. The remaining staff member was positioned near the bleachers and was largely focused on her personal cell phone rather than actively supervising the children and their activities.

16. While the children were in the gym, two older boys, approximately twelve (12) years old, began engaging in a rough tackle game on the hardwood gym floor, involving physical tackling and contact inappropriate for an unstructured, unsupervised, mixed‑age play setting.

17. The rough tackle game created an obvious and escalating risk of harm to younger, smaller children, including Plaintiff’s eight‑year‑old son.

18. Other children, observing the rough and dangerous play, notified the supervising staff member and alerted her to the behavior of the older boys.

19. In response to those warnings, the staff member dismissed the concerns and replied, in substance, “boys will be boys,” and failed to intervene, instruct, separate, discipline, or otherwise control the rough play.

20. The staff member failed to stop the tackle game, failed to remove the older boys from the gym, failed to separate the age groups, and failed to take any reasonable measures to protect younger children from foreseeable harm.

21. As a direct result of the lack of supervision and failure to intervene, the rough tackle game continued unabated on the hardwood floor.

22. During the course of that game, one of the larger, older boys tackled Plaintiff’s minor son, [J.J.], with force, causing [J.J.] to fall and strike his head on the hardwood floor.

23. Upon impact, [J.J.] lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

24. The loss of consciousness and head trauma constituted a medical emergency requiring prompt and competent response and care.

25. Following the incident, [J.J.] was transported to the emergency department, where he was evaluated and diagnosed with a concussion.

26. As a result of the concussion, [J.J.] experienced symptoms including but not limited to headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion, fatigue, and emotional distress.

27. [J.J.] missed several days of school and was restricted from normal activities, including physical play, sports, and screen time, as part of concussion protocol.

28. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for evaluation and treatment of his son’s injuries in an amount of approximately $4,500 as of the filing of this Complaint, and such expenses were reasonable and necessary.

29. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to time taken off from work to care for his injured son, attend medical appointments, and monitor his son’s recovery.

30. At all material times, Defendant, through its employees and agents, had a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising the minor children entrusted to its care, to provide adequate staffing, and to protect the children from unreasonable and foreseeable risks of harm.

31. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that unstructured roughhousing and tackling by older, larger boys on a hardwood gym floor in proximity to much younger, smaller children created a significant and foreseeable risk of serious injury to those younger children.

32. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that leaving only one distracted staff member to supervise approximately twenty children in the gym, and permitting one staff member to leave for office paperwork, created an unreasonable risk of harm to the children in its care.

33. Defendant’s failure to enforce its own staffing and supervision policies, failure to adequately train and supervise its staff, and failure to respond reasonably to the reports of dangerous play directly and proximately caused [J.J.]’s injuries.

34. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s minor son has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and potential future effects from his concussion.

35. Plaintiff, as parent and next friend, has incurred and will continue to incur medical expenses on behalf of his minor son, and has experienced the disruption of family life and anxiety and distress over his son’s injury and recovery.

36. Plaintiff has complied with all procedural prerequisites to filing this action to the extent any may be applicable.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  
(Individually and as Parent and Next Friend of Minor Child)

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

### Duty

38. Under Massachusetts common law, a person or entity that undertakes the supervision and care of a minor child owes that child a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the child from foreseeable harm. See *Wallace v. Wilson*, 411 Mass. 8, 12 (1991) (recognizing duty of those responsible for children’s supervision); *Irwin v. Town of Ware*, 392 Mass. 745, 756 (1984) (duty arises from foreseeable risk of harm).

39. Entities such as community centers, schools, and youth programs that invite children onto their premises and assume custody and control of those children owe a duty to exercise the care of a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances, including (a) providing adequate supervision, (b) maintaining appropriate staff‑to‑child ratios, and (c) intervening when dangerous play or conduct arises. See *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401, 408 (1991); *Mueller v. N. Andover Youth Hockey Ass’n*, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 599 (1996).

40. Defendant, by operating an after‑school program, inviting children to participate, and accepting payment and/or enrollment for that program, voluntarily assumed the duty to supervise and protect those children with reasonable care.

41. Defendant also owed Plaintiff, as parent, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the performance of its undertaking to supervise Plaintiff’s child, and to avoid subjecting Plaintiff to foreseeable economic loss and emotional distress arising from physical injury to his child. See *Ferriter v. Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, Inc.*, 381 Mass. 507, 516–17 (1980); *Dziokonski v. Babineau*, 375 Mass. 555, 568–69 (1978).

### Breach

42. Defendant, acting through its employees and agents within the scope of their employment, breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff’s son in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to provide adequate and appropriate supervision in the gymnasium for approximately twenty children;

   b. Permitting one of two staff members to leave the gym to perform office paperwork, leaving an insufficient number of supervisors in the gym contrary to reasonable safety practices and/or Defendant’s own staffing policies;

   c. Allowing the remaining staff member to remain near the bleachers and to focus on her cell phone instead of actively supervising the children and their activities;

   d. Failing to respond appropriately to reports by other children that two older boys were engaging in a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor;

   e. Failing to stop or control the rough tackling game once it was or should have been known to Defendant’s staff;

   f. Failing to separate older and larger children from much younger and smaller children in the context of rough physical play;

   g. Failing to implement and/or enforce reasonable policies and procedures regarding safe play, supervision, and intervention when dangerous conduct occurs;

   h. Failing to properly train, supervise, and discipline staff to ensure that they understood and carried out their supervisory responsibilities; and

   i. Failing otherwise to act as a reasonably prudent community center or youth program operator would have acted under similar circumstances.

43. Under Massachusetts law, negligence consists of the failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

44. A jury could conclude that a reasonably prudent after‑school program, aware that older boys were playing a rough tackle game on a hardwood floor near younger children, and aware that only one distracted staff member was in the gym, would have (a) maintained adequate staffing, (b) promptly intervened to stop the rough play, and (c) implemented policies to prevent such conduct, and that Defendant’s failure to do so was unreasonable in light of the foreseeable risk of head injury.

### Causation and Foreseeability

45. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable where its negligent conduct is a cause of the plaintiff’s injury and the type of harm was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conduct. See *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978); *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996).

46. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above were a direct and proximate cause of the injury to Plaintiff’s minor son. But for Defendant’s inadequate supervision and failure to intervene, the rough tackle game would have been stopped or prevented, and [J.J.] would not have been tackled and would not have suffered a concussion.

47. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that rough tackling on a hardwood floor by older boys could cause serious injury, including head injuries and concussions, to younger and smaller children exposed to such play.

48. It was also reasonably foreseeable that a lack of adequate supervision, and allowing staff to be distracted by personal cell phones, would increase the risk that dangerous conduct among children would go unchecked and result in injury.

### Damages

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s minor son, [J.J.], sustained physical injuries, including but not limited to a concussion and its sequelae, including loss of consciousness, pain, headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms.

50. [J.J.] has suffered pain and suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to participate in normal activities, sports, and play during his recovery.

51. Plaintiff, as parent and next friend, has incurred medical expenses for his son’s emergency room visit, diagnostic tests, follow‑up care, and related treatment in an amount of approximately $4,500 as of the date of this Complaint, and is likely to incur additional medical expenses in the future.

52. Plaintiff has lost approximately $1,200 in wages as a result of having to miss work to care for his injured son, to attend medical appointments, and to provide supervision and support during his son’s recovery.

53. Plaintiff has also suffered emotional distress, worry, and disruption to family life as a result of witnessing his son’s injury and dealing with its consequences, which are the natural and foreseeable result of physical injury to his child caused by Defendant’s negligence. See *Ferriter*, 381 Mass. at 516–17.

54. Under Massachusetts law, a negligent tortfeasor is responsible for all damages that are the natural and probable consequence of the negligent act, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See *Griffin v. Gen. Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362, 366 (1980); *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 547–48 (1982).

55. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for his son’s injuries and related losses, including but not limited to:

   a. Past and future medical expenses incurred on behalf of his minor son;

   b. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life suffered by his son;

   c. Plaintiff’s lost wages and loss of earning capacity related to caring for his injured son;

   d. Reasonable out‑of‑pocket expenses; and

   e. Such other general and special damages as will be proven at trial.

56. To the extent any comparative negligence or conduct of third parties is alleged by Defendant, Plaintiff asserts that the negligence of Defendant was a substantial contributing factor and far exceeded any alleged negligence of others, and that Plaintiff’s minor son, given his age, cannot be found comparatively negligent under Massachusetts law. See *G.L. c. 231, § 85* (comparative negligence standard); *Gosselin v. Better Homes, Inc.*, 351 Mass. 703, 705–06 (1967) (standard of care for children); *Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 58–59 (1988) (child’s conduct measured by child‑of‑like‑age standard).

57. Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees and agents under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).
