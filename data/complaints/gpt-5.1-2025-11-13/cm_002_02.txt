    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), self‑represented, and complains of the Defendant, Mark Davis (“Defendant” or “Father”), and says as follows:

                                   I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Davis.

2. The Defendant, Mark Davis, is an individual and the father of the minor child, Sophie Davis. Upon information and belief, the Defendant presently resides, or intends imminently to reside, in the State of New Hampshire.

3. The minor child, Sophie Davis (“Sophie” or “the child”), is eight (8) years old and has at all relevant times resided primarily with the Plaintiff in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

                             II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time with respect to Sophie pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 208, § 29, and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as the original custody and parenting-time judgment was issued by this Court on or about March 15, 2020.

5. Venue in the Middlesex Division of the Probate and Family Court is proper because the original Judgment was entered here and the child resides in Middlesex County. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 223, § 1.

6. Massachusetts remains Sophie’s “home state” for purposes of custody determination under the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G.L. c. 209B, and Massachusetts retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the existing custody order.

                      III. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

7. On or about March 15, 2020, this Court entered a Judgment or Order concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time for Sophie (the “2020 Custody Order”).

8. Under the 2020 Custody Order, the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Sophie. The Defendant has parenting time consisting of every Wednesday and every other weekend, based on the parties then residing in close geographic proximity in or near Cambridge, Massachusetts.

9. The schedule in the 2020 Custody Order was expressly and/or impliedly premised on all parties residing reasonably near each other, so that Sophie could attend her local school regularly, participate in after‑school activities, and maintain a stable and predictable daily routine.

10. Since entry of the 2020 Custody Order, the parties have generally followed the parenting-time schedule, and Sophie has been enrolled in and attending school in Massachusetts and participating in local after‑school activities.

                       IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

11. After the entry of the 2020 Custody Order, the Defendant obtained or pursued a job opportunity in the State of New Hampshire and now intends to relocate his residence to New Hampshire while maintaining the existing parenting-time schedule unchanged.

12. The contemplated relocation creates a significant increase in travel time and distance between the Plaintiff’s home (and Sophie’s school and activities) in Massachusetts and the Defendant’s residence in New Hampshire, such that midweek overnight parenting time would require approximately ninety (90) minutes of driving each way in typical traffic conditions.

13. To exercise the existing Wednesday overnight under the new circumstances, Sophie would have to:

   a. Leave home or school early on Wednesdays, travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way to and from New Hampshire;  

   b. Spend the night at the Defendant’s New Hampshire residence; and  

   c. Wake up significantly earlier than usual on Thursday mornings to travel back approximately ninety (90) minutes to her Massachusetts school in time for the school day.  

14. The required travel for a midweek overnight, with associated early wake times and late returns, would be especially burdensome given Sophie’s age (eight years old) and developmental needs.

15. Sophie has already begun expressing anxiety about the prospect of long weekday drives, early mornings, and missing or being late to her established after‑school activities and social commitments in Massachusetts.

16. The length and timing of the proposed midweek travel risk interfering with Sophie’s:

   a. Regular school attendance and punctuality;  

   b. Completion of homework and academic responsibilities;  

   c. Participation in after-school activities and sports;  

   d. Ability to maintain a consistent bedtime and adequate sleep; and  

   e. Emotional stability and sense of security in her primary home and community.  

17. The Defendant’s relocation substantially alters the factual foundation upon which the 2020 Custody Order was based—namely, that the parties lived in close proximity such that midweek overnights would not impose unreasonable travel or disrupt the child’s educational and extracurricular routines.

18. The Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a parenting schedule that was reasonable under one set of circumstances may warrant modification when circumstances materially change, particularly where the child’s stability, education, or emotional welfare is affected. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Murphy v. Murphy*, 380 Mass. 454 (1980).

19. Under Massachusetts law, modification of a custody or parenting-time judgment is appropriate where (1) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 186–87 (2006); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); G.L. c. 208, § 28.

20. The Defendant’s relocation, the resulting travel demands, and the impact on Sophie’s school and activities constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not anticipated at the time of the 2020 Custody Order.

21. The best interests of the child are the paramount concern in any custody or parenting-time determination or modification. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266 (2001); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

22. Continued enforcement of the existing midweek overnight schedule now that the Defendant is in or moving to New Hampshire would compromise Sophie’s best interests by:

   a. Undermining her educational stability and consistency;  

   b. Interfering with after‑school programs that support her social and emotional development;  

   c. Increasing her fatigue and stress due to long commutes and early wake times; and  

   d. Creating anxiety associated with excessive travel and potential lateness or absences.  

23. Massachusetts courts recognize that parenting plans must be workable in light of the parties’ actual geography and the child’s school obligations, and that long midweek commutes may be inconsistent with the child’s welfare. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 186–87 (modification appropriate where existing arrangement no longer serves child’s best interests); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

24. The requested modification does not seek to diminish the Defendant’s meaningful relationship with Sophie but rather to re‑structure parenting time so that it is realistically compatible with her school schedule and developmental needs.

25. The Plaintiff seeks only to eliminate the midweek overnight and to adjust the weekend schedule, preserving the Defendant’s opportunity for frequent and meaningful contact while protecting Sophie’s educational and emotional well‑being.

26. It is in Sophie’s best interests that her primary weekday residence remain with the Plaintiff near her school and activities and that her parenting time with the Defendant be structured primarily on weekends and non‑school days.

27. The relief requested herein is consistent with the statutory framework for modification of custody and parenting time, including G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 208, §§ 31–31A, and with controlling caselaw such as *Mason v. Coleman*, *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Rosenthal v. Maney*, *Murphy v. Murphy*, *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, *Rolde v. Rolde*, and *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

28. There are no other pending actions in any court concerning custody of the minor child, to the best of the Plaintiff’s knowledge, information, and belief.

                            V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

29. The Plaintiff requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2020 Custody Order and that modification of the parenting-time provisions is necessary and in Sophie’s best interests.

30. The Plaintiff requests that the Court reaffirm that the Plaintiff shall continue to have primary physical custody of Sophie, with both parents sharing legal custody as set forth in the existing order, unless the Court finds otherwise.

31. The Plaintiff specifically requests that the existing Wednesday (midweek) overnight parenting time with the Defendant be removed, so that Sophie is not required to engage in extensive interstate commuting on school nights.

32. In place of the midweek overnight, the Plaintiff proposes that weekday contact be maintained, if appropriate, through:

   a. Reasonable midweek dinner visits near Sophie’s school or home, at times that do not interfere with school or after-school activities; and/or  

   b. Reasonable electronic/virtual contact (telephone, video calls, etc.) at mutually agreed‑upon times.  

33. The Plaintiff further requests that the weekend parenting-time schedule be modified to account for the greater distance between households, such as:

   a. Defendant to have parenting time on alternate weekends from Friday after school (or a set time on Friday evening) until Sunday at a reasonable afternoon or early evening hour, with exchanges at a mutually convenient halfway location or as otherwise ordered by the Court; and  

   b. Reasonable holiday, vacation, and summer schedules to be allocated so that the Defendant can continue to have meaningful and uninterrupted parenting time that does not disrupt Sophie’s schooling.  

34. The precise structure of the weekend and holiday parenting plan may be determined by the Court after hearing, but should be crafted with primary consideration to Sophie’s best interests, academic obligations, and emotional well‑being, as required by G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

35. The Plaintiff requests that the Court enter such further and additional orders as may be necessary to:

   a. Clarify transportation responsibilities for parenting-time exchanges;  

   b. Minimize Sophie’s travel burden on school days; and  

   c. Reduce conflict and ensure consistency in implementing the modified order.  

36. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to the specific material change in circumstances (the Defendant’s relocation and resultant long-distance midweek commuting) and is intended to promote continuity and stability for Sophie, in accordance with Massachusetts law prioritizing the child’s best interests.

                                   VI. RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and declare that since the entry of the March 15, 2020 custody and parenting-time order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable caselaw, including *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);

B. Find and declare that modification of the parenting-time schedule for the minor child, Sophie Davis, is necessary and in her best interests, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and cases including *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Murphy v. Murphy*, 380 Mass. 454 (1980); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981);

C. Order that the Plaintiff shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor child, Sophie Davis, and that legal custody shall remain as previously ordered, unless the Court finds a different allocation to be in the child’s best interests;

D. Modify the existing parenting-time provisions to eliminate the Defendant’s midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time, in light of the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting unreasonable burden on Sophie’s weekday travel and school schedule;

E. Establish a revised parenting-time schedule providing the Defendant with reasonable and meaningful parenting time primarily on alternate weekends, holidays, school vacations, and portions of the summer, structured so as not to interfere with Sophie’s regular school attendance, after-school activities, and sleep schedule;

F. Provide, in place of midweek overnights, for reasonable midweek contact between Sophie and the Defendant by in‑person dinner visits when feasible and/or electronic/virtual communication, at reasonable times and in a manner that supports Sophie’s emotional well‑being and daily routine;

G. Allocate transportation responsibilities and pick-up/drop-off locations in a manner that minimizes disruption to Sophie’s schooling and activities and reasonably accounts for the parties’ changed geographic locations;

H. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect Sophie’s best interests and to ensure that the parenting plan is practicable given the Defendant’s relocation and the child’s age, school schedule, and emotional needs.

Respectfully submitted,
