It does not discuss the scope or categories of recoverable damages (medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, etc.). Because the case never addresses what specific damages a plaintiff may recover when negligence is established, it does not support the cited damages proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In the first case, Marjorie Tuttle sought to recover for personal injuries and property damage to her automobile. The other action was by William Bowers to recover for personal injuries. ... 6. We think the instructions on the issue of control interwoven, as it was, with the issue of Bowers\u2019s contributory negligence, tended to confuse and mislead the jury. The cases having been tried together, we are of opinion that the erroneous instructions were harmful to the defendant in each of the actions. Substantial justice requires that there be a new trial in each case."
