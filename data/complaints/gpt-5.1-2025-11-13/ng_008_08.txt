### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Michael Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Quincy Bistro, LLC d/b/a Quincy Bistro (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Michael Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He may be contacted for purposes of this action at telephone number (617) 555‑0123 and email address psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Bistro, LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business as “Quincy Bistro,” operating a casual restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts 02169.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, and/or controlled the restaurant premises located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

4. At all relevant times, the employees, agents, and/or servants working at the Premises, including the server who dropped the tray and other staff who were aware of the water on the floor, were acting within the course and scope of their employment with Defendant and for Defendant’s benefit.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

6. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because Defendant is organized under the laws of Massachusetts and/or regularly conducts business within the Commonwealth, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

7. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 8, and related provisions, because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County, at the Premises located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, MA 02169.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately the dinner hour, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a paying customer and invitee of Defendant.

9. Plaintiff was seated in the dining area of Defendant’s restaurant and was eating dinner.

10. Between the kitchen and the dining room, there was a narrow interior hallway used by staff and patrons to access the restrooms and other areas of the Premises.

11. During Plaintiff’s visit, one of Defendant’s servers dropped a tray carrying several water glasses in this narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.

12. The dropped tray caused multiple water glasses to fall and shatter on the tile floor, resulting in broken glass, water, and ice on the floor surface.

13. The server promptly picked up the broken glass but left a significant amount of water and ice on the tile floor in the hallway.

14. The server stated, in substance, that she would “be right back with a mop,” indicating that she knew the floor was wet and needed to be cleaned.

15. Despite this knowledge, the server and/or other employees of Defendant failed to place any “wet floor” sign, caution cone, or other warning device in or near the hallway to warn patrons and staff of the hazardous wet condition.

16. The hallway remained open and accessible to patrons, including Plaintiff, and continued to be used as the route to the restrooms.

17. Approximately ten (10) minutes after the tray incident, Plaintiff got up from his seat to use the bathroom, walking toward and into the narrow hallway between the kitchen and dining room.

18. At that time, the hallway floor was still wet with water and/or ice from the earlier spill. No warning signs, cones, barriers, or verbal warnings were provided to Plaintiff.

19. As Plaintiff entered the hallway, the water on the tile floor created a slippery, unsafe condition. The water was glistening, but at first glance it appeared to be the normal shine of the tile floor, and Plaintiff did not realize the floor was wet until he was already stepping on it.

20. Plaintiff had no reason to suspect that the floor in this interior hallway of a restaurant would be wet and slippery, and he exercised reasonable care for his own safety.

21. As Plaintiff stepped onto the wet area, his foot slipped on the water and/or ice, causing him to lose balance and twist his knee violently.

22. Plaintiff suffered an immediate onset of pain in his knee and required assistance.

23. After Plaintiff’s fall, he overheard other staff members employed by Defendant state that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, indicating that Defendant’s employees had actual knowledge of the hazardous wet condition and that it had existed for a substantial period of time prior to Plaintiff’s injury.

24. Despite their knowledge, Defendant’s employees failed to promptly clean and dry the floor and failed to warn patrons, including Plaintiff, of the hazard.

25. As a direct and proximate result of slipping on Defendant’s wet, unmarked floor, Plaintiff suffered a sprained knee.

26. Plaintiff sought medical treatment at urgent care shortly after the incident, where he was diagnosed with a sprained knee.

27. Plaintiff was prescribed and required to use a knee brace and to attend a course of physical therapy for several weeks following the incident.

28. Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to the incident are approximately $2,500.

29. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200 in wages because his knee injury prevented him from working his normal hours and performing his usual job duties during his recovery.

30. Plaintiff experienced and continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limitations related to his knee injury.

31. Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses were directly and proximately caused by the negligence of Defendant, its employees, agents, and/or servants, in failing to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and in failing to warn of a known, dangerous condition.

---

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST QUINCY BISTRO, LLC d/b/a QUINCY BISTRO)

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 31 above as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

33. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on the Premises. As such, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect him against unreasonable risks of harm of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known.

34. Under Massachusetts law, the owner or occupier of land owes to all lawful visitors “a duty of reasonable care under all of the circumstances.” Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973).

35. That duty includes an obligation to use reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to remedy or warn of conditions posing an unreasonable risk of harm that the owner knows or should know about. See, e.g., Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 377–79 (2010).

36. Defendant, as a restaurant operator open to the public, had a specific duty to maintain walkways, aisles, and hallways in a reasonably safe condition for patrons, and to inspect those areas at reasonable intervals, to promptly clean up spills, and to warn invitees of hazards. See Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961); Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

#### Breach

37. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to promptly and adequately clean up the water and/or ice from the hallway floor after the server dropped the tray of water glasses;

   b. Leaving the hallway floor wet and slippery for at least approximately ten minutes, while patrons such as Plaintiff continued to use the hallway;

   c. Failing to place any warning signs, cones, barricades, or other visible indicators of the dangerous wet condition in the hallway;

   d. Failing to warn Plaintiff verbally of the existence of the wet and slippery condition in the hallway, despite knowing that patrons would use the hallway to access the restrooms;

   e. Allowing employees to “dodge” the puddle rather than taking reasonable steps to eliminate or adequately address the hazard, thereby permitting the dangerous condition to persist;

   f. Failing to implement and/or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the prompt cleanup and warning of spills in customer areas;

   g. Failing to adequately train, supervise, and instruct its employees and agents in the proper inspection, maintenance, and safety procedures necessary to keep floors in customer areas reasonably safe.

38. Massachusetts law recognizes that a premises owner or occupier is negligent when it knows or reasonably should know of a dangerous condition on its property and fails to take reasonable steps to remedy or warn against the condition. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 782–84 (2007); Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc., 332 Mass. 560, 562–64 (1955).

39. In this case, Defendant and its employees had actual knowledge of the puddle, as shown by:

   a. The server’s own statement that she would be “right back with a mop”; and

   b. The subsequent statements by other staff that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

40. Even if Defendant did not have actual knowledge, the condition existed for a sufficient length of time (at least approximately ten minutes) and in a location (a narrow hallway regularly used by staff) such that Defendant, exercising reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it. See Oliveri, 363 Mass. at 167–68; Deagle, 343 Mass. at 264–65.

41. Defendant’s failure to remedy or warn of the wet and slippery hallway constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts common law and the Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A, as applied in Massachusetts. See, e.g., Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 153–55 (2013) (discussing landowner liability and duty of reasonable care); Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 378–79.

#### Causation

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped on the wet, unmarked hallway floor and suffered a serious knee sprain requiring medical treatment, a brace, and physical therapy.

43. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was a substantial contributing cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. But for Defendant’s failure to clean up the spill and/or warn of the hazard, Plaintiff would not have slipped and been injured.

44. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—slip‑and‑fall injury to the knee on a wet, unmarked tile floor—is a foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of known hazards. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006) (foreseeability in negligence causation analysis); Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 638–40 (1996) (restaurant patron injured due to premises condition).

#### Damages

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Medical expenses to date in the approximate amount of $2,500 for evaluation, urgent care treatment, knee brace, and physical therapy;

   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200 due to missed work and reduced ability to perform work duties during recovery;

   c. Pain and suffering associated with the knee sprain, including physical pain, discomfort, and difficulty with walking, standing, and performing daily activities;

   d. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal activities during the period of recovery;

   e. Such additional expenses and losses as may be proven at trial, including potential future medical care if reasonably necessary.

46. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all of these damages under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85; Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 872–73 (1991); Feltch v. Gen. Rental Co., 383 Mass. 603, 613 (1981).

#### Comparative Negligence

47. Plaintiff at all relevant times exercised reasonable care for his own safety under the circumstances then existing. He had no reason to expect that the hallway floor would be wet and slippery, there were no warnings or barriers, and the water appeared at a glance to be the normal shine of the tile.

48. To the extent Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies any such allegation. In any event, under Massachusetts comparative negligence law, any negligence attributed to Plaintiff that is not greater than that of Defendant would only proportionally reduce Plaintiff’s recovery and would not bar it. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 61–62 (1988).

---

### V. PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE

49. Plaintiff respectfully notifies Defendant of its obligation to preserve all evidence potentially relevant to this incident and claim, including but not limited to:

   a. Video surveillance footage of the dining area, hallway, and surrounding areas for a reasonable period before and after Plaintiff’s fall on September 15, 2023;

   b. Incident reports, internal communications, and emails relating to the fall, the spill, or the condition of the hallway floor on that date;

   c. Maintenance and cleaning logs, policies, and procedures in effect on that date, and any training materials for employees regarding spill cleanup and floor safety;

   d. Names and contact information of all employees on duty at the time of the incident and any witnesses to the spill and/or the fall.

(This paragraph is for notice only and does not assert a separate cause of action.)
