COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT  

1. This is an action sounding in negligence arising out of an incident on March 15, 2023, at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, in which the Defendant’s unsecured aluminum extension ladder was blown over by the wind and struck the Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing property damage and consequential losses.  

2. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for repair costs, insurance deductible, loss-of-use damages including rental car costs, and other consequential damages, together with interest and costs.  

PARTIES  

3. Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Turner”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.  

4. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Michael Adams (“Defendant” or “Mr. Adams”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, in the other unit of the duplex occupied by Plaintiff, and is the owner and/or person in control of the aluminum extension ladder that caused the damage at issue.  

JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.  

6. Venue is proper in Hampden County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the parties reside in Hampden County and the events and damages giving rise to this action occurred at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.  

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. At all relevant times, Plaintiff resided in one unit of a duplex property located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (the “Property”).  

8. At all relevant times, Defendant resided in the other unit of the same duplex at the Property and shared the common driveway area with Plaintiff.  

9. The driveway at the Property is a shared, common-use area for the benefit of both Plaintiff and Defendant, including for ingress, egress, and parking their respective motor vehicles.  

10. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder (the “Ladder”).  

11. Defendant routinely stored and left the Ladder standing in a vertical and/or near-vertical position, leaning against a wooden fence bordering the shared driveway, immediately adjacent to the area where Plaintiff regularly parked her vehicle.  

12. The Ladder, due to its height, material, and configuration, presented a foreseeable risk of falling if not properly secured, particularly when exposed to wind or other environmental conditions.  

13. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff verbally expressed to Defendant her concern that the Ladder was dangerous and could fall over onto her vehicle, especially on windy days.  

14. Plaintiff specifically informed Defendant that she was worried the Ladder might topple and damage her car when she was parking, backing up, or during gusty weather.  

15. In response to Plaintiff’s concerns, Defendant acknowledged the risk and stated that he would either tie down, secure, or move the Ladder to a safer location.  

16. Despite his assurances, Defendant failed to tie down, secure, move, or otherwise make safe the Ladder, and continued to keep it leaning unsecured against the fence next to Plaintiff’s regular parking area in the shared driveway.  

17. On or about March 15, 2023, it was a windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, with gusts sufficient to cause unsecured, tall, lightweight objects to become unstable.  

18. On March 15, 2023, at approximately a time during daylight hours, Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into her usual parking spot in the shared driveway at the Property.  

19. While Plaintiff was in the process of backing into the driveway, a gust of wind struck the unsecured Ladder, causing it to fall from its leaning position against the fence.  

20. The Ladder fell directly onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking at least the hood and windshield area with substantial force.  

21. The impact caused visible dents to the hood of Plaintiff’s vehicle and caused the windshield to crack.  

22. As a direct and proximate result of the impact, Plaintiff’s vehicle required bodywork to repair the dented hood and a replacement windshield to restore the vehicle to safe and lawful operating condition.  

23. Although the vehicle remained mechanically operable, the cracked windshield rendered the vehicle unsafe and likely unlawful to operate, and it would not pass a Massachusetts vehicle inspection in that condition. See G.L. c. 90, § 7 (requiring safe condition of motor vehicles and prohibiting operation of vehicles with unsafe equipment).  

24. Plaintiff arranged for the necessary repairs to be performed by a professional auto body repair shop, which included replacement of the windshield and repair and/or repainting of the damaged hood.  

25. Plaintiff was required to pay her automobile insurance deductible out of pocket in order to obtain coverage for the repairs to her vehicle.  

26. Plaintiff’s vehicle remained in the repair shop for over one week while the necessary work was performed.  

27. During the period when her vehicle was in the shop, Plaintiff was deprived of the use of her vehicle and was required to rent a car as a substitute means of transportation.  

28. Plaintiff incurred rental car expenses and other incidental costs associated with being temporarily without her own vehicle.  

29. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s assurances that he would secure or relocate the Ladder and continued to park in her usual space in the shared driveway, as was her right as a co-occupant.  

30. At all relevant times prior to the incident, Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that leaving a tall, lightweight aluminum ladder unsecured and leaning in close proximity to a vehicle parking area in a shared driveway posed a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm, including the risk that wind would cause the ladder to fall and damage nearby property.  

31. Defendant had actual notice of the hazard because Plaintiff directly warned him on more than one occasion of the danger the Ladder posed to her vehicle.  

32. Defendant, despite such actual notice and his own acknowledgment of the risk, failed to take reasonable steps to secure, tie down, store horizontally, or otherwise reposition the Ladder to prevent it from falling into the driveway or onto Plaintiff’s vehicle.  

33. At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety and the safety of her property and did nothing to cause or contribute to the Ladder’s fall.  

34. The fall of the Ladder and resulting damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence in storing and maintaining the Ladder in an unsafe and unsecured manner in the shared driveway area.  

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage to her vehicle, incurred an insurance deductible, incurred rental car and other loss-of-use expenses while her vehicle was being repaired, and suffered inconvenience and disruption to her daily life.  

36. Plaintiff’s medical expenses were approximately $0, and she lost approximately $0 in wages, as her injuries in this incident were to property and related consequential losses rather than bodily injury.  

37. Plaintiff nonetheless suffered non-physical harms including stress, frustration, and inconvenience associated with arranging repairs, transportation, and dealing with the consequences of the damage.  

38. All damages claimed herein were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent conduct.  

LEGAL BASIS AND APPLICABLE LAW  

39. Under Massachusetts law, a person who creates or maintains a condition on property owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid subjecting others lawfully on or near the premises to an unreasonable risk of harm. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (establishing general duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).  

40. A plaintiff asserting negligence in Massachusetts must show: (1) a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) causation (both cause in fact and proximate cause); and (4) actual damages. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  

41. Foreseeability of harm is a central component of duty and proximate cause in Massachusetts negligence law. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996); *Afarian v. Mass. Elec. Co.*, 449 Mass. 257, 262–63 (2007).  

42. A defendant who has actual knowledge of a hazardous condition, particularly after being expressly warned, and fails to correct it or warn of it can be found negligent for resulting harm. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (duty to remedy known dangers); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 379 (2010) (duty of reasonable care regarding foreseeable hazards).  

43. One who controls property or instrumentalities on it owes reasonable care to prevent them from causing foreseeable damage to others, including neighboring property. See *Larkin v. Ralph O. Porter, Inc.*, 405 Mass. 179, 183 (1989) (duty based on control of property and foreseeability); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–56 (2013) (duty regarding dangerous instrumentalities and conditions).  

44. A defendant may be liable in negligence where unsecured objects or structures, left in an unsafe condition, foreseeably fall or are displaced by weather, causing injury or damage. See e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 149–50 (discussing duty regarding foreseeable misuse or movement of dangerous items); *LeBlanc v. Logan Hilton Joint Venture*, 463 Mass. 316, 325 (2012) (duty to guard against reasonably foreseeable events based on known conditions).  

45. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Massachusetts follows a comparative negligence regime, but Plaintiff was not negligent and did not contribute to the hazard created by Defendant.  

46. Damage to property and loss-of-use damages are recoverable as part of negligence damages in Massachusetts when proximately caused by the defendant’s breach of duty. See *Hopkins v. Medeiros*, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 613–14 (2000) (recognizing compensation for reasonably foreseeable consequential damages); see also *Guaranty-First Trust Co. v. Textron, Inc.*, 416 Mass. 332, 336–37 (1993).  

47. Plaintiff may recover interest on any judgment under G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions) and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 261, §§ 1 et seq.  

COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  

48. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 47 as if fully set forth herein.  

49. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, placement, and storage of the Ladder, and in the maintenance and use of the shared driveway area at the Property. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. at 707 (general duty of reasonable care); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146–47.  

50. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that leaving the Ladder tall, upright, and unsecured against a fence immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area in a shared driveway created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk that the Ladder could topple, particularly during windy conditions, and strike persons or property, including Plaintiff’s vehicle. See *Poskus*, 423 Mass. at 639–40; *Afarian*, 449 Mass. at 262–63.  

51. Defendant had actual notice of the specific risk that the Ladder could fall and damage Plaintiff’s vehicle because Plaintiff informed him on multiple occasions of her concerns about the Ladder falling over, especially on windy days. See *Oliveri*, 363 Mass. at 167–68.  

52. Defendant expressly acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and represented that he would secure, tie down, or move the Ladder to reduce or eliminate the risk, thereby further confirming his awareness of the hazard.  

53. Despite his knowledge of the danger and his assurances, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to secure, tie down, lay flat, move to a sheltered location, or otherwise safely store the Ladder.  

54. A reasonably prudent person, knowing what Defendant knew and under the circumstances existing at the Property, would have foreseen that a tall, lightweight aluminum ladder, left upright and unsecured next to an area where vehicles regularly park, could be blown over by a gust of wind and damage a nearby vehicle or injure a person. See *LeBlanc*, 463 Mass. at 325; *Dos Santos*, 465 Mass. at 154–56.  

55. Defendant’s conduct in failing to secure or safely store the Ladder, and in continuing to leave it upright and leaning against the fence next to Plaintiff’s parking area, constituted a breach of his duty of reasonable care. See *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 707; *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 379.  

56. On March 15, 2023, a gust of wind caused the unsecured Ladder to fall from its leaning position against the fence and strike Plaintiff’s vehicle, resulting directly from Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the Ladder.  

57. But for Defendant’s negligent storage and maintenance of the Ladder, the Ladder would not have fallen onto Plaintiff’s vehicle and Plaintiff’s vehicle would not have sustained damage.  

58. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor, and the proximate cause, of the property damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle and Plaintiff’s consequential losses, including loss of use and rental car expenses. See *Glidden*, 430 Mass. at 696 (causation element).  

59. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the Ladder’s fall and exercised reasonable care in operating and parking her vehicle in the shared driveway, a use reasonably to be expected and known by Defendant.  

60. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Physical damage to her vehicle, including but not limited to the dented hood and cracked windshield;  
    b. Out-of-pocket payment of an automobile insurance deductible for the cost of repairs;  
    c. Loss of use of her vehicle for more than one week while it was in the repair shop;  
    d. Rental car expenses and related transportation costs incurred while her vehicle was unavailable; and  
    e. Inconvenience, stress, and disruption to her daily life associated with arranging repairs, alternative transportation, and dealing with the consequences of the incident.  

61. All of the above damages were reasonably foreseeable results of Defendant’s negligent conduct in failing to secure or relocate the Ladder, particularly in light of Plaintiff’s repeated warnings. See *Hopkins*, 48 Mass. App. Ct. at 613–14; *Guaranty-First Trust Co.*, 416 Mass. at 336–37.  

62. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the Court or a jury, together with statutory prejudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 261, §§ 1 et seq.

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on Count I (Negligence);
