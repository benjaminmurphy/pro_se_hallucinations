It does not address joint legal custody, co\u2011parenting dynamics, or any requirement under Massachusetts law that effective cooperation is a prerequisite for joint decision\u2011making. The cited text concerns removal/relocation and the timing/status of legal parentage, not breakdowns in joint custody due to disparagement or blame\u2011shifting.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe Yannas factors apply to prevent one legal parent from unilaterally relocating with a child to another jurisdiction, thereby affecting the parental rights of the other legal parent. That analysis is triggered only where the rights of two legal parents have been established prior to removal or attempted removal of the child from Massachusetts. \u2026 This is not a removal case, and Yannas is inapposite.\u201d"
