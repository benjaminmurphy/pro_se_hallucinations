v.  

JAMES SMITH,  
    Defendant / Respondent.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME ORDER
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, James Smith (“Defendant” or “Father”), and states as follows:

                                    I. PARTIES

1.    The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Emily Smith (date of birth: __________, age 10) and Lucas Smith (date of birth: __________, age 8) (collectively, “the Children”).

2.    The Defendant, James Smith, is an individual believed to reside in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3.    The Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the Children pursuant to a Judgment of the Bristol Probate and Family Court dated June 15, 2021 (“2021 Judgment”).

4.    The Defendant exercises parenting time pursuant to the 2021 Judgment, consisting of alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

                           II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.    This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6, and applicable provisions of G.L. c. 208 and/or G.L. c. 209C (as applicable to the underlying judgment), as this Court issued the existing custody and parenting time order concerning the Children on June 15, 2021.

6.    The Children have resided in Massachusetts at all relevant times, and Massachusetts is their home state within the meaning of the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction statutes and the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738A.

7.    Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court because this Court entered the 2021 Judgment and the parties and the Children reside within its jurisdiction.

8.    This Complaint is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as applicable), which authorizes the Court to modify custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where such modification is in the best interests of the child.

                         III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

9.    On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (or Judgment of Divorce / Judgment of Paternity / Parenting Judgment, as applicable) which, among other things:

      a.    Awarded the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the Children; and  

      b.    Provided the Defendant parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit (the “Current Parenting Schedule”).

10.   At the time the 2021 Judgment was entered, neither parent was in a serious relationship, and the Judgment contains no provisions addressing exposure of the Children to new romantic partners, cohabitants, or other third parties in the parents’ homes.

11.   The 2021 Judgment has remained in effect without modification to custody or parenting time since June 15, 2021.

        IV. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12.   Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the safety and best interests of the Children.

13.   Specifically, the Defendant now resides with an adult individual (hereinafter, “the Cohabitant”) who:

      a.    Has a criminal record, including at least one conviction for assault and battery; and  

      b.    Previously had a restraining order (abuse prevention order) issued against him/her by a former intimate partner.

14.   The Defendant’s cohabitation with the Cohabitant, who has a documented history of violence and court-involved abusive behavior, did not exist and was not contemplated at the time of the 2021 Judgment, and therefore represents a material change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 28; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (material change in circumstances standard); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 599–600 (1996).

15.   The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that, during parenting time with the Defendant at his residence, the Cohabitant:

      a.    Frequently yells, raises his/her voice, and engages in loud and aggressive verbal outbursts;  

      b.    Slams doors and displays volatile, intimidating behavior; and  

      c.    On at least one occasion, grabbed one of the Children with sufficient force to leave a visible mark on the Child’s arm.

16.   The Plaintiff is informed and believes that a neighbor contacted the police during a loud argument involving the Cohabitant while the Children were present in the home, demonstrating the volatility and potential danger of the environment to which the Children are exposed during the Defendant’s parenting time.

17.   The Plaintiff is informed and believes that the Defendant continues to allow the Cohabitant to be present during his parenting time with the Children, notwithstanding the Cohabitant’s criminal history and the Children’s reports of frightening and physically aggressive behavior.

18.   The existence of a cohabiting partner with a prior assault-and-battery conviction, a history of abuse prevention orders, and ongoing volatile and aggressive conduct toward or in the presence of the Children constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances adversely affecting the Children’s welfare, safety, and emotional well-being.

19.   Massachusetts courts have long recognized that exposure of minor children to domestic violence, abuse, or a household environment marked by aggression and volatility is a critical factor in custody and parenting-time determinations. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Benjamin, 403 Mass. 24 (1988).

20.   The Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement provisions and general Massachusetts family law mandate that the child’s best interests are paramount in any parenting-time determination. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; G.L. c. 208, § 31; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 709–10 (1985); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 547–48 (2010).

21.   Under G.L. c. 208, § 31A, and related jurisprudence, the Court must give particular weight to evidence of past or present abuse, the safety and well-being of the child, and the safety of the abused parent, and must fashion custody and visitation arrangements that do not expose the child to a substantial risk of harm. See also Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

22.   The reports from the Children that the Cohabitant “yells a lot,” “slams doors,” and once “grabbed” a Child hard enough to leave a mark, combined with the Cohabitant’s criminal record and prior abuse prevention order, establish a serious concern that the Children may be exposed to physical and emotional harm during the Defendant’s parenting time.

23.   The police involvement following a loud argument at the Defendant’s residence while the Children were present further underscores the instability and potential danger in the environment to which the Children are subjected during visits.

24.   Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that a child’s environment, including exposure to violent or abusive individuals in the household, is a critical factor in the best-interests analysis and can warrant modification of custody or parenting time. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (stability and safety central to best interests); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232, 234–35 (1981).

25.   Since the 2021 Judgment, the Defendant’s decision to reside with, and expose the Children to, a cohabitant with a documented history of violence and current volatile behavior constitutes a “changed circumstance” under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

26.   The changed circumstances described above directly implicate the Children’s safety, physical integrity, and emotional health, and therefore go to the heart of the best-interests analysis. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–44; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

27.   The Plaintiff is not seeking to eliminate the Defendant’s relationship with the Children, but to ensure that the Children’s contact with the Defendant occurs in an environment free from significant risk of physical or emotional harm, consistent with the best-interests standard.

28.   The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific safety concerns posed by the Cohabitant’s presence, while preserving the Defendant’s opportunity for ongoing contact and a relationship with the Children, as appropriate.

29.   For these reasons, and consistent with Massachusetts law, a modification of the Current Parenting Schedule and conditions of parenting time is necessary and in the Children’s best interests.

                      V. APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL STANDARD

30.   Under G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as may be applicable), a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time order upon a showing that (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the prior judgment, and (2) the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See also G.L. c. 215, § 6.

31.   Massachusetts case law consistently applies this two-part test. See, e.g.:

      a.    Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (material and substantial change required for modification of custody);  

      b.    Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996) (best interests standard, especially where abuse or violence is present);  

      c.    Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 842–44 (2003) (focus on child’s stability, safety, and overall welfare);  

      d.    Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 765–66 (1983) (best interests of child is paramount consideration);  

      e.    Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232, 234–35 (1981) (court must consider risk of harm to child);  

      f.    Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (modification may be warranted where circumstances affecting child’s welfare have changed);  

      g.    Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261–63 (2001) (safety and emotional security are key elements of best interests).

32.   Massachusetts statutes further require that in any custody or visitation proceeding where abuse is alleged, the Court must consider evidence of abuse and the safety of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A (requiring courts to consider the effects of abuse in custody determinations); see also G.L. c. 209A (abuse prevention).

33.   Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must consider, among other factors, the past and present living conditions of each parent, the child’s relationship with each parent, and the capacity of each parent to provide a safe, stable, and nurturing environment.

34.   The presence in a custodial or visitation household of a person with a history of violence, abuse, or criminal conduct, and evidence that such person has acted aggressively or frighteningly toward or in the presence of the child, is a factor that the Court may and should consider in determining the best interests of the child and the appropriate conditions on parenting time. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44.

35.   The Plaintiff’s requested relief—namely, restricting the Cohabitant’s presence during visits, or in the alternative, ordering supervised parenting time—falls squarely within the Court’s equitable powers to protect the best interests and safety of the Children. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; G.L. c. 215, § 6; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26.

                     VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

36.   The Children are of tender ages (approximately 10 and 8) and are impressionable and vulnerable to emotional and physical harm.

37.   The Children have reported feeling uncomfortable and frightened by the Cohabitant’s behavior, including yelling, door-slamming, and physically grabbing one Child hard enough to leave a mark.

38.   The Children’s sense of safety, security, and emotional well-being is compromised when exposed to volatile and aggressive behavior in the Defendant’s home.

39.   The existence of a prior assault-and-battery conviction and an abuse prevention order against the Cohabitant from a former intimate partner is strongly indicative of a pattern of violence and abusive conduct, which exacerbates the risk to the Children.

40.   In light of these circumstances, the Children’s best interests and safety are best served by:

      a.    Prohibiting the Cohabitant from being present during the Defendant’s parenting time with the Children; or, if the Defendant chooses to continue residing with the Cohabitant or otherwise cannot ensure the Cohabitant’s absence,  

      b.    Requiring that the Defendant’s parenting time occur under professional supervision at an appropriate supervised visitation center or other arrangement approved by the Court.

41.   Such relief would allow the Children to maintain a relationship with the Defendant while substantially reducing the risk of exposure to violence, aggression, and emotional harm.

42.   The requested modification is consistent with the statutory and common-law obligation of the Court to prioritize the Children’s safety and best interests above all other considerations. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–44; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

43.   Maintaining the Current Parenting Schedule without any restrictions or supervision, in light of the changed circumstances and documented risks, would be contrary to the Children’s best interests.

44.   For these reasons, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2021 Judgment as set forth below.

                             VII. REQUESTED RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1.    Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2021 Judgment, specifically including, but not limited to:

      a.    The Defendant’s cohabitation with an individual who has a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order (abuse prevention order) issued by a former intimate partner; and  

      b.    The Cohabitant’s volatile, aggressive, and physically intrusive behavior toward or in the presence of the Children, including yelling, slamming doors, and grabbing one Child hard enough to leave a mark, as well as the involvement of police during a loud argument when the Children were present.

2.    Find and rule that, in light of these changed circumstances, modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary to protect the Children’s safety and to serve their best interests, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (as applicable); and governing case law, including but not limited to Custody of Kali, Custody of Vaughn, Bouchard v. Bouchard, and related authorities.

3.    Modify the June 15, 2021 Judgment to provide that:

      a.    The Plaintiff shall continue to have primary physical custody of the Children; and  

      b.    The Defendant’s parenting time shall be subject to the following conditions:

            i.     The Cohabitant (or any person with a similar history of assaultive or abusive behavior) shall not be present in the home or otherwise have contact with the Children during any of the Defendant’s parenting time;  

            ii.    The Defendant shall not permit the Cohabitant to reside in, stay overnight in, or visit the premises during his parenting time with the Children; and  

            iii.   The Defendant shall promptly notify the Plaintiff and the Court of any change in his living arrangements that would involve the Children’s exposure to any new adult household member.

4.    In the alternative, if the Defendant continues to reside with the Cohabitant or fails or is unable to ensure that the Cohabitant will not be present during his parenting time, order that:

      a.    The Defendant’s parenting time be supervised at a court-approved supervised visitation center or by a professional supervisor approved by the Court;  

      b.    The frequency, duration, and conditions of supervised visits be set by the Court consistent with the Children’s best interests and safety; and  

      c.    The Court retain jurisdiction to review and adjust the supervised visitation arrangements upon a further showing of changed circumstances and evidence that the Children’s safety and emotional well-being can be adequately protected.

5.    Issue any temporary orders necessary to protect the Children pending a full hearing on this Complaint, including but not limited to:

      a.    Temporary prohibition of the Cohabitant’s contact with the Children;  

      b.    Temporary supervised parenting time for the Defendant; and  

      c.    Any other interim relief the Court deems appropriate to safeguard the Children.

6.    Order that all future exchanges of the Children for parenting time occur in a safe and neutral setting, if the Court deems necessary for the Children’s emotional and physical safety.

7.    Award the Plaintiff such further and additional relief, both legal and equitable, as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests and safety of the Children.

                                           Respectfully submitted,  
                                           PLAINTIFF,
