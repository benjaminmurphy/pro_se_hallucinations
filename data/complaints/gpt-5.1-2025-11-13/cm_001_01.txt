v.

Docket No. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time judgment, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, is an adult resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is:  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Father”), upon information and belief, is an adult resident of Bristol County, Massachusetts and is the father of the minor children Emma Thompson (date of birth: ____________, age 8) and Liam Thompson (date of birth: ____________, age 6) (collectively, the “children”).

3. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this matter concerns modification of a prior custody and parenting time judgment of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior judgment was entered in this Court and the minor children reside within this Court’s jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 208, § 6; G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT

5. On or about March 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor children (the “2021 Judgment”).

6. Under the 2021 Judgment, the Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody of the children, with shared or allocated legal custody as set forth in that Judgment (hereinafter “primary custody” for the Plaintiff), and the Defendant was granted parenting time consisting of:

   a. Parenting time with the children on alternating weekends; and  

   b. One overnight parenting time visit during the week (the “weekday overnight”), on a schedule established in the 2021 Judgment or by the parties’ agreement consistent with that Judgment.

7. At the time the 2021 Judgment was entered, both parties worked regular daytime work schedules, and the overnight parenting time arrangement for the Defendant was based on the expectation that the Defendant would be awake, available, and able to personally care for the children during his parenting time.

8. The 2021 Judgment remains in full force and effect and has not previously been modified.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the children and the parenting schedule, particularly the Defendant’s work schedule and his ability to provide safe, consistent overnight care.

10. Specifically, upon information and belief, the Defendant has recently accepted or begun working a new job that regularly requires him to work night shifts from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights on which he is scheduled for overnight parenting time pursuant to the 2021 Judgment.

11. As a direct result of this new overnight work schedule, the Defendant is frequently unable to personally care for the children during the scheduled overnights and has either:

   a. Returned the children to the Plaintiff’s home with little or no advance notice because he is too tired to care for them; or  

   b. Left the children in the care of a roommate or other third party whom the Plaintiff does not know well and has not agreed to as an overnight caregiver.

12. On multiple occasions, the Defendant has contacted the Plaintiff on short notice, including on the same day or evening, stating that he is either working an overnight shift or is too exhausted from work to care for the children and therefore must drop them off early or cannot exercise his scheduled overnight parenting time.

13. On other occasions, the children have reported to the Plaintiff that during visits with the Defendant, they have been left with the Defendant’s roommate, who is essentially a stranger to the Plaintiff, or they have been unsupervised while the Defendant sleeps, sometimes falling asleep on the couch while the Defendant naps.

14. The children’s reports include that the Defendant, after working overnight shifts, is extremely tired when he is scheduled to have parenting time, and that he often naps or sleeps for significant periods while they are in his care, leaving them without adequate, attentive supervision.

15. The Defendant’s new overnight work schedule and resulting exhaustion substantially interfere with his ability to safely and appropriately exercise overnight parenting time on a predictable basis as contemplated by the 2021 Judgment.

16. The original parenting schedule was created with the understanding and assumption that each parent would personally be available during his or her parenting time to supervise, care for, and attend to the children, particularly during overnight visits.

17. The Defendant’s new work schedule, his repeated last‑minute changes, and his reliance on an unfamiliar roommate for overnight childcare constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not contemplated at the time of the 2021 Judgment.

18. This change has resulted in instability and unpredictability in the children’s routine and has caused them stress and confusion regarding where they will be sleeping and who will be caring for them at night.

19. The Plaintiff has repeatedly accommodated the Defendant’s last‑minute schedule changes in order to protect the children’s safety and avoid leaving them with unfamiliar or potentially inappropriate caregivers, but this situation is no longer workable or in the children’s best interests.

20. The Defendant’s pattern of:

   a. Returning the children to the Plaintiff’s home with minimal notice;  

   b. Leaving the children with a roommate or other third party overnight; and  

   c. Being too tired to adequately supervise the children after overnight shifts  

   has created ongoing concerns for the children’s safety, well‑being, and emotional security.

21. The children are of young ages (Emma, age 8, and Liam, age 6) and require consistent, attentive supervision, regular sleep routines, and a stable, predictable caregiving environment, especially overnight.

22. The Plaintiff is willing and able to provide consistent overnight care and a stable environment on any night when the Defendant is working overnight or is otherwise not reasonably able to stay awake and supervise the children.

23. The Plaintiff does not seek to eliminate the Defendant’s relationship with the children and continues to support appropriate, safe, and meaningful parenting time for the Defendant. She seeks a modification solely to ensure that overnight parenting time occurs only when the Defendant is actually off work, available, and in a position to provide safe, attentive care.

24. In light of these developments, the existing parenting schedule no longer serves the children’s best interests and must be modified to reflect the Defendant’s current work schedule and the children’s need for safety, stability, and consistent overnight care.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD

25. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6.

26. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all custody and parenting time determinations and modifications in Massachusetts. See, e.g., Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003).

27. The Probate and Family Court has broad equitable authority to modify custody and parenting time when a significant change in the parties’ or children’s circumstances renders the existing judgment no longer consonant with the children’s best interests. See Delmolino v. Nance, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 210–11 (1982); G.L. c. 215, § 6.

28. A significant change in a parent’s work schedule that undermines the existing parenting time arrangement, particularly as to overnight care and supervision, may constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances justifying modification. See generally Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 265 (2001) (upholding modification based on post‑judgment changes affecting parenting plan and child’s welfare); Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981) (post‑judgment changes in circumstances warranting modification).

29. Massachusetts appellate decisions emphasize the importance of stability and predictability for children, while recognizing that “the passage of time and attendant changes in the life situation of the parties and the child” may require modification. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; see also Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243–44 (2000).

30. The Court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the children’s ages, their need for a stable routine, the safety and quality of each parent’s care, and each parent’s ability to meet the children’s daily needs. See Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981); Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406, 409–10 (1976).

31. The Court also has the authority to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time to safeguard the children’s welfare, including tailoring overnights to times when a parent is actually available and able to provide adequate supervision. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 546–47 (2010) (courts may place conditions on parenting time to protect children’s welfare); Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232, 234–35 (1981) (similar).

32. Massachusetts law recognizes that the use of third‑party caregivers may be relevant to a child’s best interests, especially when it results in instability, insufficient supervision, or exposure to individuals not vetted by the other parent or the Court. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996) (considering safety, stability, and quality of care in custody decisions); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998) (emphasizing the paramount concern for safety and well‑being of children).

33. Where, as here, a parent’s changed work schedule substantially disrupts the parenting plan, leads to last‑minute changes and third‑party care at night, and undermines the stability and safety of overnight care, the Court has both the authority and the obligation to modify the parenting schedule to protect the children’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Rosenthal, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 265.

### V. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

34. The Defendant’s new overnight work schedule and pattern of conduct since the 2021 Judgment constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances because:

   a. The Defendant is now frequently unavailable to personally supervise the children during scheduled overnight parenting time due to his 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. work hours;  

   b. The Defendant has repeatedly changed or canceled overnight parenting time with little notice, causing instability and uncertainty for the children; and  

   c. The Defendant has resorted to leaving the children with a roommate or otherwise unsupervised while he sleeps, raising legitimate concerns regarding the adequacy and safety of overnight care.

35. These circumstances were not contemplated by the Court or by the parties at the time of the 2021 Judgment, which was entered when both parties worked daytime schedules and were expected to personally provide care during their parenting time.

36. The current overnight arrangement in practice is no longer consistent with the children’s best interests, given their ages and needs for safety, supervision, and a predictable routine.

37. The children’s reports that they are left with a roommate they do not know well, or that they fall asleep on the couch while their father naps or sleeps, indicate that the overnight parenting schedule as currently implemented does not reliably provide appropriate, attentive nighttime supervision.

38. The Plaintiff is not seeking to diminish the Defendant’s relationship with the children, but to ensure that overnights occur only when the Defendant is actually off work and able to remain awake and responsible for the children’s care throughout the evening and night.

39. A modification that limits overnights to times when the Defendant is not working, and that formalizes the Plaintiff’s care of the children on other nights, will:

   a. Promote stability and predictability for the children;  

   b. Ensure that the children are consistently with an available, awake, and responsible adult overnight;  

   c. Reduce the children’s stress and uncertainty regarding last‑minute schedule changes; and  

   d. Better align the parenting plan with the children’s best interests as required by Massachusetts law.

40. Accordingly, the statutory and common‑law standards for modification—material change in circumstances and best interests of the children—are met. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Rosenthal, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 265; Yannas, 395 Mass. at 711; Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 243–44.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

41. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2021 Judgment as to custody and parenting time to reflect the Defendant’s changed work schedule and to protect the children’s best interests, specifically including but not limited to the following:

   a. That the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, continue to have primary physical custody of the minor children;  

   b. That the existing parenting time schedule be modified so that the Defendant’s overnight parenting time occurs only on nights when the Defendant is not scheduled to work an overnight (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. or similar) shift and when he is reasonably able to be awake and available to personally care for the children;  

   c. That on any night when the Defendant is scheduled to work an overnight shift, or reasonably anticipates that he will be too exhausted to provide adequate overnight supervision, the children shall remain in the Plaintiff’s care overnight, with the Plaintiff providing their primary nighttime care;  

   d. That the Defendant be required to provide reasonable advance written or electronic notice (e.g., 48–72 hours when possible) to the Plaintiff of his overnight work schedule and any changes that affect his ability to exercise scheduled overnights, so that appropriate arrangements for the children can be made;  

   e. That the Defendant not leave the children overnight in the sole care of roommates or other unrelated third parties without the Plaintiff’s written agreement or further order of the Court, except in a true emergency, in which case the Defendant shall promptly notify the Plaintiff;  

   f. That the parties be ordered to cooperate in developing a specific, written parenting time schedule that:  

      i. Identifies which weekends and weekday evenings the Defendant is off work and available for overnights;  
      ii. Ensures that, absent emergency, the children are with a parent (not an unvetted third party) for overnight care; and  
      iii. May include additional non‑overnight parenting time (such as supper visits or daytime visits) for the Defendant to maintain a strong relationship with the children without compromising their safety or sleep routines; and  

   g. That the Court enter any additional or alternative orders as it deems just and proper to protect the children’s best interests and to align the parenting schedule with the Defendant’s current work schedule.

42. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court confirm that all provisions of the 2021 Judgment not inconsistent with any new modification order remain in full force and effect.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the March 15, 2021 Judgment, specifically relating to the Defendant’s overnight work schedule, his ability to provide safe and consistent overnight care, and the resulting instability in the children’s routines;

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor children, Emma and Liam;

C. Issue a Modified Judgment providing that:

   1. The Plaintiff shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor children (with legal custody to remain as previously ordered unless otherwise modified by the Court);  

   2. The Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall be limited to nights when he is not scheduled to work an overnight shift and is reasonably able to remain awake and personally supervise and care for the children;  

   3. On nights when the Defendant is scheduled to work overnight or is otherwise unable to provide adequate overnight supervision, the children shall be in the Plaintiff’s overnight care;  

   4. The Defendant shall provide reasonable advance notice of his overnight work schedule and any changes that affect his ability to exercise scheduled overnight parenting time;  

   5. The Defendant shall not leave the children overnight with roommates or other third parties without the Plaintiff’s agreement or further order of the Court, except in a true emergency, in which case he shall promptly notify the Plaintiff;  

   6. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to implement a specific, written parenting schedule consistent with the above terms, including consideration of appropriate non‑overnight parenting time for the Defendant; and  

   7. All provisions of the prior Judgment not inconsistent with the Modified Judgment shall remain in full force and effect;

D. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LAURA JOHNSON,  
pro se
