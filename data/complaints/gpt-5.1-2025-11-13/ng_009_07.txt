    Plaintiff,

v.

LYNN APARTMENTS, LLC,  
    Defendant.


COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)


Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartments, LLC (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing on the third floor of an apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts 01905.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Lynn Apartments, LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted by and through its officers, members, managers, agents, employees, and/or other persons acting within the course and scope of their actual or apparent authority.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action sounding in negligence for personal injury and related damages arising out of a fire that occurred on or about September 15, 2023, at the Premises located in Lynn, Massachusetts.

5. The Lynn District Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 & 8, because the cause of action arose in Essex County, at the Premises located in Lynn, Massachusetts, and Defendant owns and operates real property in this county.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. At all times relevant, Plaintiff was a lawful residential tenant of an apartment unit on the third floor of the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.

8. Defendant, as the owner and landlord of the Premises, owed a duty to Plaintiff and other tenants to maintain the common areas, including the common hallways and common‑area smoke detectors, in a reasonably safe condition and in compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, and fire and building codes.

9. The common hallway outside Plaintiff’s third‑floor apartment was equipped with a smoke detector that, for several months prior to September 15, 2023, emitted intermittent “chirping” noises indicative of a low battery.

10. Eventually, an unknown individual removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit, apparently to silence the chirping, and left the battery sitting on a nearby windowsill.

11. After the battery was removed, the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was rendered non‑functional and was unable to provide any audible alarm in the event of fire or smoke.

12. Plaintiff, recognizing the danger of having a non‑functioning smoke detector in the common hallway, notified Defendant on at least three separate occasions over a period of months that (a) the detector had been chirping due to low battery, and (b) the battery had been removed and the detector was not working.

13. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant’s representatives repeatedly assured Plaintiff that Defendant would “take care of it,” thereby acknowledging both Plaintiff’s reports and Defendant’s responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the hallway smoke detector.

14. Despite these assurances and despite having actual notice of the inoperable smoke detector, Defendant failed to repair or replace the battery, failed to replace the smoke detector, and otherwise failed to restore the hallway smoke detector to proper operating condition.

15. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment persisted for a substantial period of time prior to September 15, 2023.

16. On or about September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first‑floor apartment of the Premises, reportedly originating in the kitchen area.

17. At the time of the fire, the common hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s third‑floor apartment remained in a non‑functional condition, without any battery installed.

18. Because the hallway smoke detector was non‑functional and had no power source, it did not activate or sound any alarm in response to the smoke and fire that developed on the first floor and spread through the building.

19. Had the common hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment been in proper working order with a functioning battery, it would have detected smoke and/or fire and provided an earlier audible alarm to Plaintiff.

20. Plaintiff received no early warning from a hallway smoke detector. Instead, Plaintiff first became aware that something was wrong only upon smelling smoke inside her apartment.

21. By the time Plaintiff realized that there was smoke, smoke from the fire had already thickened in the third‑floor hallway outside her unit.

22. When Plaintiff opened her door to exit, she encountered heavy smoke in the common hallway that made it difficult to see and caused immediate difficulty breathing.

23. Plaintiff was forced to navigate through the smoke‑filled hallway and stairwell to escape the building, during which she inhaled a significant quantity of smoke.

24. As a direct result of her exposure to smoke, Plaintiff experienced acute respiratory distress and other symptoms consistent with smoke inhalation.

25. Plaintiff was transported for emergency medical evaluation and treatment and was hospitalized overnight for smoke inhalation.

26. Plaintiff’s injuries included, but were not limited to, smoke inhalation, difficulty breathing, respiratory irritation, and associated pain, suffering, anxiety, and distress.

27. Plaintiff incurred approximately $10,500 in medical expenses related to her evaluation, treatment, and follow‑up care.

28. Plaintiff also lost approximately $2,000 in wages because her injuries and symptoms rendered her temporarily unable to work.

29. In addition, Plaintiff’s personal property inside her apartment, including furniture, clothing, electronics, and other belongings, sustained significant damage due to smoke and water from fire‑suppression efforts.

30. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer property damage, inconvenience, loss of use and enjoyment of her home and belongings, and emotional distress arising from the fire and the circumstances of her escape.

31. At all times material hereto, Defendant had actual knowledge, based on Plaintiff’s repeated reports, that the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment was not functioning and lacked a battery.

32. Alternatively, and/or in addition, Defendant, through the exercise of reasonable care and periodic inspection as required by law and by the standard of care for landlords, would have discovered that the hallway smoke detector was not operable well before the fire on September 15, 2023.

33. Defendant failed to perform reasonable inspections, failed to replace the missing battery, failed to test and maintain the smoke detector, and otherwise failed to ensure that the common hallway smoke detector complied with applicable safety standards.

34. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector in the common hallway violated its common‑law duty of reasonable care, its statutory and regulatory duties under Massachusetts law, and its obligations as a landlord to provide reasonably safe common areas for tenants.

35. The injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiff were the foreseeable and direct result of Defendant’s negligent omission in failing to maintain, repair, and/or replace the common hallway smoke detector, despite clear notice and opportunity to do so.

### IV. APPLICABLE DUTIES, STATUTES, AND REGULATIONS

36. Massachusetts law imposes upon landlords and property owners a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain common areas in a reasonably safe condition for tenants and lawful visitors. See, e.g., *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing distinction between invitees and licensees and recognizing duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (landowner owes duty of reasonable care to all lawful entrants).

37. Landlords are liable for injuries resulting from their failure to keep common areas in as safe a condition as that in which they were, or appeared to be, at the start of the tenancy, and must use reasonable care to protect tenants against foreseeable risks. See *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); *Humphrey v. Byron*, 447 Mass. 322 (2006).

38. Negligence under Massachusetts law consists of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, a breach of that duty, causation (both cause‑in‑fact and proximate cause), and actual damages. See *Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000).

39. Plaintiff was a foreseeable member of the class of persons to be protected by the fire safety statutes and regulations governing smoke detectors in residential buildings. See *Carter v. Yardley & Co.*, 319 Mass. 92 (1946) (foreseeability and protective purpose of safety statutes); *MacDonald v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.*, 394 Mass. 131 (1985) (duty arising from foreseeability of harm).

40. Massachusetts statutes and regulations require landlords to install and maintain working smoke detectors in residential buildings, including in common areas such as hallways.

41. Pursuant to G.L. c. 148, § 26F, and related provisions, certain residential buildings must be equipped with approved smoke detectors in accordance with regulations promulgated by the State Fire Marshal and applicable building and fire codes.

42. The Massachusetts State Building Code (780 CMR), as in effect at the relevant time, and the State Fire Code (527 CMR and now 527 CMR 1.00), require the installation and maintenance of smoke detection systems in multifamily dwellings, including in common hallways, and require that such systems be kept in proper working order.

43. G.L. c. 143, § 3 and G.L. c. 148, §§ 26A‑26F place duties on building owners to comply with fire safety provisions and authorize enforcement of requirements concerning smoke detectors and other life‑safety systems.

44. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s violation of statutes and regulations designed to protect tenants’ safety, including fire and building codes, constitutes evidence of negligence and may support liability where such violation is causally related to the plaintiff’s injury. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358‑59 (1990); *St. Germaine v. Pendergast*, 411 Mass. 615, 620 (1992).

45. Massachusetts law also obligates landlords to maintain residential premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A‑127L; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. The duty to maintain safe egress and fire‑safety systems is part of the landlord’s obligation to keep the premises “fit for human habitation.” See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); *Hemingway v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

46. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment constituted a breach of these duties and a deviation from the standard of care owed under Massachusetts law to tenants in multifamily buildings.

47. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that disabling or failing to maintain a common hallway smoke detector could result in delayed warning of a fire, increased exposure of tenants to smoke and fire, and serious personal injuries, including smoke inhalation.

48. Defendant’s negligent omissions created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff that manifested in the injuries and damages she suffered on September 15, 2023.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

49. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 48 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

50. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including the common hallways and smoke detection devices, in a reasonably safe condition and in compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and codes.

51. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to inspect, maintain, repair, and replace smoke detectors in the common areas, and to ensure that they were in proper working order, with appropriate power sources, including functional batteries where applicable.

52. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to respond reasonably and in a timely manner to notice of defective or non‑operational safety equipment, including the hallway smoke detector whose battery had been removed.

53. Defendant had actual notice that the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment was not functioning and had no battery, based on Plaintiff’s multiple reports and Defendant’s own assurances that it would “take care of it.”

54. Alternatively, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazard because, through the exercise of reasonable care and periodic inspections as required by law and by standard property‑management practices, Defendant would have discovered that the common hallway smoke detector was inoperable.

55. Despite such actual and/or constructive notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to repair or replace the missing battery, failed to test and restore the smoke detector to working order, and failed to otherwise ensure that the common hallway smoke detector functioned as required.

56. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, including but not limited to the failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit and failure to timely correct a known life‑safety hazard, constituted a breach of its duty of care.

57. Defendant’s breaches of duty were further evidenced by its violations of applicable fire, building, and sanitary codes, including but not limited to G.L. c. 148, § 26F, G.L. c. 143, § 3, G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A‑127L, and the implementing regulations at 780 CMR, 527 CMR, and 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.

58. Defendant’s breaches were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

59. Had the common hallway smoke detector been properly maintained and functioning with a working battery on September 15, 2023, it would have sounded an alarm upon detecting smoke from the first‑floor fire, providing Plaintiff with earlier notice and an opportunity to evacuate before the hallway became filled with heavy smoke.

60. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff did not receive any such early warning and instead encountered a hallway that was already thick with smoke, causing her to inhale large quantities of smoke while attempting to escape.

61. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s smoke inhalation, hospitalization, medical bills, lost wages, and property damage.

62. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, including but not limited to smoke inhalation and breathing difficulties, which required emergency medical treatment and overnight hospitalization.

63. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $10,500 and reasonably anticipates additional medical expenses in the future.

64. Plaintiff lost wages in the approximate amount of $2,000 due to her inability to work while recovering from her injuries.

65. Plaintiff sustained damage to personal property as a result of smoke and water damage, including damage to furniture, clothing, electronics, household items, and other belongings, in an amount to be determined at trial.

66. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life as a direct consequence of Defendant’s negligence and the traumatic circumstances of the fire and her evacuation.

67. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages proximately caused by its negligence. See, e.g., *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540 (1982); *Poole v. Classic Yacht Co.*, 396 Mass. 1 (1985).

68. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant all compensatory damages allowable by law, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages and diminished earning capacity, damage to personal property, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other damages proven at trial, together with interest and costs. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B & 6C.
