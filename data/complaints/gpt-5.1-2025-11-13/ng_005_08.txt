COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PROPERTY DAMAGE ONLY)  

Plaintiff Jessica Parker (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Parker is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times resided at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times resided in the same duplex property as Plaintiff, located at or including 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

3. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Defendant shared use and access to a common driveway located at or adjacent to 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, or, alternatively, because Plaintiff, in good faith, seeks damages within the jurisdictional authority of the Superior Court.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because he is domiciled in Massachusetts and all acts and omissions alleged herein occurred within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3(a).

6. Venue is proper in Hampden County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the events and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and both parties reside in Hampden County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff resides at a duplex located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, where she shares a common driveway with Defendant.

8. At all times relevant, Defendant used and maintained various tools, equipment, and personal property along or adjacent to the shared driveway, including a tall aluminum extension ladder.

9. For a significant period of time prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant habitually stored and left a tall aluminum extension ladder in an upright, leaning position against a wooden fence located immediately adjacent to the area of the driveway where Plaintiff ordinarily parked and maneuvered her vehicle.

10. The ladder was not affixed, anchored, or otherwise secured to the fence, ground, or any other structure. It was free-standing in a leaning position subject to movement by wind or incidental contact.

11. The ladder’s height, weight, and material (aluminum) made it capable of falling over with force and causing substantial damage to nearby persons, vehicles, or property if it were to be dislodged or blown over.

12. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressly informed Defendant that she was concerned about the ladder’s unstable position next to her parking space and warned him that it could fall onto her vehicle, particularly on windy days.

13. Plaintiff specifically requested that Defendant either (a) securely tie down the ladder; (b) move it to a safer location; or (c) store it in a manner that would prevent it from falling into the shared driveway or onto Plaintiff’s vehicle.

14. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would tie down or move the ladder, but he failed to do so within a reasonable time or at all.

15. Despite these explicit warnings and his own assurances, Defendant continued to store and leave the ladder leaning unsecured against the wooden fence directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s parking area in the shared driveway.

16. On March 15, 2023, in Springfield, Massachusetts, weather conditions included gusty winds.

17. On or about March 15, 2023, at approximately a time during daylight hours, Plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and backing into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street to park in her usual space near the wooden fence.

18. As Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the driveway, a gust of wind struck the unsecured aluminum extension ladder that Defendant had left leaning against the wooden fence.

19. The gust of wind caused the ladder to topple and fall directly onto Plaintiff’s vehicle.

20. The ladder forcefully impacted the hood of Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing visible dents and deformation of the hood.

21. The ladder also struck Plaintiff’s windshield, causing cracks and damage that rendered the windshield unsafe and in need of replacement under applicable safety and inspection standards.

22. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating her vehicle in a normal, cautious manner and using the shared driveway in a customary and reasonable way consistent with her rights as a resident and co-user of the property.

23. The damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle occurred suddenly and without fault or contribution by Plaintiff.

24. As a direct and proximate result of the ladder falling on her vehicle, Plaintiff’s car was rendered unsafe to drive without repairs and required bodywork to repair the hood and replacement of the damaged windshield.

25. Plaintiff’s automobile insurance policy required her to pay an out-of-pocket deductible before the insurer would cover the balance of the repair costs.

26. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses for her insurance deductible for the necessary repair work to her vehicle, including, but not limited to, bodywork and replacement of the windshield.

27. Plaintiff further incurred out-of-pocket expenses for a rental vehicle while her car was in the repair shop for a period of more than one week.

28. Plaintiff suffered inconvenience, loss of use of her vehicle, disruption of her daily activities, and frustration associated with arranging repairs and alternative transportation.

29. Plaintiff did not sustain bodily or personal injuries requiring medical treatment and therefore incurred approximately $0 in medical expenses and lost approximately $0 in wages.

30. At all relevant times, Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that storing a tall, unsecured extension ladder upright and leaning against a fence next to a shared driveway created an unreasonable risk that it could fall and cause damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle or other property.

31. Defendant’s prior knowledge of Plaintiff’s specific complaints and warnings that the ladder might fall onto her car, together with his express promise to secure or move the ladder, further demonstrated his actual awareness of the risk and his failure to act with reasonable care.

32. Defendant failed to take basic and readily available steps—such as laying the ladder flat on the ground, storing it indoors, securing it with ties or brackets, or relocating it away from the driveway—that would have significantly reduced or eliminated the risk of harm.

33. The ladder’s fall and the resulting property damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the ladder, particularly during windy conditions.

34. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered property damage and economic loss, including, but not limited to, repair costs, insurance costs (deductible), rental vehicle expenses, and associated out-of-pocket expenses, plus consequential damages for loss of use and inconvenience.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
NEGLIGENCE (PROPERTY DAMAGE)

35. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully set forth herein.

36. Under Massachusetts law, every person owes a duty to exercise reasonable care toward others in the circumstances so as to avoid causing foreseeable harm. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–148 (2006) (recognizing duty where defendant’s conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm); *Remy v. MacDonald*, 440 Mass. 675, 677–678 (2004) (general duty of reasonable care).

37. Negligence under Massachusetts law consists of (a) a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (b) breach of that duty; (c) causation; and (d) actual damages. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146; *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

#### A. Duty

38. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s neighbor and co-occupant of a property with a shared driveway, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage, placement, and maintenance of objects on or adjacent to the shared driveway, including the aluminum extension ladder, so as to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff or her property.

39. Under Massachusetts common law governing property-related negligence, one who controls or stores items on premises in a manner that may foreseeably cause injury to others using the area must exercise reasonable care. See *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 52–53 (1983) (duty to take reasonable steps to protect foreseeable victims); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–156 (2013) (duty may arise where conduct creates a risk of harm on the premises).

40. The presence of a tall, unsecured ladder leaning against a fence in immediate proximity to a shared driveway created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk that the ladder could topple and damage vehicles or injure persons lawfully using the driveway.

41. Defendant’s duty of reasonable care is consistent with the general principles embodied in G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute), which presupposes the existence of a duty and standard of reasonable care in negligence actions.

#### B. Breach

42. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to secure the aluminum extension ladder against foreseeable movement or collapse due to wind or incidental contact;

   b. Leaving the ladder standing upright and leaning against a fence, adjacent to a shared driveway and parking area, when a safer method of storage (e.g., lying flat, securing, or relocating) was readily available;

   c. Ignoring or failing to act upon Plaintiff’s repeated, explicit warnings and complaints that the ladder could fall on her car, particularly in windy conditions;

   d. Failing to take timely corrective action despite promising Plaintiff that he would secure or move the ladder; and

   e. Failing to exercise the degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person in like circumstances would exercise with respect to storage and placement of a heavy object in a shared area.

43. Massachusetts courts recognize that where a defendant is specifically alerted to a hazardous condition and fails to remedy it, such inaction constitutes evidence of negligence. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378–379 (2010) (landowner liability where on notice of hazardous condition); *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837, 842 (1987) (foreseeability of harm where defendant knows of risk).

44. Defendant’s failure to take simple, inexpensive, and obvious precautions—after being expressly warned—falls below the standard of care required under Massachusetts negligence law. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640–641 (1996) (reasonable precautions in light of known risk).

#### C. Causation

45. “Cause in fact” (factual causation) exists where the harm would not have occurred “but for” the defendant’s negligent conduct, and “proximate cause” exists where the harm is a foreseeable result of the conduct. See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320–321 (2002); *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 641, 645–646 (2007).

46. But for Defendant’s negligent storage and placement of the ladder and his failure to secure or relocate it, the ladder would not have toppled onto Plaintiff’s vehicle on March 15, 2023, and Plaintiff’s vehicle would not have been damaged.

47. The fall of an unsecured, tall ladder during gusty wind conditions in close proximity to a parked or backing vehicle is a natural and foreseeable consequence of leaving the ladder in such a precarious position.

48. Defendant’s acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of the damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle and her resulting economic losses.

49. There were no superseding or intervening causes sufficient to break the chain of causation between Defendant’s negligence and Plaintiff’s harm.

#### D. Damages

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage and economic harm, including:

   a. Physical damage to the hood of her vehicle, requiring bodywork and repair;

   b. Damage to her windshield, requiring complete replacement;

   c. Out-of-pocket payment of her automobile insurance deductible in connection with the repairs;

   d. Rental car expenses incurred while her vehicle was being repaired for over one week;

   e. Loss of use of her vehicle and related inconvenience and disruption of her daily life; and

   f. Other incidental and consequential expenses related to arranging repairs and alternative transportation.

51. Although Plaintiff did not suffer bodily injury and incurred approximately $0 in medical bills and $0 in lost wages, Massachusetts law permits recovery for property damage, loss of use, and related economic losses resulting from negligence. See *Ayash v. Dana-Farber Cancer Inst.*, 443 Mass. 367, 402 (2005) (damages element in negligence); *Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co.*, 407 Mass. 185, 189–190 (1990) (recovery for consequential economic losses proximately caused by negligent act).

52. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any allegation of comparative negligence, if raised by Defendant, would at most reduce Plaintiff’s damages by any percentage of negligence attributable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff denies any negligence on her part and asserts that Defendant bears full responsibility, as she reasonably used the shared driveway and had repeatedly warned Defendant of the hazard.

53. Plaintiff claims damages, to be proven at trial, including but not limited to:

   a. The reasonable cost of repairing her vehicle’s hood and windshield;

   b. The amount of her insurance deductible paid out-of-pocket;

   c. The reasonable cost of a rental vehicle during the period of repair;

   d. Reasonable consequential damages for loss of use and inconvenience; and

   e. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, including G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in actions for damage to property).

54. Plaintiff also seeks taxable costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 261, §§ 1 et seq., and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.
