While the case clearly ties parental conduct and the child\u2019s need for safety to the best\u2011interests analysis, it does not specifically discuss placing inappropriate caretaking responsibilities on a child or elaborate on \"unsafe conditions\" beyond abuse and failure to protect from an abusive partner. Thus it only indirectly relates to, and does not clearly establish, the specific legal principle claimed.",

He found that J.B. had participated in the physical abuse and neglect of the children and was unable to protect her children from future abuse.\u201d"
