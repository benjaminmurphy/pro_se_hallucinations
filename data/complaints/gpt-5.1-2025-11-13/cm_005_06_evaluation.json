      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of custody and parenting provisions to promote the children\u2019s stability and best interests. Cooper v. Cooper addresses modification of child support and alimony based on changed financial circumstances and related child needs, not modification of custody or parenting time. While the opinion discusses material changes in circumstances for support, it does not provide authority for modifying custody/parenting provisions as described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn this appeal from a judgment of modification, Philip Cooper also challenges the increased alimony award, claiming that Peggy Cooper, his former wife, failed to establish a material change in circumstances justifying increases in alimony and child support\u2026 Here, the probate judge appropriately took into account Philip\u2019s significantly enhanced standard of living since the divorce and changes in the circumstances of the parties that had the effect of reducing the children\u2019s standard of living when residing with Peggy.\u201d"
