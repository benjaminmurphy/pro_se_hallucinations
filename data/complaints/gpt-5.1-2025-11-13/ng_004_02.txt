COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Emily Johnson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603, in the course of delivering groceries to a tenant of the property.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the owner, landlord, and/or person in control of the three‑unit residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Property”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court and involves a claim for personal injuries arising under Massachusetts law.

4. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the cause of action arose in Worcester County and the Property that is the subject of this action is located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Defendant, as owner and landlord of the three‑unit residential building at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, had possession, custody, and control over the exterior walkways and sidewalk abutting said premises, including the sidewalk used for ingress and egress to the building.

6. At all times relevant, Defendant owed all lawful visitors to the Property, including business invitees and lawful visitors such as Plaintiff, a duty of reasonable care to maintain the walkways and sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition, and to take reasonable steps to protect such persons against foreseeable hazards, including snow and ice accumulations.  
   See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).

7. On or about February 8–9, 2023, a winter snowstorm occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts, resulting in substantial snow accumulation on the sidewalk and walkways at the Property.

8. Following the snowstorm, Defendant undertook to clear the sidewalk at the Property but negligently failed to do so in a reasonably safe manner. Specifically, Defendant shoveled only a narrow, uneven path down the middle of the sidewalk without applying any salt, sand, or other ice‑melting or traction materials.

9. Over the next couple of days, due to normal daytime melting and nighttime refreezing, the narrow shoveled path on the sidewalk at the Property developed into a sheet of ice and became extremely slippery and hazardous.

10. Upon information and belief, tenants of the Property, prior to Plaintiff’s fall, observed the dangerous icy condition on the sidewalk and walkway and became concerned for their own safety and for the safety of visitors, mail carriers, delivery drivers, and other lawful users of the Property.

11. Upon information and belief, prior to February 10, 2023, tenants of the Property texted Defendant, informed her about the icy condition, sent her photographs of the hazardous ice on the sidewalk, and requested that she take care of the problem.

12. Upon information and belief, in response to those complaints, Defendant stated, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” and refused or failed to treat, sand, salt, or otherwise properly address the icy condition.

13. Defendant therefore had actual notice and knowledge of the specific icy hazard and deliberately chose not to take reasonable measures to remedy or warn of the dangerous condition.

14. On February 10, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Property to deliver groceries to a tenant of the building at 123 Maple Street. Plaintiff was a lawful visitor and business invitee reasonably using the primary sidewalk access to the building.

15. At approximately that date and time, Plaintiff walked up the sidewalk leading to the Property, in the normal and intended path of travel, unaware that the previously shoveled path had become a sheet of ice.

16. As Plaintiff proceeded along the sidewalk, her feet suddenly slipped out from under her on the ice‑covered path, and she violently fell backward, landing hard on her lower back on the icy, frozen surface.

17. The fall was sudden and unexpected; there were no warning signs, cones, barriers, sand, salt, or other precautions placed by Defendant to alert Plaintiff or other visitors of the icy hazard or to make the area reasonably safe.

18. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a sprained lower back and associated soft‑tissue injuries. Plaintiff experienced significant pain, stiffness, and difficulty with bending, lifting, sitting, and walking.

19. Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for her injuries, including, but not limited to, examination, imaging as recommended, medications, and follow‑up care. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date are approximately $1,200.00.

20. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week, resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.00.

21. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of normal activities as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

22. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the creation of the icy condition, had no control over the area of the fall, and acted as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.

23. The hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk was not open and obvious to Plaintiff under the circumstances, and, even if it were, Defendant was still required to take reasonable steps in light of the foreseeable risk of harm. See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

24. Defendant’s failure to reasonably maintain and treat the sidewalk, despite actual notice of the specific icy condition and the foreseeability of harm to lawful visitors such as Plaintiff, constituted negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(NEGLIGENCE)**

25. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 24 as if fully set forth herein.

26. Under Massachusetts common law, as clarified in *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973), landowners and persons in control of property owe lawful visitors, including invitees and lawful occupants and guests, a duty to act as a reasonable person in all the circumstances to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition.

27. In *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), the Supreme Judicial Court abolished the natural accumulation rule and held that a property owner owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to remedy or treat snow and ice conditions on the property, regardless of whether such accumulation is “natural” or “unnatural,” and may be liable for failing to do so with reasonable care.

28. Defendant, as owner and person in control of the Property, owed Plaintiff, a lawful visitor and business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of the walkways and sidewalk at 123 Maple Street, including the duty to:

   a. Properly remove snow and ice from the sidewalk and access ways in a reasonable manner;

   b. Apply salt, sand, or other reasonable ice‑treating or traction materials to prevent or lessen ice hazards;

   c. Inspect the premises within a reasonable time after snow and ice events;

   d. Remedy known or reasonably discoverable dangerous conditions, such as ice resulting from melting and refreezing; and

   e. Warn lawful visitors of known dangers that were not obvious and that posed an unreasonable risk of harm.

29. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to properly clear the sidewalk at the Property after the snowstorm and leaving only a narrow, hazardous path;

   b. Failing to apply any salt, sand, or other ice‑melting or traction materials to the shoveled path, despite foreseeable melting and refreezing;

   c. Failing to reasonably inspect the sidewalk and walkways in the days following the snowstorm, when the risk of ice formation from melting and refreezing was obvious and well known;

   d. Failing to respond reasonably to tenant complaints, photographs, and warnings about the icy condition and the danger it posed;

   e. Failing to treat, sand, or salt the sidewalk after receiving actual notice of the dangerous condition;

   f. Failing to place cones, barricades, warning signs, or other devices to warn lawful visitors such as Plaintiff of the icy condition; and

   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent property owner and landlord would under similar circumstances.

30. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the icy and dangerous condition of the sidewalk, particularly after receiving complaints and photographs from tenants, and thus had actual and/or constructive notice of the hazard. See *Deignan v. Lubarsky*, 318 Mass. 661 (1945); *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

31. Defendant’s failure to act despite actual notice of the dangerous icy condition was unreasonable and constituted negligence. The risk that a person lawfully using the sidewalk—such as a tenant, guest, mail carrier, or delivery driver—would slip and fall on the ice was foreseeable. See *Janosz v. J.C. Penney Co.*, 324 Mass. 394 (1949).

32. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s potential comparative negligence, if any, does not bar recovery so long as her negligence, if any, was not greater than the total negligence of the Defendant, and any recovery may only be reduced in proportion to Plaintiff’s percentage of fault. Plaintiff denies any negligence on her part, but pleads the statute in the alternative.

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk at the Property on February 10, 2023, and sustained bodily injury and other damages.

34. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages are the kind of harm that is reasonably foreseeable from failing to properly clear, sand, salt, or maintain a sidewalk subject to melting and refreezing, after a snowstorm, especially where the owner has been warned of the dangerous condition and chooses not to act. See *O’Sullivan v. Shaw*, 431 Mass. 201 (2000) (duty to act reasonably in light of foreseeable risks).

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:

   a. Medical expenses, including charges for evaluation, treatment, and related care, in the approximate amount of $1,200.00, and such additional medical expenses as may be incurred in the future, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 60F;

   b. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $800.00 in wages lost due to Plaintiff’s inability to work for approximately one week following the incident;

   c. Pain and suffering, both physical and emotional, including pain, discomfort, stress, and limitation of activities;

   d. Loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of Plaintiff’s ability to perform and enjoy her normal and usual daily activities;

   e. Out‑of‑pocket expenses and other incidental costs reasonably related to the injuries; and

   f. Such other damages as may be proven at trial.

36. Under G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on the damages awarded for her personal injuries from the date the action is commenced.

37. Under *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), and cases applying it (including, e.g., *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 416 Mass. 825 (1994), *Aylward v. McCloskey*, 412 Mass. 77 (1992), and *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988)), Massachusetts courts recognize that property owners and persons in control may be held liable in negligence for failing to use reasonable care to prevent or remedy dangerous snow and ice conditions on property they control, and Plaintiff’s claim is consistent with this body of law.
