THOMAS GREENE,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Greene (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts. Her current address is 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Springfield, MA 01105. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Thomas Greene is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and/or lessor of the residential rental premises located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01105 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action for money damages arising out of a residential tenancy for property located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

5. Venue is proper in the Springfield District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 239, § 2 because the rental premises that are the subject of this action are located at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01105 (the “Apartment” or “Unit”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment from on or about June 1, 2022 through the present.

8. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($1,300.00) to Defendant for the Apartment.

9. Defendant, as owner and landlord, is responsible for maintaining the Apartment and its electrical systems in compliance with the applicable state sanitary code, including without limitation 105 CMR 410.000, and for providing utilities and services required by law and by the lease.

10. At all relevant times, one of the two bedrooms in the Apartment was used by Plaintiff as a dedicated home office for her work.

11. Approximately six weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint, a serious electrical problem developed in that bedroom: the overhead light fixture stopped working and the electrical outlets in that bedroom ceased to provide power.

12. The rest of the Apartment’s electrical system has generally remained functional, but the bedroom in question has no working electricity, rendering it unusable as a bedroom or office.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical failure in the bedroom and requested that Defendant make repairs so that the room would again have working electricity.

14. In response, Defendant sent an electrician to inspect the problem. The electrician informed Plaintiff, and upon information and belief informed Defendant, that the problem could not be fixed with a simple repair and that a more extensive repair to the building’s old wiring was needed to restore power safely to that room.

15. Defendant has admitted to Plaintiff that the electrical repair is “complicated” because of the building’s old wiring and has stated that he is “getting quotes” for a more extensive repair.

16. Despite having actual knowledge of the condition for approximately six weeks, Defendant has failed and refused to undertake or complete the necessary repairs to restore electricity to the bedroom.

17. As a result, the bedroom has remained without electricity for roughly six weeks, and Plaintiff has been deprived of the use of one of the two bedrooms covered by her tenancy.

18. Without electricity, the affected bedroom is unsafe and unfit for its intended use as a sleeping room or as a home office, because it has no functioning lighting or power for necessary equipment.

19. Due to the ongoing electrical failure, Plaintiff has been unable to use the bedroom as a home office as she previously did, and she has been effectively denied the beneficial use of that room.

20. Plaintiff has been forced to move her office equipment, files, and work materials into the living room, substantially interfering with the normal use and enjoyment of the living room and of the Apartment as a whole.

21. The living room is now overcrowded and cluttered with office equipment and materials, making the Apartment feel cramped, disorganized, and significantly less habitable and enjoyable.

22. Plaintiff works from home, and the loss of a functional home office has interfered with her ability to work productively, professionally, and comfortably within the Apartment.

23. Because she cannot use the bedroom for work, Plaintiff has been compelled to work from coffee shops and other public places, incurring daily expenses for coffee and food of approximately Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per day in order to have a place to sit and work with power and internet access.

24. In addition, Plaintiff has obtained a coworking‑space membership at a cost of approximately One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per month in order to maintain a functional workspace outside the Apartment.

25. These out‑of‑pocket expenses are directly attributable to the lack of electricity in the bedroom and Plaintiff’s resulting inability to use a significant portion of the leased premises for its intended residential and work‑from‑home purposes.

26. The continued lack of electricity in the bedroom also affects Plaintiff’s health, comfort, safety, and quiet enjoyment of the Apartment, as she must navigate a cramped, cluttered living area and lacks a private, properly lit, and powered room for rest, work, or storage.

27. The condition constitutes a material deprivation of services and a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

28. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been current in her rent and has complied with her material obligations as a tenant.

29. Defendant’s failure to repair and restore electricity to the bedroom has persisted for an unreasonable period of time, despite notice and opportunity to cure, and is continuing as of the date of this Complaint.

30. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered damages of at least One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800.00), including but not limited to rent abatement for the loss of use of a bedroom and consequential expenses such as coffee‑shop costs and coworking‑space fees.

31. In addition to direct out‑of‑pocket costs, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment, stress, inconvenience, and disruption of her daily life as a result of Defendant’s failure to remedy the condition.

32. The electrical defects in the bedroom and the resulting denial of use of that room constitute a defective condition and an interference with services required under the applicable housing laws and codes, including without limitation the minimum standards of fitness for human habitation under 105 CMR 410.000 and the implied warranty of habitability recognized in Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

33. The substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use her bedroom and home office, and to quietly and beneficially enjoy the Apartment, was caused by Defendant’s acts and omissions in failing to timely and adequately repair the electrical system and restore essential services.

34. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

35. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully restated herein.

36. Massachusetts law implies into every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment, and G.L. c. 186, § 14 expressly prohibits a landlord from “directly or indirectly interfer[ing] with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

37. A landlord’s failure to maintain a dwelling in conformity with the state sanitary code and to provide essential services can constitute an unlawful interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994).

38. Under Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), a landlord may be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment when the landlord’s actions or inactions “had a natural and probable consequence of interfering with the tenants’ use and enjoyment of the premises,” even absent a specific intent to cause such interference.

39. Defendant’s failure for approximately six weeks to correct the electrical failure in one bedroom of the Apartment, after being placed on notice and after being advised by an electrician that a more substantial repair was required, constitutes an unreasonable failure to provide essential services and to maintain the premises in compliance with housing standards.

40. Massachusetts courts have held that substantial and ongoing defects affecting habitability, utilities, or essential services, when not remedied with reasonable promptness after notice, constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  

   a. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where activities on adjoining premises interfered with tenants’ quiet enjoyment);  
   b. Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994) (landlord’s failure to remedy sanitary‑code violations after notice could support multiple damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14);  
   c. Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (repeated water leaks and landlord’s negligent failure to repair supported finding of breach of quiet enjoyment);  
   d. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s failure to remedy sewage‑backup problem breached tenant’s quiet enjoyment);  
   e. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord’s conduct in connection with services and conditions may give rise to liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14);  
   f. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (violations of state sanitary code justify rent abatement and damages);  
   g. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (recognizing breadth of quiet enjoyment protections for tenants);  
   h. Mitchell v. U‑Haul Co. of Mass., 396 Mass. 282 (1985) (discussing measure of damages for loss of use and enjoyment);  
   i. Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (adopting implied warranty of habitability; substantial defects can support rent abatement and relief);  
   j. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (per curiam) (sanitary‑code violations and interference with quiet enjoyment warrant damages).

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment” of any residential premises is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

42. Defendant’s failure to timely repair and restore electrical service to the bedroom has directly and foreseeably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and beneficial use of the Apartment by:

   a. Depriving Plaintiff of the use of one of two bedrooms;  
   b. Depriving Plaintiff of a functional home office that she relied on for her work;  
   c. Forcing Plaintiff to overcrowd and clutter the living room with office equipment and materials; and  
   d. Requiring Plaintiff to incur daily expenses at coffee shops and to pay for a coworking‑space membership to have a suitable place to work.

43. Defendant’s prolonged inaction in the face of a known, serious electrical defect affecting an entire bedroom is a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and exceeds the level of minor inconvenience or temporary disruption tolerated under Massachusetts law.

44. Plaintiff’s loss of use of a material portion of the leased premises and her out‑of‑pocket expenditures for alternative workspaces are a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of his statutory and common‑law duties.

45. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff actual damages, including but not limited to: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of a significant part of the Apartment; (b) rent abatement attributable to the unusable bedroom; (c) coffee‑shop and food expenses of approximately Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per day while she works outside the Apartment; (d) coworking‑space membership fees of approximately One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per month; and (e) inconvenience, disruption, and distress.

46. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent (3 × $1,300.00 = $3,900.00), whichever is greater, as well as costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14. Although Plaintiff is self‑represented at this time, she reserves the right to seek attorney’s fees if she later retains counsel.

47. Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 is independent of, and in addition to, any claim Plaintiff might have under the implied warranty of habitability, G.L. c. 239, or G.L. c. 93A; however, in this action Plaintiff asserts only the statutory cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### V. DAMAGES

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, presently estimated at not less than One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800.00), consisting of:

   a. Rent abatement reflecting the loss of use of one of the two bedrooms for approximately six weeks;  
   b. Coffee‑shop and related costs of approximately Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per day during the period she was forced to work outside the Apartment;  
   c. Coworking‑space membership fees of approximately One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per month; and  
   d. Non‑economic losses related to inconvenience, disruption, and loss of enjoyment of the Apartment.

49. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover at least three months’ rent or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Three months’ rent at $1,300.00 per month equals Three Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($3,900.00).

50. Plaintiff therefore seeks an award of statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than Three Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($3,900.00), or such other amount as the Court deems just, together with costs, interest, and such further relief as is appropriate.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Greene, and award the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than Three Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($3,900.00) (three months’ rent), or alternatively Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to rent abatement, coffee‑shop expenses, coworking‑space fees, and other provable losses, whichever is greater;

C. An award of costs of this action, including the filing fee and service of process costs;

D. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, should Plaintiff later retain counsel;
