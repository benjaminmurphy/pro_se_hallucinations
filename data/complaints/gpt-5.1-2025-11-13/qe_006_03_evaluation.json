Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200\u201304 (1979); Hemingway v. Commonwealth, 363 Mass. 184, 199\u2013201 (1973); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308\u201309 (1977).",

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion is about damages for breach of the implied warranty of habitability based on State Sanitary Code violations; it never discusses G.L. c. 186, \u00a714 or \"substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.\" The court frames the violations as breaches of the implied warranty of habitability and focuses on how to measure the resulting rent abatement, not on whether such violations constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. Thus, while it supports the idea that sanitary code violations affect habitability and rental value, it does not provide authority for the specific quiet-enjoyment proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThis case returns to us\u2026for computation by the trial judge of the damages owed to a tenant by his landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability\u2026 the judge had awarded damages\u2026for violations of the State Sanitary Code\u2026 We also agree with the judge that McKenna is not entitled to receive damages for the minor code violations in this case. As we emphasized in our earlier opinion, not every defect gives rise to a diminution in rental value, and it has been held that isolated violations may be found not to constitute a breach of the warranty of habitability.\u201d"
