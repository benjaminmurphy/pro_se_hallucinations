------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PERSONAL INJURY – PREMISES LIABILITY)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant FreshMart Grocery Store (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant FreshMart Grocery Store is a business entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States, operating a retail grocery store open to the public and doing business at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, maintained, and controlled the premises located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), and held it open to the public as a grocery store.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injuries arising out of Defendant’s negligence in the operation, maintenance, and control of its Premises in Somerville, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, such that the Superior Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 8, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County and the Defendant conducts business in Middlesex County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 9, 2023, at approximately a Saturday afternoon hour, Plaintiff Emily Johnson lawfully entered Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, as a customer and business invitee.

8. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was on the Premises for the mutual economic benefit of herself and Defendant, purchasing groceries and other items, and was owed the duty of reasonable care owed to a business invitee under Massachusetts law.  
   See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (abolishing common-law distinctions among invitees and licensees and recognizing duty of reasonable care owed to all lawful visitors).

9. While Plaintiff was shopping in the dairy aisle of the store, she encountered a substantial puddle of spilled milk on the floor.

10. The puddle of milk was readily visible and extended across a noticeable portion of the aisle, containing visible shopping cart tracks running through it, indicating that the spill had existed for a period of time sufficient for customers to traverse it before Plaintiff’s fall.

11. There were no cones, warning signs, “wet floor” placements, barricades, or other visual or verbal warnings to alert customers, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition created by the spilled milk.

12. At or about the time of the incident, a FreshMart employee was stocking shelves in the same dairy aisle, approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the location of the puddle.

13. As Plaintiff walked in a normal and careful manner along the dairy aisle, she stepped into the puddle of spilled milk, her foot slipped, and she fell forcefully to the floor, landing primarily on her hip.

14. Immediately after Plaintiff’s fall, the nearby FreshMart employee came over to Plaintiff and stated, in substance, that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but had been finishing what he was doing before going to get a mop.

15. The employee’s admission that he had noticed the spill prior to Plaintiff’s fall, yet chose to continue stocking shelves instead of immediately cleaning the spill or warning customers, demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition and failed to take timely and reasonable steps to remedy or warn of it.

16. Defendant’s employee’s statement constitutes an admission of knowledge and is binding upon Defendant under principles of agency. See, e.g., Ruszcyk v. Secretary of Pub. Safety, 401 Mass. 418, 420–21 (1988) (discussing evidentiary effect of admissions by agents within scope of employment).

17. After the fall, Plaintiff, believing at first that she was only mildly shaken, completed her shopping and left the store.

18. Later that day and into the night of September 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s hip pain significantly worsened, causing difficulty walking, standing, and sleeping.

19. On or about September 10, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical evaluation at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain caused by the fall.

20. Plaintiff subsequently underwent a course of physical therapy to treat her hip injury and related symptoms.

21. As a direct and proximate result of the fall and hip injury, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses, including urgent care visits, diagnostic care, and physical therapy.

22. Plaintiff worked at a café and, as a direct consequence of her hip injury and resulting limitations, missed multiple scheduled work shifts, resulting in lost wages of approximately $1,500.

23. Plaintiff also suffered and continues to suffer pain and discomfort in her hip, loss of enjoyment of life, and limitations on her ability to perform ordinary daily activities, stand for extended periods, and engage in recreational and household tasks.

24. Defendant, acting through its employees and agents, had a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including the dairy aisle, in a reasonably safe condition for customers such as Plaintiff, to inspect the area at reasonable intervals, to promptly clean up known spills, and to warn customers of any unreasonably dangerous conditions which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known existed.

25. Defendant’s failure to promptly clean the spilled milk, cordon off the area, or provide any warning signs or cones after its employee had actual knowledge of the spill breached Defendant’s duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law.  
   See, e.g., Deaton v. Burroughs, 367 Mass. 382, 385–86 (1975) (duty to maintain premises in reasonably safe condition and remedy dangers of which landowner knows or should know); Lindsey v. Massios, 372 Mass. 79, 82–83 (1977).

26. Defendant either created the dangerous condition, had actual notice of it (as admitted by its employee), or had constructive notice because the spill existed for a sufficient period that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it.  
   See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–84 (2007) (store owner liable where it created or had actual or constructive notice of hazardous condition on floor); Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (constructive notice where condition existed long enough that reasonable inspection would have discovered it).

27. The presence of visible cart tracks through the milk, combined with the employee’s acknowledgment that he had seen the spill “a few minutes ago,” shows that the hazardous condition existed long enough for Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, to either clean the spill or protect customers from it.

28. Defendant failed to implement and/or enforce reasonable inspection and cleanup procedures in a high-risk area such as the dairy aisle, where spills of liquid products are reasonably foreseeable and recurrent.  
   See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 788–89 (discussing recurring hazard doctrine and store’s duty to employ reasonable measures addressing foreseeable spills).

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of its duty of reasonable care, Plaintiff slipped and fell, sustained a hip sprain, suffered pain and suffering, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and endured other consequential damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence – Premises Liability)**

30. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–29 above as if fully set forth herein.

31. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier who invites members of the public onto its premises owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect lawful visitors from foreseeable risks of harm.  
    See Mounsey, 363 Mass. at 707; Doherty v. Belmont, 396 Mass. 271, 275 (1985).

32. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful customer and business invitee, a duty of reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, maintenance, and control of its grocery store located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

33. Defendant had a duty to take reasonable steps to:  
    a. Inspect the aisles, including the dairy aisle, at reasonable and appropriate intervals;  
    b. Detect and promptly remedy any spillage of liquids or other substances on the floor;  
    c. Warn customers adequately of any dangerous conditions of which Defendant knew or should have known; and  
    d. Implement and enforce reasonable policies and procedures to address recurring and foreseeable hazards such as liquid spills in grocery aisles.

34. Defendant, acting through its employees, breached its duty of care by, among other things:  
    a. Failing to timely clean up the puddle of spilled milk after actual notice of the spill;  
    b. Failing to place cones, “wet floor” signs, or other warnings around the spill;  
    c. Allowing customers to continue to traverse the area despite knowledge of the spill;  
    d. Failing to train and/or supervise employees adequately regarding inspection, cleanup, and warning protocols for spills; and  
    e. Failing to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for customers.

35. Defendant’s negligence is established under ordinary principles of premises liability and under the “mode of operation”/recurring hazard approach recognized in Massachusetts for self-service stores where recurring conditions create a foreseeable risk.  
    See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 788–89 (noting that in self-service supermarket settings with recurring spills, the focus is on reasonableness of store’s cleaning and inspection procedures rather than on proof of specific notice of each spill); Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc., 471 Mass. 679, 685–87 (2015).

36. Defendant’s employee’s admission that he had observed the spill “a few minutes” before Plaintiff’s fall is evidence of Defendant’s actual notice and failure to take timely remedial measures or provide warnings, which constitutes a breach of the standard of care.  
    See Thurlow v. Crossman, 336 Mass. 248, 251–52 (1957) (liability where defendant knew of dangerous condition and failed to warn or remedy); Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc., 355 Mass. 450, 452–53 (1969).

37. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. But for Defendant’s failure to timely clean the spill, guard the area, or warn of the hazard, Plaintiff would not have slipped and fallen.

38. Plaintiff was at all relevant times exercising due care for her own safety, walking normally in a grocery aisle where no hazards were marked or warned against. Plaintiff had no reasonable way to anticipate or avoid the unmarked puddle of spilled milk.  
    See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute, providing that plaintiff’s recovery is diminished only in proportion to her negligence, if any, and barred only if her negligence exceeds that of defendant).

39. As a foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries including, but not limited to, a hip sprain, pain and suffering, discomfort, emotional distress, and limitations on activities of daily living.

40. As a further foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur medical expenses for treatment of her injuries, including, but not limited to, urgent care visits, diagnostic testing, and physical therapy.  
    See G.L. c. 231, § 6D (governing recovery of damages for pain and suffering in motor vehicle torts; by analogy, Massachusetts permits recovery of medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering in negligence cases generally).

41. Plaintiff also sustained lost wages and loss of earning capacity due to missed shifts at her café job, in the approximate amount of $1,500.

42. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and impairment or loss of enjoyment of life.  
    See, e.g., Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 873–74 (1991) (discussing elements of compensatory damages in personal injury actions); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 787–88 (1975).

43. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement and/or amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence, including but not limited to itemization of damages and additional detail as to her medical treatment, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15.

### V. DAMAGES

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:

   a. **Medical Expenses:** Approximately $1,200 in past medical expenses related to evaluation and treatment of her hip injury, including urgent care and physical therapy, with the likelihood of additional, reasonably anticipated future medical expenses;

   b. **Lost Wages:** Approximately $1,500 in lost wages from missed café shifts while recovering from her injury;

   c. **Pain and Suffering:** Physical pain, soreness, and discomfort in her hip and related areas, including ongoing pain upon standing, walking, and performing daily tasks;

   d. **Loss of Enjoyment of Life and Activities:** Limitations in recreational activities, household chores, and general enjoyment of life;

   e. **Emotional Distress and Inconvenience:** Anxiety, stress, and inconvenience associated with the fall, medical treatment, and financial strain caused by the injury.

45. Plaintiff seeks compensation for all such damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, together with statutory interest from the date of commencement of this action, and costs.  
    See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions).
