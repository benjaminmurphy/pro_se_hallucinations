DISCOUNT HOME GOODS, INC.,  
Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE**

Plaintiff Ryan Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Ryan Thompson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on the premises of Defendant’s retail store located in Lowell, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of one or more of the states of the United States, authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and operating retail stores, including the store located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the retail premises located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, MA (the “Premises”), and employed the managers and employees working therein.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because Plaintiff seeks damages in an amount greater than the jurisdictional minimum for the Superior Court.

5. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and 8, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County and the Defendant operates and does business in Middlesex County at 214 Market Street, Lowell, MA.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant regularly conducts business within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and maintains and operates the Premises in Lowell, Massachusetts, where the incident giving rise to this action occurred. See, e.g., G.L. c. 223A, §§ 3(a), (c).

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a customer lawfully on the Premises at 214 Market Street, Lowell, MA, for the purpose of purchasing household goods.

8. Plaintiff was a business invitee to whom Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect Plaintiff against unreasonable risks of harm that Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).

9. While in the kitchen-wares section of the store, Plaintiff was looking at kitchen items on shelves in an aisle open to the general public.

10. In that aisle, Defendant, through its employees and/or agents, had stacked heavy boxes of appliances, including toaster ovens and similar items, in vertical piles approximately five to six boxes high on open shelving.

11. These heavy boxes were stacked without adequate safety measures, such as restraints, straps, barriers, guards, warning signs, or other protective devices to prevent them from falling into the customer aisle.

12. The boxes were stored in a manner that created an unreasonable risk that they could fall into the aisle in response to ordinary customer activity, including the normal movement and bumping of shopping carts.

13. While Plaintiff was in this aisle, another customer was pushing a shopping cart down the aisle in an ordinary manner.

14. The other customer’s cart made a normal, incidental contact with a lower shelf—of the type that is reasonably foreseeable in a busy retail store—as the customer proceeded down the aisle.

15. As a direct result of that minor shelf contact, a large, heavy toaster‑oven box stored on or near the top of the stacked boxes came loose and fell from a height above Plaintiff.

16. The falling toaster-oven box struck Plaintiff forcefully on the shoulder and side of the head.

17. Immediately after impact, Plaintiff experienced dizziness and a severe headache and was in significant pain and discomfort.

18. Store personnel, including the manager on duty, came to the scene after the incident and completed an incident report documenting that a boxed appliance had fallen from an upper shelf and struck Plaintiff.

19. The store manager provided Plaintiff with a store coupon but did not meaningfully address the unsafe stacking method or remove or secure similar stacks of heavy appliances in the aisle.

20. Later that day, Plaintiff’s symptoms—including dizziness, headache, and shoulder pain—worsened.

21. That evening, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at a hospital emergency department.

22. Medical providers at the emergency department diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain, prescribed appropriate treatment, and instructed Plaintiff to limit physical activity and rest.

23. As a direct and foreseeable result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses, including emergency room evaluation and follow-up care.

24. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed as a delivery driver.

25. Due to his concussion symptoms, shoulder strain, and the restrictions imposed by his medical providers, Plaintiff was unable to work for several days following the incident.

26. Plaintiff consequently lost approximately $800 in wages.

27. Plaintiff also was unable to participate in his regular weekly soccer league for approximately one month, causing him loss of enjoyment of life and disruption of his normal activities.

28. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non‑economic damages as a result of the incident.

29. The dangerous condition—that is, the stacking of heavy appliance boxes five to six boxes high on open shelving without restraints or other safeguards in a high-traffic customer aisle—was created by Defendant, its employees, and/or its agents.

30. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that heavy boxed appliances stacked in this manner posed a foreseeable risk of falling when shelves were subject to ordinary customer contact or vibration.

31. Defendant further knew or should have known that ordinary customers using shopping carts would, from time to time, contact shelves or displays, and that such incidental contact could dislodge improperly stacked or unsecured merchandise.

32. Defendant failed to implement or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the safe stacking, racking, and securing of heavy merchandise in customer areas.

33. Defendant failed to train its employees adequately in safe merchandising practices and failed to require that heavy items be stored in a manner that would prevent them from falling onto customers.

34. Defendant failed to inspect the shelving and stacked heavy items in a reasonably timely and adequate fashion to identify and correct the hazardous stacking condition.

35. Defendant failed to warn Plaintiff and other customers of the unreasonable risk posed by the heavy, improperly stacked boxes, despite having superior knowledge of the risks associated with its chosen method of stacking merchandise.

36. Reasonable safety measures, such as lower stacking heights, shelf guards, retaining straps, safety rails, or relocation of heavy items to safer storage locations, were available and feasible, but Defendant failed to employ them.

37. Had Defendant acted with reasonable care in storing, stacking, inspecting, and securing the boxed appliances in the aisle, the toaster‑oven box would not have fallen and Plaintiff would not have been injured.

38. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff sustained the injuries, expenses, and losses described herein.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

39. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 38 as if fully set forth herein.

40. Under Massachusetts law, the owner or person in control of property owes a duty to lawful visitors to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect against foreseeable risks of harm. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

41. Defendant, as owner, operator, and/or party in control of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the store, including shelving and merchandise displays, in a condition that was reasonably safe for customers.

42. That duty included, but was not limited to:

   a. Stacking and storing heavy merchandise in a reasonably safe manner so as not to create an unreasonable risk of falling objects;

   b. Inspecting shelving and merchandise regularly to identify and correct hazardous conditions, including unsafe stacking;

   c. Implementing reasonable policies and training employees to handle, stack, and display heavy items safely;

   d. Taking reasonable steps to prevent heavy items from falling into customer aisles, including the use of restraints, guards, or alternative storage methods; and

   e. Warning customers of dangerous or unreasonably hazardous conditions that Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known existed.

43. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to, by:

   a. Stacking heavy appliance boxes five to six units high on open shelves without restraints or barriers in customer aisles;

   b. Failing to secure heavy items placed at or near head height or above in areas where customers walk and push shopping carts;

   c. Failing to adopt or enforce adequate safety policies governing the stacking and storage of heavy merchandise;

   d. Failing to train and supervise employees regarding the safe merchandising of weighted and bulky items;

   e. Failing to inspect and correct obviously dangerous stacking configurations that created a foreseeable risk of falling merchandise;

   f. Failing to warn Plaintiff of the hazardous condition created by the dangerously stacked boxes; and

   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent retail store operator would under like circumstances.

44. The falling of a heavy boxed appliance from a high shelf in response to minor shelf contact is the type of accident that does not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence in how merchandise is stacked and secured. See, e.g., *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (foreseeable risks and duty of reasonable care); *Uloth v. City Tank Corp.*, 376 Mass. 874 (1978) (duty to guard against foreseeable hazards).

45. The risk that customers or their carts would make incidental contact with shelving is reasonably foreseeable in a retail environment, and a reasonably prudent store would protect against the risk that such contact could dislodge improperly stacked heavy items. See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) (foreseeability and duty to protect against risks where the defendant’s conduct creates the hazard).

46. Under *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), a property owner’s duty of reasonable care extends to all reasonably foreseeable dangers arising from conditions on the property, regardless of whether the hazard is created by the owner, by others, or by natural conditions. Here, the hazardous condition was affirmatively created and maintained by Defendant.

47. Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition by virtue of having created the stacking configuration, its ongoing control of the merchandising and shelving, and the open and obvious nature of the tall, unsecured stacks of heavy boxes. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 431 Mass. 22 (2000) (notice may be inferred where the defendant created the dangerous condition or should have discovered it through reasonable inspection).

48. The duty of reasonable care includes the duty to anticipate the negligence of third persons when such negligence is reasonably foreseeable and to take reasonable precautions against the resulting harm. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996); *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196 (1994). Defendant was required to anticipate that customers might inadvertently contact shelving with carts and to store merchandise in a way that remained safe under such conditions.

49. Defendant’s breach of its duty of reasonable care directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries. But for Defendant’s negligent stacking, securing, inspection, and maintenance practices, the toaster‑oven box would not have fallen and struck Plaintiff.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following injuries and losses:

   a. A mild concussion, resulting in headaches, dizziness, and other associated symptoms;

   b. A shoulder strain, causing pain, limitation of movement, and physical discomfort;

   c. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,500, including emergency room treatment and related care;

   d. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $800 due to his inability to work as a delivery driver for several days;

   e. Loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month;

   f. Pain and suffering, both physical and emotional, arising out of and caused by the concussion and shoulder injury and their sequelae; and

   g. Such other and further damages as will be proven at trial.

51. Plaintiff’s damages were the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligence and fall within the scope of the risk created by Defendant’s conduct. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312 (2002).

52. No comparative negligence on the part of Plaintiff caused or contributed to his injuries. Plaintiff was lawfully present, was using the Premises as intended, and did nothing more than stand in the aisle and examine merchandise when the box fell.

53. To the extent Defendant contends that the negligence of the other customer in bumping the shelf contributed to the incident, such conduct was reasonably foreseeable and does not relieve Defendant of its duty or liability under Massachusetts law. See *Griffiths v. Campbell*, 425 Mass. 31 (1997) (defendant may be liable for harm resulting from reasonably foreseeable intervening acts of third parties).

54. Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages caused by its negligence under Massachusetts common law of negligence, as informed by the principles set forth in cases including but not limited to:

   - *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973);  
   - *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995);  
   - *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980);  
   - *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010);  
   - *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983);  
   - *Uloth v. City Tank Corp.*, 376 Mass. 874 (1978);  
   - *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006);  
   - *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 431 Mass. 22 (2000);  
   - *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996);  
   - *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013);  
   - *Griffiths v. Campbell*, 425 Mass. 31 (1997); and  
   - *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196 (1994).

(collectively demonstrating the duty of reasonable care in premises liability cases, foreseeability, notice, and liability for harm arising from dangerous conditions on property.)
