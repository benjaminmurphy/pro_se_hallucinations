COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Jason Miller (“Defendant” or “Father”), and says as follows:

1. This is a Complaint for Modification of an existing custody and parenting time judgment of the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court concerning the minor child, Emily Miller, born [REDACTED] 2017, age 8 (“Emily” or “the minor child”).

2. Plaintiff is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the primary physical custodian of the minor child pursuant to an existing judgment of this Court entered on May 15, 2021.

3. Defendant is an individual who currently resides, or proposes to reside, outside the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in the State of New Hampshire, and is the minor child’s father. He presently exercises parenting time pursuant to the May 15, 2021 order of this Court.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6 and G.L. c. 209C (if applicable), and consistent with the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G.L. c. 209B, because Massachusetts is and has been the home state of the minor child and the original judgment was issued by this Court.

5. On May 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary Order incorporated into a final judgment) governing legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the parties’ minor child (the “2021 Judgment”).

6. Pursuant to the 2021 Judgment, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Emily, and Defendant has parenting time every Wednesday and every other weekend, based on the parties’ mutual residence in or near Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, at the time the judgment entered.

7. The 2021 Judgment and parenting-time schedule were expressly and implicitly premised on the parties residing in reasonably close geographic proximity to one another and to the minor child’s school and activities, such that the child could attend a local school in the Cambridge area without undue travel time or disruption.

8. Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred. Defendant now seeks to relocate his residence to New Hampshire for employment and to continue exercising the same midweek and alternate weekend parenting plan set forth in the 2021 Judgment.

9. Defendant’s proposed relocation to New Hampshire, combined with his insistence on maintaining the existing midweek overnight and alternate weekend schedule, would require the minor child to endure lengthy, repeated car trips of approximately ninety (90) minutes each way under typical traffic conditions between Cambridge and Defendant’s new residence.

10. Under the current schedule, as applied to Defendant’s New Hampshire relocation, Emily would be required to travel roughly three (3) hours round-trip for a midweek overnight, including late-evening and early-morning travel on school nights, in order to attend school back in the Cambridge area the next morning.

11. This extended midweek travel time would deprive Emily of adequate sleep, interfere with completion of homework, and significantly disrupt her weekday routine, including after‑school activities and social interactions with peers.

12. Emily has already begun to express anxiety and stress related to the prospect of these long drives, her fear of being tired and unprepared for school, and her concern about missing established after‑school activities and time with friends.

13. The anticipated relocation and its impact on the existing schedule were not contemplated by the Court or the parties at the time of the 2021 Judgment. At that time both parties resided in the Cambridge area and the parenting schedule was crafted for a short‑distance, local arrangement.

14. The combination of Defendant’s relocation to another state, the practical effect on the minor child’s school schedule and extracurricular activities, and the child’s increasing age and associated school and social demands is a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the prior order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010), and Subsequent to Custody of Sorentino, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 112 (2012).

15. Under Massachusetts law, a probate and family court may modify a prior custody and parenting judgment when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Hinds v. Hinds, 329 Mass. 190 (1952); and Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

16. The best interests of the child standard governs all custody and parenting time determinations in Massachusetts. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–844 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

17. In assessing best interests, Massachusetts courts consider, among other factors, the child’s age and developmental needs, the stability and continuity of the child’s environment, the child’s educational and social needs, and each parent’s ability to meet those needs. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 192–193 (1998); Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 595, 602–603 (1981).

18. Frequent, lengthy, and burdensome travel time associated with a parenting plan, especially on school nights, is a factor courts may consider in determining whether an existing plan remains in the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 546–548 (2010) (recognizing that relocation and related travel burdens may constitute a material change in circumstances requiring reconsideration of parenting arrangements).

19. The proposed regular ninety‑minute (90‑minute) one‑way commute on school nights for an eight‑year‑old child would undermine her rest, academic performance, and participation in after‑school activities and would create unnecessary stress and anxiety, contrary to her best interests.

20. Massachusetts appellate decisions make clear that a prior custody or parenting judgment, even if originally appropriate, must be revisited when circumstances change so that continued enforcement would no longer serve the child’s welfare. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845–846; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–739 (1996).

21. In addition, although this Complaint for Modification does not seek or oppose removal of the child from Massachusetts within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 30, the relocation context is analogous in that the Court must weigh the practical effect of geography and travel on the child’s life. See Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710–712 (1985); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183–184 (2006).

22. As in relocation cases, the Court here should consider “the advantages of the move, the soundness of the reasons advanced for the move, the integrity of the motives of both parents, and the interests of the child,” Yannas, 395 Mass. at 711–712, as well as the practical feasibility of maintaining frequent and meaningful contact with both parents without imposing unreasonable burdens on the child.

23. While Plaintiff recognizes Defendant’s right to pursue employment opportunities, that right does not entitle him to maintain an unchanged parenting schedule that was crafted for local proximity when doing so would substantially burden the child and conflict with her educational and emotional well‑being. See Mason, 447 Mass. at 184–186; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 547–548.

24. It is in Emily’s best interests that her school‑week schedule remain as stable, predictable, and free from excessive travel as reasonably possible, and that she be allowed to participate consistently in age‑appropriate activities and maintain appropriate sleep and study routines.

25. Emily’s anxiety and expressed concern about the long drives and lost after‑school activities is consistent with the practical difficulties that a three‑hour round‑trip commute on school nights would entail for a child of her age.

26. Continuing the existing midweek overnight parenting time in light of Defendant’s relocation would therefore no longer be in Emily’s best interests and would represent an unanticipated and undue burden on her schooling, extracurricular engagements, and emotional health.

27. Modification of the parenting schedule to eliminate the midweek overnight and to adjust alternate weekend parenting time to accommodate the increased distance between households is a reasonable and narrowly tailored response to the changed circumstances and is consistent with Emily’s best interests.

28. The requested modification preserves and supports Defendant’s continued relationship with Emily while prioritizing her health, education, and stability, in accordance with the principles articulated in Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–846, and Rosenberg, 428 Mass. at 193.

29. Plaintiff is not seeking to eliminate Defendant’s role as a parent or his parenting time but to modify the manner and timing of that parenting time so that it is developmentally appropriate and logistically feasible given the new geographic reality.

30. The requested relief is also consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31, which requires the Court to “consider the best interests of the child” in determining custody and parenting time and to “presume that frequent and continuing contact with the parents is in the best interests of the child” where appropriate, while recognizing that the form of such contact must not be detrimental to the child.

31. Massachusetts courts have held that where a schedule interferes with a child’s education, stability, or well‑being, the schedule must yield to the child’s best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596; Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–739; and Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 332–333 (2010).

32. A modified schedule that reduces midweek commuting and consolidates time into less disruptive blocks (such as weekends and school vacations, where appropriate) is consistent with these principles and with the child‑focused approach required by Massachusetts law.

33. Plaintiff has acted, and continues to act, in good faith, focusing on Emily’s needs and attempting to work with Defendant to develop a schedule that reflects Defendant’s relocation while minimizing the impact on Emily.

34. To date, however, Defendant has insisted on maintaining the pre‑relocation parenting schedule without sufficient adjustment for the longer travel times and related burdens on Emily, making judicial intervention necessary.

35. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and applicable case law, including Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010), Hinds v. Hinds, 329 Mass. 190 (1952), Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998), Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996), Subsequent to Custody of Sorentino, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 112 (2012), and Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010), a finding of material change in circumstances and entry of a modified parenting plan are warranted.

36. Plaintiff seeks a modification order that:

   a. Confirms that Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Miller;

   b. Eliminates Defendant’s midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time, with provision for reasonable midweek dinner or virtual contact where logistically feasible and not unduly burdensome to the child;

   c. Adjusts Defendant’s alternate weekend parenting time to account for the increased travel distance, such as by:

  i. Maintaining alternate weekends but clarifying pick‑up and drop‑off times and locations to minimize disruption to Emily’s school and activities; and/or  

  ii. Providing for additional time during school vacations, long weekends, and/or summer breaks to ensure that Emily continues to enjoy substantial and meaningful time with Defendant without excessive school‑night travel; and  

   d. Includes any other terms the Court deems just and proper to protect the minor child’s best interests.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that substantial and material changes in circumstances have occurred since the May 15, 2021 Judgment, including Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting burden and disruption on the minor child’s school‑week schedule and well‑being;

2. Find that continuation of the existing midweek overnight parenting schedule in light of these changed circumstances is no longer in the best interests of the minor child;

3. Modify the existing custody and parenting time provisions of the May 15, 2021 Judgment so that:

   a. Plaintiff continues as the primary physical custodian of Emily;  

   b. Defendant’s midweek overnight parenting time is eliminated and, if appropriate, replaced with reasonable non‑overnight contact that does not interfere with Emily’s schooling or activities;  

   c. Defendant’s alternate weekend parenting time is adjusted to better accommodate the increased distance between households and to reduce the burden of travel on the child, potentially including greater use of weekends, holidays, and school vacations; and  

   d. Any transportation responsibilities are allocated between the parties in a manner that minimizes disruption to the minor child;  

4. Order such further arrangements for holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time as the Court deems appropriate to ensure that Emily maintains a meaningful relationship with both parents consistent with her best interests;

5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.
