The opinion does not state that cart tracks or similar indications of age are needed or sufficient to establish constructive notice; indeed, it expressly rejects the need to prove how long the substance was on the floor.

The court holds that the negligent failure to secure the forklift could be found by the jury to be a culpable and direct cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, rejecting the argument that the intoxicated seaman\u2019s intervening act broke causation. This supports using Jesionek as authority that a defendant\u2019s negligence can be the direct and proximate cause of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries despite intervening third-party conduct.",
