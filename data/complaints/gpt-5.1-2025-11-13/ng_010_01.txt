COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant John Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff regularly walked along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant John Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides at and/or owns, possesses, or controls the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts 01201 (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, or exercised control over the large maple tree situated on the Property, including the branch that extended over and above the public sidewalk abutting the Property.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of personal injuries suffered by Plaintiff on or about August 12, 2023, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

5. The Berkshire Superior Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 when considering medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages.

6. Venue is proper in Berkshire County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 9 because the cause of action arose within Berkshire County and the Property where the incident occurred is located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 6 as if fully set forth herein.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, or was otherwise responsible for maintaining the tree located on or immediately adjacent to the Property at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

9. A large, old maple tree was situated in front of the Property, with a substantial branch (the “Subject Branch”) extending over and above the public sidewalk used by pedestrians, including Plaintiff.

10. For a significant period of time prior to August 12, 2023, the Subject Branch appeared cracked, drooping, and compromised, such that a reasonable person could observe that it posed a foreseeable risk of falling onto the sidewalk.

11. Plaintiff herself noticed that the Subject Branch was cracked and droopy during her regular walks along that sidewalk.

12. Neighbors of the Property also noticed the dangerous condition of the Subject Branch and, upon information and belief, expressed their concerns to Defendant.

13. Upon information and belief, one or more neighbors specifically told Defendant that the Subject Branch looked unsafe and suggested that Defendant contact an arborist or tree professional to inspect and/or remove the hazardous branch.

14. Upon information and belief, Defendant acknowledged these concerns and responded that he would “deal with it in the spring,” but failed to do so and took no appropriate corrective action.

15. Despite being on actual notice of the compromised condition of the Subject Branch and its location directly over a public sidewalk, Defendant did not have the tree or Subject Branch promptly inspected by an arborist or other competent professional.

16. Defendant did not remove, brace, trim, or otherwise remediate the Subject Branch to eliminate or reduce the risk that it would fall and injure persons lawfully using the public sidewalk.

17. Defendant also failed to warn pedestrians, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition of the Subject Branch.

18. On August 12, 2023, there was a summer thunderstorm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The weather conditions were typical of an ordinary summer thunderstorm and were not extreme, unprecedented, or of such severity as to be considered an “Act of God” of an extraordinary nature.

19. At approximately that date and during or around the time of the storm, Plaintiff was walking lawfully along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, carrying grocery bags.

20. As Plaintiff passed beneath or near the Subject Branch, the compromised branch suddenly snapped and fell from the tree.

21. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground and causing immediate pain and physical injury.

22. Plaintiff experienced a shoulder strain and multiple bruises as a result of the impact from the falling branch.

23. Plaintiff required medical evaluation and treatment as a direct and proximate result of the incident.

24. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses, including but not limited to emergency or urgent care, examinations, diagnostic evaluation, and follow‑up treatment.

25. Plaintiff was unable to work at her retail job for approximately one week due to her injuries and resulting limitations.

26. Plaintiff lost approximately $650 in wages as a direct and proximate result of the incident.

27. Plaintiff also experienced and continues to experience pain, discomfort, and physical limitations attributable to the injuries sustained when the Subject Branch fell.

28. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer emotional distress, inconvenience, and disruption of daily activities, including but not limited to difficulty performing ordinary tasks during her period of recovery.

29. The dangerous condition of the Subject Branch was open and obvious to a homeowner exercising reasonable care, and Defendant had ample opportunity before August 12, 2023 to remedy or mitigate the hazard.

30. Defendant’s failure to timely inspect, repair, or remove the Subject Branch, despite actual and constructive notice of the risk of it falling onto the sidewalk, created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and other foreseeable pedestrians.

31. The falling of the Subject Branch during an ordinary summer storm was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in managing and maintaining the tree and the Subject Branch.

32. Plaintiff, as a lawful user of the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s Property, was a foreseeable person to whom Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care in connection with conditions emanating from the Property.

33. Plaintiff in no way contributed to the dangerous condition of the Subject Branch.

34. Plaintiff acted reasonably and with due care for her own safety while walking on the public sidewalk.

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions as described herein, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress.

---

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (ONLY CAUSE OF ACTION)

36. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

37. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or person in control of real property owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to prevent foreseeable harm arising from conditions on the land or emanating from it. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–09 (1973).

38. Massachusetts has abolished the distinction between invitees and licensees for purposes of premises liability, and Defendant owed Plaintiff the duty of reasonable care as a lawful user of the sidewalk adjacent to his premises. *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 707–09.

39. A landowner also owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to persons outside the premises caused by artificial or dangerous natural conditions that the landowner knows or should know pose an unreasonable risk. See *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196, 198–200 (1994); *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84, 87–88 (1988).

40. This duty includes the obligation to take reasonable steps to inspect and remedy dangerous trees or branches overhanging areas where people are foreseeably present, such as public walkways. See *Giusti v. Weston*, 165 Mass. 551, 553–54 (1896) (recognizing potential liability where a landowner permits dangerous objects to fall onto public ways); *Harvard Furniture Co. v. Wrenn*, 192 Mass. 387, 389–90 (1906).

41. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the inspection, maintenance, and control of the tree and Subject Branch extending over the public sidewalk.

#### Breach

42. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by failing to timely inspect, maintain, or remove the visibly cracked and drooping Subject Branch despite actual knowledge of its compromised condition and specific warnings from neighbors.

43. Defendant breached his duty by failing to hire an arborist or other qualified professional to evaluate the tree and Subject Branch when a reasonably prudent homeowner would have done so under similar circumstances.

44. Defendant breached his duty by failing to remove, trim, or otherwise remediate the Subject Branch even after acknowledging he would “deal with it in the spring,” thereby allowing the hazard to persist into and through the summer of 2023.

45. Defendant breached his duty by failing to warn or protect pedestrians, including Plaintiff, from the known and foreseeable risk that the Subject Branch could fall onto the sidewalk.

46. Defendant’s failure to remedy the hazardous condition over a prolonged period constitutes a failure to exercise the reasonable care expected of a landowner under Massachusetts law. See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013) (landowners must act reasonably to prevent foreseeable harm); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378–79 (2010) (duty of reasonable care applies to all hazards on property).

47. Defendant cannot avoid liability by characterizing the incident as solely due to weather, because the storm was a typical summer thunderstorm and the dangerous condition of the Subject Branch existed long beforehand and was known or should have been known to Defendant. See *Wynn v. Sullivan*, 294 Mass. 562, 565–66 (1936) (no “Act of God” defense where defendant’s negligence combined with natural forces); *Lane v. Atlantic Works*, 111 Mass. 136, 141–42 (1872).

#### Causation

48. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of the Subject Branch falling onto the sidewalk on August 12, 2023.

49. But for Defendant’s failure to inspect and remove or remediate the cracked and drooping Subject Branch, the branch would not have fallen in the manner and at the time that it did, and Plaintiff would not have been injured.

50. The risk that a compromised tree branch might fall during a normal storm and injure a pedestrian on the sidewalk beneath it is precisely the type of harm that makes Defendant’s conduct negligent and was reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–50 (2006) (foreseeability of harm central to duty and proximate cause); *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996).

51. No intervening, superseding cause broke the chain of causation between Defendant’s negligence and Plaintiff’s injuries.

#### Damages

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain and multiple bruises when the Subject Branch fell and struck her.

53. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to evaluation and treatment of her injuries. See G.L. c. 231, § 6D (allowing recovery for personal injuries including medical expenses for non‑motor‑vehicle incidents).

54. Plaintiff lost approximately $650 in wages as a result of being unable to work at her retail job for roughly one week following the incident.

55. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and limitations associated with her injuries, including pain in the affected shoulder and back.

56. Plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life related to the incident, the sudden and traumatic impact of being struck and knocked to the ground, and the resulting physical limitations.

57. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and all other losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, pursuant to Massachusetts common law. See, e.g., *Rodrigues v. Scudder Bay Syndicate*, 387 Mass. 941, 944–45 (1983); *Goltz v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 413 Mass. 88, 91–92 (1992).

58. Plaintiff is also entitled to statutory prejudgment interest on any judgment at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of commencement of this action, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

59. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence and to adjust the specific amount of damages claimed as discovery and further information become available.

---

### V. LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES (MASSACHUSETTS STATUTES & CASE LAW)

60. Plaintiff’s claim for negligence is grounded in Massachusetts common law and statutes, including but not limited to:

   a. **G.L. c. 231, § 85** (comparative negligence), which provides that Plaintiff’s contributory negligence, if any, does not bar recovery unless it exceeds Defendant’s negligence, and that damages shall be diminished in proportion to Plaintiff’s negligence, if applicable.

   b. **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**, providing for prejudgment interest in tort actions for personal injuries.

   c. **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, providing subject‑matter jurisdiction in the Superior Court for civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.

   d. **G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, 9**, governing proper venue in Berkshire County where the cause of action arose and the Property is located.

61. The following Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court decisions support Plaintiff’s negligence claim and the legal duties alleged herein, among others:

   a. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) – abolishing the invitee/licensee distinction and imposing a duty of reasonable care owed by landowners to all lawful visitors.

   c. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) – affirming that landowners must act reasonably to prevent foreseeable harm to others.

   d. *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196 (1994) – recognizing a landowner’s duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm caused by conditions on the land that present foreseeable risks to persons in adjacent areas.

   e. *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) – addressing landowner liability for conditions on property creating risk to persons in public areas.

   f. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) – discussing duty and foreseeability, and the obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent harm where risk is reasonably foreseeable.

   g. *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996) – explaining foreseeability and proximate cause in negligence actions.

   h. *Wynn v. Sullivan*, 294 Mass. 562 (1936) – holding that a defendant cannot rely on an “Act of God” defense when the defendant’s negligence combines with natural forces to cause harm.

   i. *Lane v. Atlantic Works*, 111 Mass. 136 (1872) – addressing liability where defendant’s negligence, combined with natural forces, results in injury.

   j. *Giusti v. Weston*, 165 Mass. 551 (1896), and *Harvard Furniture Co. v. Wrenn*, 192 Mass. 387 (1906) – recognizing a landowner’s potential liability for objects or conditions on the land that fall or project onto public ways and cause injury.

   k. *Rodrigues v. Scudder Bay Syndicate*, 387 Mass. 941 (1983), and *Goltz v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 413 Mass. 88 (1992) – confirming a plaintiff’s right to recover damages for personal injury, including pain and suffering, in negligence actions.
