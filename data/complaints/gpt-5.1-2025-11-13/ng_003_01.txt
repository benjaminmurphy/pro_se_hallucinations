v.  

HOMEGOODS DISCOUNT STORE,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Jason Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jason Thompson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and business invitee at Defendant’s retail premises located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

2. On information and belief, Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store is a business entity operating a discount home-goods retail store at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, and is engaged in the business of selling household goods, including boxed kitchen appliances, to the general public for profit.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the premises located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action sounding in negligence for personal injury.

5. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 212, § 3, the Lowell District Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the cause of action arose in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, where the Premises are located and where Plaintiff’s injuries occurred.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff lawfully entered Defendant’s store located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, as a paying customer and business invitee to browse and purchase household goods.

8. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was exercising due care for his own safety.

9. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, had stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances—including, without limitation, toaster ovens—on shelving in the kitchen section of the store, to a height of approximately five or six boxes.

10. These heavy boxes were stacked vertically on shelves without proper restraints, straps, rails, guards, safety bars, or other devices to prevent the boxes from falling into the aisle where customers walk.

11. The stacked boxes were unstable, top-heavy, and susceptible to falling with ordinary contact or vibration, creating an unreasonably dangerous condition for customers in the aisle below.

12. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that stacking multiple heavy boxes of appliances in this manner without proper securing mechanisms posed a foreseeable risk that the boxes could fall and injure customers.

13. On September 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was standing in the kitchen aisle examining merchandise, another customer was pushing a shopping cart in the same aisle.

14. The other customer’s cart made a normal, minor contact with one of the lower shelves; the impact was not excessive or abnormal for a retail environment.

15. As a result of the ordinary contact with the shelf, at least one large box containing a toaster oven, which had been stacked by Defendant’s employees near the top of the shelving, fell from an elevated height.

16. The falling toaster-oven box struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of his head.

17. Immediately upon being struck, Plaintiff became dizzy and developed a severe headache.

18. Plaintiff reported the incident and his symptoms to store personnel. The store manager came to the scene, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.

19. The store manager did not summon emergency medical services, despite Plaintiff’s complaints of dizziness and head pain, and did not advise Plaintiff to seek immediate medical attention.

20. That evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, including increased headache and discomfort in his shoulder, prompting him to seek care at a hospital emergency department.

21. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was evaluated, diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain, and provided treatment and medical advice.

22. As a direct and proximate result of the incident at Defendant’s store, Plaintiff suffered injuries including, but not limited to, a mild concussion, shoulder strain, headaches, dizziness, pain, discomfort, and other physical and emotional symptoms.

23. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for diagnosis and treatment of his injuries, including emergency room services and follow-up care.

24. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed as a delivery driver.

25. Due to his injuries and medical restrictions, Plaintiff was unable to work for several days following the incident, resulting in lost wages of approximately $1,200.

26. Plaintiff also was unable to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month, causing loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and emotional distress.

27. Defendant, acting through its employees and agents, was responsible for the stocking, arrangement, inspection, and maintenance of the shelves and boxed merchandise in the area where Plaintiff was injured.

28. Defendant failed to use reasonable care in stacking and securing the heavy boxed merchandise and in maintaining the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees like Plaintiff.

29. Defendant either knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that heavy boxed appliances stacked several boxes high without safety restraints on shelves accessible to customers posed an unreasonable risk that boxes could fall into the aisle from a height and injure customers.

30. The risk that a shopping cart or person might bump or contact store shelving in the ordinary course of shopping was foreseeable to Defendant.

31. The fall of the toaster-oven box was a foreseeable and preventable result of Defendant’s failure to properly stock, secure, and maintain the merchandise and shelving.

32. Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
**(Negligence – Premises Liability)**

33. Plaintiff incorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully set forth herein.

34. Under Massachusetts law, a store owner owes a duty to lawful business invitees to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to protect them against foreseeable risks of harm. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 165–66 (1980).

35. Defendant, as owner and operator of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to:

   a. Exercise reasonable care in stacking, displaying, and securing merchandise, including heavy boxed appliances, so as not to create an unreasonably dangerous condition;  
   
   b. Inspect the shelving and stacked merchandise at reasonable intervals to detect and remedy unsafe conditions;  
   
   c. Maintain the Premises, including aisles and shelves, in a reasonably safe condition for customers; and  
   
   d. Protect customers from reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the risk of falling merchandise caused by ordinary customer activity such as moving shopping carts along store aisles.

36. A reasonable store owner in Defendant’s position would foresee that stacking heavy and bulky boxes of appliances five or six high on open shelves without protective bars, restraints, or other safety devices could cause the boxes to become unstable and fall, particularly if shelves were subject to normal contacts from customers and shopping carts.

37. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff, including, but not limited to, in the following respects:

   a. Negligently stacking and arranging heavy boxes of kitchen appliances in an unstable and dangerous manner on high shelves;  
   
   b. Failing to use readily available safety measures—such as guard rails, straps, safety bars, or other restraints—to prevent boxed merchandise from falling into customer aisles;  
   
   c. Failing to adequately inspect and monitor the condition and stability of the stacked boxes and shelving;  
   
   d. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable policies and procedures for safe stocking and merchandising of heavy boxed goods;  
   
   e. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other customers of the risk of falling merchandise from the high shelves; and  
   
   f. Otherwise failing to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent store owner would exercise under like circumstances.

38. Under Massachusetts premises-liability principles, a store’s duty of reasonable care includes liability where its own mode of operation and merchandising creates a foreseeable risk of harm to customers, even absent proof that it had actual notice of the specific falling item. See, e.g., *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 784–86 (2007) (recognizing that a proprietor may be liable when its chosen method of operation makes the occurrence of a dangerous condition foreseeable, and the plaintiff need not prove notice of the specific hazard created by that method).

39. Defendant’s practice of stacking multiple heavy boxes of appliances vertically and unsecured on shelves in active aisles, where shelves are routinely contacted by customer carts, is a negligent mode of operation presenting a foreseeable hazard of falling merchandise.

40. Under *Sheehan* and related authority, Defendant is liable where:

   a. Its mode of operation made the existence of a dangerous condition reasonably foreseeable;  
   
   b. It failed to take reasonable measures to prevent or remedy the condition; and  
   
   c. Plaintiff was injured as a result of that condition. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 785–86.

41. Defendant also had a duty under Massachusetts common law to maintain its premises “in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk.” *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 343; see *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 52–53 (1983) (adopting § 343 standard in premises-liability context).

42. Defendant violated its duty under the above standards by failing to take simple, low-burden measures—such as lower stacking of heavy boxes or use of safety rails or restraints—which would have significantly reduced the risk of serious injury to customers from falling merchandise.

43. Massachusetts law provides that a business proprietor must protect invitees against dangers of which it knows or reasonably should know. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371–72 (2010); *Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).

44. Defendant either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the manner in which the heavy boxes were stacked created an unreasonable risk that they would fall and injure customers, especially with ordinary contact to the shelving.

45. Plaintiff was injured as a direct and foreseeable result of this dangerous condition created and maintained by Defendant.

46. The falling toaster-oven box and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries would not have occurred in the absence of negligence by Defendant in stocking, securing, and maintaining the merchandise and shelving.

47. Plaintiff was at all relevant times acting reasonably and did not cause or contribute to the creation of the dangerous condition.

48. To the extent Defendant asserts comparative negligence or comparative fault, Plaintiff denies any such allegation. Nonetheless, even if Plaintiff were found to be partially at fault, which he expressly denies, Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, provides that Plaintiff may still recover damages so long as his negligence, if any, was not greater than the total negligence of Defendant, and such damages would be diminished only in proportion to any such negligence.

49. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, as described above, were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain:

   a. Bodily injury, including a mild concussion, shoulder strain, pain, headache, dizziness, and other symptoms;  
   
   b. Medical expenses, past and future, currently estimated at approximately $2,500 and subject to further proof at trial, which are recoverable under G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 60F;  
   
   c. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $1,200 in lost wages as a delivery driver;  
   
   d. Physical pain and suffering;  
   
   e. Mental anguish and emotional distress;  
   
   f. Loss of enjoyment of life, including the inability to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month; and  
   
   g. Other damages to be determined at trial, all recoverable under Massachusetts negligence law. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 547–48 (1982) (discussing elements of negligence and compensable harms); *Tassone v. Tufts Assocs., Inc.*, 408 Mass. 146, 149 (1990).

51. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all of the above damages in accordance with Massachusetts law governing negligence and personal injury actions. See *Glicklich v. Spievack*, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 495–96 (1983); *Wadsworth v. Boston Gas Co.*, 352 Mass. 86, 93 (1967).

   i. *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (adoption of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 and duty to protect invitees from foreseeable harm);

   n. *Wadsworth v. Boston Gas Co.*, 352 Mass. 86 (1967) (duty and foreseeability in negligence actions).

53. These authorities, together with other applicable Massachusetts statutes and case law, support Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant owed him a duty of reasonable care, breached that duty by negligently stacking and securing merchandise, and thereby caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
