COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody – Material Change in Circumstances)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Greene (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, James Greene (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Samantha Greene, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, James Greene, is an individual believed to reside in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   a. Emily Greene, born ____________, age 12 (“the minor child”).

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209, § 37, and G.L. c. 215, § 3, as the original custody order was issued by this Court, the parties and the minor child reside in Massachusetts, and the matter concerns the custody and best interests of a Massachusetts child.

5. On or about May 15, 2018, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court entered a judgment and/or order (the “2018 Custody Order”) providing for legal and physical custody of the minor child, Emily Greene.

6. The 2018 Custody Order provided, in relevant part, that the parties would share joint legal custody and joint physical custody of the minor child on a 50/50 basis, with an alternating week-on/week-off parenting-time schedule.

7. The 2018 Custody Order was entered at a time when both parties lived in close proximity to each other, were generally healthy, and were fully physically able to care for the minor child without significant limitation.

8. This Complaint for Modification is filed pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, seeking a modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions due to a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child.

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since the entry of the 2018 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances concerning the Defendant Father’s health and physical capacity to safely care for the minor child, warranting modification of the physical custody and parenting schedule.

10. Specifically, in or about the recent past, Father was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that affects his mobility, balance, and physical ability to respond quickly in situations that may require immediate action to ensure the child’s safety.

11. Father has experienced multiple falls in his home as a result of this neurological condition, including falls in the presence of, or in connection with the care of, the minor child.

12. Father’s treating medical providers have advised him that, due to his neurological condition, he should not be alone with the minor child in areas near stairs or in other situations requiring quick physical response to ensure the safety of the child.

13. Notwithstanding these medical limitations and recommendations, Father continues to insist on exercising the same alternating week-on/week-off 50/50 physical custody schedule that was implemented when both parties were healthy and fully physically capable.

14. During Father’s parenting time, he has on multiple occasions relied upon the parties’ twelve-year-old daughter, Emily, to assist him with tasks related to his mobility and personal care, including, but not limited to, helping him move between his wheelchair and his bed and bringing him items that he is not physically able to retrieve independently.

15. This pattern has placed inappropriate physical and emotional responsibilities on the minor child, effectively requiring her to act, in part, as a caregiver to her parent rather than being cared for as a child.

16. The minor child has expressed, by her words, behavior, or both, observable stress and concern related to Father’s physical condition, his falls, and her perceived responsibility to assist him, which impacts her sense of safety and emotional well-being in Father’s home.

17. The Father’s progressive neurological condition is, by its nature, expected to worsen or at least remain significantly limiting over time, rather than improve, thus making the current 50/50 physical custody schedule increasingly inconsistent with the minor child’s safety and best interests.

18. The 50/50 alternating-week schedule was premised upon circumstances that no longer exist—specifically, Father’s prior ability to independently and safely care for the minor child without exposing her to heightened risk or inappropriate caretaking roles.

19. Under Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior order, and that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

20. Father’s progressive neurological condition, his documented falls, his physician’s restrictions concerning supervision of the minor child, and his reliance on the minor child for adult-level physical assistance collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s safety and welfare since the entry of the 2018 Custody Order.

21. Continuation of the existing 50/50 physical custody arrangement without modification places the minor child at increased risk of physical harm if Father is unable to respond quickly to emergencies (for example, falls, accidents on or near stairs, or other incidents that may require immediate adult intervention).

22. Continuation of the existing arrangement also risks ongoing emotional and psychological harm to the minor child, given her age (12), her awareness of Father’s condition, and her repeated exposure to his falls and functional limitations while feeling obligated to “help” or “take care of” him.

23. The minor child’s developmental stage and her right to experience childhood free from undue parental caregiving burdens are significant factors the Court must consider when determining her best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003).

24. The Mother does not seek to terminate or restrict Father’s relationship with the minor child, but rather to adjust the physical custody and parenting schedule so that the child’s primary residence and the bulk of her daily care are handled in a setting where there is no material question about the caregiver’s physical capacity to ensure safety and provide appropriate supervision.

25. The Mother is able and willing to assume primary physical custody of the minor child and to ensure that the minor child maintains a loving and consistent relationship with Father through parenting time structured in a manner that is safe and appropriate in light of Father’s medical condition.

### III. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

26. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or visitation determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843.

27. The Supreme Judicial Court has further held that, where modification of custody is sought, the Court must determine whether there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and whether the proposed modification will serve the child’s best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 182–83 (2006).

28. Factors relevant to the best-interests analysis include the child’s safety; the child’s emotional, mental, and physical needs; the stability of each home environment; and each parent’s ability to provide appropriate care. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–45; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998).

29. The Father’s progressive neurological condition directly impacts his physical ability to respond quickly and effectively to potential safety hazards involving the minor child, particularly around stairs, in emergencies, or in situations requiring immediate physical intervention.

30. The recommendations of Father’s medical provider regarding his need to avoid being alone with the minor child near stairs or in situations requiring quick physical response are highly relevant to the Court’s best-interests analysis and weigh in favor of modifying physical custody to reduce risk to the child.

31. The minor child is 12 years old and requires a home environment in which she is not exposed to undue safety risks and is not asked to perform tasks that are more properly the responsibility of an adult caregiver.

32. It is not in the minor child’s best interests to be placed repeatedly in the position of assisting with transfers from wheelchair to bed or similar adult-care tasks for Father during regular parenting time, as this effectively reverses parental and child roles and may cause long-term emotional harm.

33. The Mother has consistently provided a safe, stable, and nurturing home for the minor child and is able to meet the child’s physical, emotional, educational, and developmental needs on a primary basis.

34. The Mother resides in a setting where she is physically capable of supervising the minor child in all relevant contexts, including stairs, emergencies, and everyday routines, without reliance on the minor child for physical assistance or safety.

35. Maintaining joint legal custody and a meaningful parenting relationship between Father and the minor child, while transitioning to primary physical custody with Mother, is consistent with Massachusetts law’s preference for continued parental involvement where appropriate and safe. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 548–49 (2010).

36. The requested modification will promote the minor child’s safety, emotional well-being, and stability by ensuring that her primary residence is with the parent who can independently provide comprehensive physical care and supervision at all times.

37. At the same time, the requested modification will preserve and protect the minor child’s relationship with Father by providing him with parenting time that is reasonably adjusted to his physical limitations, potentially with appropriate supports or conditions to maximize safety.

38. The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that where changed circumstances pose potential risk to a child’s welfare, the Court may modify custody to prioritize safety while still fostering the child’s relationship with both parents. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 596–97; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 183–84.

39. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific and documented changes arising from Father’s progressive neurological condition and is not punitive or intended to diminish Father’s importance in the child’s life.

40. In light of the material changes since 2018 and the current circumstances, continuation of the alternating-week 50/50 physical custody arrangement is no longer in the minor child’s best interests under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant case law.

### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

41. G.L. c. 208, § 28 authorizes this Court to modify any prior judgment for custody or visitation upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that the modification is in the best interests of the child. See also Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507, 510–11 (2013).

42. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a party seeking modification of custody bears the burden of demonstrating: (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that the requested change is necessary in the child’s best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 182–83; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262 (2001).

43. The Father’s progressive neurological diagnosis, the occurrence of falls, the physician’s instructions that he not be alone with the child in certain higher‑risk situations, and his reliance on the parties’ twelve‑year‑old daughter for physical assistance constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not contemplated at the time of the 2018 Custody Order.

44. The impact of Father’s condition on his ability to safely supervise the minor child, particularly near stairs or in emergent situations, is a significant factor that this Court must consider in determining whether modification is warranted. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–45.

45. Where the child’s safety or emotional well-being may be compromised under the existing arrangement, Massachusetts law authorizes the Court to revise custody and parenting time to protect the child’s best interests. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 596–97.

46. The requested modification is consistent with the principle that custody and parenting-time orders are always subject to revision as the needs of the child and the capacities of the parents evolve over time. See Haas v. Puchalski, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555, 557–58 (1980); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 402–03.

47. The Mother’s proposed custodial arrangement—granting her primary physical custody, maintaining joint legal custody (unless otherwise ordered), and affording Father parenting time adjusted to his physical ability—strikes an appropriate balance between safeguarding the child’s safety and preserving her bond with Father.

48. The requested modification is further supported by the Court’s equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6, allowing it to fashion orders necessary to protect the welfare of minor children subject to its jurisdiction.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Samantha Greene, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2018 Custody Order, specifically relating to the Defendant Father’s progressive neurological condition, his diminished physical capacity, and the resulting impact on the safety and welfare of the minor child.

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Greene.

3. Modify the 2018 Custody Order to award the Plaintiff Mother primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Greene.

4. Order that the parties shall continue to share joint legal custody of the minor child, unless and until further order of the Court, so long as such arrangement remains consistent with the child’s best interests and the parties’ ability to cooperate regarding major decisions affecting the child’s welfare.

5. Establish a revised parenting-time schedule for the Defendant Father that:  
   a. Provides the Father with reasonable and meaningful parenting time with the minor child;  
   b. Takes into account Father’s current and anticipated physical limitations and his physician’s recommendations regarding safety (including avoidance of situations where he is alone with the child in areas involving stairs or other high‑risk conditions); and  
   c. Minimizes the need for the minor child to perform physical caregiving tasks for Father or to be exposed to unreasonable safety risks.

6. Order that Father’s parenting time, to the extent necessary for the minor child’s safety, may be subject to such reasonable conditions as the Court deems appropriate, which may include, but are not limited to:  
   a. Limiting overnight parenting time unless and until Father demonstrates appropriate supports or accommodations are in place;  
   b. Requiring that another responsible adult be present during certain activities that involve stairs or other high‑risk environments; and/or  
   c. Any other conditions necessary to ensure the minor child’s physical and emotional safety.

7. Grant such temporary orders as may be necessary pending final adjudication of this Complaint for Modification, including temporary adjustment of physical custody and parenting time to protect the minor child’s immediate safety and welfare.

8. Order that the parties participate in co‑parenting counseling, family counseling, or any other supportive services the Court deems appropriate to assist the family in adjusting to the new custodial arrangement and Father’s medical condition, if such services are available and in the child’s best interests.

9. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief—legal or equitable—as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child.

### VI. VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE

I, Samantha Greene, hereby certify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the factual statements contained in this Complaint for Modification are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
