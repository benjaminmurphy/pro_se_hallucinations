SUSAN BLAKE,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Carter, proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Susan Blake and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Carter (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 45 Waverly Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Defendant, Susan Blake (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and at all relevant times was the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The premises that are the subject of this action are located in Roxbury, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court.

5. Pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 20, the Boston Housing Court has jurisdiction over this action because it concerns residential rental property in Boston and alleges violations of state landlord‑tenant law related to the condition and use of the leased premises.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the premises are located in Boston and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Boston. See G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 185C, § 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a basement apartment located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times used the Premises as his primary residence.

10. As landlord of the Premises, Defendant owed Plaintiff all duties imposed by Massachusetts common law, the implied warranty of habitability, G.L. c. 186, and applicable state and local sanitary and building codes, including but not limited to the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. See Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

11. Plaintiff acknowledges that in or about October 2025, his rent payment was approximately two weeks late due to medical expenses. Plaintiff paid the full October rent together with any late fee assessed by Defendant, and Defendant accepted this payment and continued the tenancy.

12. Beginning in or about November 2025, Plaintiff observed water seeping into the Premises through a basement wall whenever there was heavy rain.

13. The water infiltration caused visible dampness and wet spots along the wall and floor and created a persistent moisture problem inside the Premises.

14. Continuous dampness and water seepage in a basement apartment render the dwelling unit unhealthy and unfit for human habitation and violate the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 CMR 410.200 (prohibiting chronic dampness and water penetration), 105 CMR 410.500 et seq. (structural requirements), and related provisions requiring the landlord to maintain the premises in a safe, sanitary, and weather‑tight condition.

15. The water infiltration damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including at least one rug and a bookshelf located against the affected wall, with total damage of approximately $400.

16. In response to the water problem, Plaintiff has been forced to run a dehumidifier on a near‑constant basis to try to limit mold, mildew, and further damage, which has increased Plaintiff’s electric usage and costs.

17. Promptly after discovering the water seepage in November 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the problem via text message. Plaintiff informed Defendant that water was seeping through the basement wall during heavy rain and that there was an ongoing moisture problem.

18. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but did not, within a reasonable time, make repairs or otherwise correct the water infiltration.

19. After several weeks passed with no effective action by Defendant to repair the condition, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston to report the water infiltration and related issues, reasonably believing that the condition violated housing and sanitary codes.

20. A municipal inspector came to the Premises, observed the conditions, and identified the water infiltration problem as well as other code‑related issues at the property.

21. Defendant was made aware, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been aware, of the City’s inspection and of the code violations found at the Premises.

22. Notwithstanding notice from Plaintiff and the involvement of city inspectors, Defendant has failed and continues to fail to correct the water infiltration and persistent dampness in the Premises.

23. The continued water seepage and dampness have interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use important portions of the Premises, including the affected wall and floor area, for ordinary residential purposes such as placing furniture and storing personal belongings without risk of damage.

24. The conditions have caused Plaintiff substantial discomfort, inconvenience, and anxiety concerning potential mold, structural problems, and health effects.

25. Instead of promptly correcting the conditions, Defendant has characterized Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” because he contacted the City regarding the conditions.

26. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that she does not intend to renew his lease when it expires in March 2026 (Plaintiff’s lease having begun on March 1, 2022, and currently set to end in March 2026), asserting that the non‑renewal is due to Plaintiff’s late rent in October 2025.

27. The timing of Defendant’s decision not to renew the lease closely followed Plaintiff’s complaints about the water infiltration and the subsequent inspection by City officials.

28. Plaintiff believes, and therefore alleges, that Defendant’s decision not to renew the lease and her characterization of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” were substantially motivated by Plaintiff’s protected conduct in complaining about conditions and contacting municipal authorities, rather than by the isolated late payment in October 2025.

29. At all relevant times, Defendant’s actions and omissions were intentional or, at a minimum, in reckless or callous disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant and of her legal obligations as a landlord.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to repair the water infiltration and her related conduct, Plaintiff has suffered:  
    a. Loss and damage to personal property (including the rug and bookshelf) in an amount of approximately $400;  
    b. Additional utility expenses for running a dehumidifier;  
    c. Loss of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises; and  
    d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, annoyance, and disruption of quiet enjoyment.

31. Plaintiff has performed all obligations required of him under the lease and applicable law, except to the extent that his performance has been excused or diminished by Defendant’s material breach of legal duties.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–31 as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” The statute provides that a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy in Massachusetts and protects a tenant’s right to freedom from serious and substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

35. Constructive interference with quiet enjoyment may arise from conditions within the landlord’s control that “substantially impair the character and value of the leased premises” and that the landlord fails to remedy within a reasonable time after notice, including violations of the State Sanitary Code. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–02 (1979); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

36. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that serious housing code violations and uncorrected moisture, leaks, and unsanitary conditions can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–78 (1994); Brown v. LeClair, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 977–78 (1985); Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 198–200.

37. Pursuant to G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., landlords are obligated to maintain residential premises in compliance with health and safety standards. Failure to maintain the premises in compliance with these standards, after notice, is evidence of interference with quiet enjoyment and breach of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 775–77; McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth., 429 Mass. 300, 305–06 (1999).

38. Here, Defendant knew or should have known of the chronic water infiltration and dampness in the Premises after notice from Plaintiff and the City inspector, yet failed to take timely and effective steps to correct the problem.

39. The ongoing water penetration, dampness, and related unsanitary conditions materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use of portions of the Premises, damaged his property, required additional expenditures, and created health and safety concerns, thereby constituting a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

40. Defendant’s failure to repair the conditions, together with her characterization of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and her decision not to renew the lease soon after Plaintiff sought municipal assistance, collectively constitute at least an indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord’s interference with quiet enjoyment need not be accompanied by actual physical eviction; indirect actions, omissions, or conditions that substantially impair the tenant’s comfort, safety, or use of the premises are sufficient. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

42. In addition, Massachusetts law protects tenants who report code violations or contact public authorities regarding housing conditions from retaliatory conduct by landlords, and such retaliation may constitute a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 18; Sanitary Code enforcement provisions, G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; see also Spence v. Gormley, 387 Mass. 258, 262–64 (1982) (discussing landlord retaliation based on tenant’s protected activity).

43. Defendant’s threat of non‑renewal and her description of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” closely following his complaints and the City inspection support the inference that Defendant’s actions were substantially motivated by Plaintiff’s exercise of his rights, and constitute further interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

44. Defendant’s conduct was willful, intentional, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related statutes.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Property damage of approximately $400;  
    b. Increased utility costs;  
    c. Loss of value and enjoyment of the Premises; and  
    d. Emotional distress, discomfort, and inconvenience.

46. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either his actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200; three months’ rent is therefore $3,600.

47. Plaintiff is also entitled to recover costs of this action, and, where applicable, reasonable attorney’s fees under G.L. c. 186, § 14. Although Plaintiff is presently self‑represented, he reserves the right to seek attorney’s fees if he later retains counsel, or to seek recovery of reasonable litigation costs allowable to pro se litigants.
