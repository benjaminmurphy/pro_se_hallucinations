  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - Sophie Johnson, age 10 (hereinafter “Sophie” or “the minor child”).

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6; and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable), as the original custody and parenting‑time orders were entered by this Court and the minor child continues to reside within the Commonwealth.

5. On or about May 15, 2016, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court entered a judgment and/or order concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time of the parties’ minor child (the “2016 Custody Order”).

6. Under the 2016 Custody Order, the parties’ minor child’s primary residence was awarded to Father, with Mother receiving limited parenting time consisting of weekend visits and one weeknight dinner per week.

7. Mother brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, seeking modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2016 Custody Order, and that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child.

### II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. At the time of the 2016 Custody Order, Sophie was approximately four (4) years old.

9. At that time, Mother was enrolled in graduate school, had a demanding and inflexible academic schedule, and was living in a small studio apartment that was not ideal for extended overnights with a young child.

10. The 2016 Custody Order, including the limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner, reflected the circumstances existing at that time—specifically, Mother’s then‑unstable housing, lack of a flexible schedule, and her status as a full‑time graduate student.

11. Since the entry of the 2016 Custody Order, there has been a substantial and material change in Mother’s circumstances, in the child’s development and expressed preferences, and in the child’s emotional needs and relationship with both parents.

12. Mother has successfully completed her graduate education and is no longer a student.

13. Mother is now employed in a stable job with normal, predictable hours, which allows her to be available for Sophie before and after school, as well as on weekends and evenings.

14. Mother’s current employment and schedule are significantly different from, and more stable than, her circumstances at the time of the 2016 Custody Order.

15. Mother now resides in a two‑bedroom apartment, and Sophie has her own bedroom when she is with Mother.

16. Mother’s current home provides a safe, stable, and appropriate environment for Sophie to spend regular and extended overnight parenting time.

17. Since the entry of the 2016 Custody Order, Sophie has grown from a four‑year‑old child into a ten‑year‑old child of school age, with increasing emotional, social, and developmental needs, and with her own views and preferences regarding her relationship with each parent.

18. Over the years since the 2016 Custody Order, Mother and Sophie have developed a strong, loving, and close bond.

19. Sophie is currently in therapy with a licensed mental health professional.

20. Sophie’s therapist has informed Mother that Sophie experiences emotional distress and feelings of guilt related to the limited nature of her visits with Mother and the need to leave Mother after short visits.

21. According to Sophie’s therapist, Sophie has expressed a consistent desire to spend more time with Mother, including additional overnights in Mother’s home.

22. Sophie has expressed to Mother that she wishes to spend more time with Mother, including more overnights and longer, more regular contact.

23. Sophie has, upon information and belief, written a letter to the Court expressing her desire for increased parenting time and overnights with Mother.

24. When Sophie attempts to discuss her desire to spend more time with Mother with Father, Father becomes angry, dismissive, and refuses to engage in productive discussion regarding any modification to the schedule.

25. Father has refused to participate meaningfully in any effort to adjust or expand Mother’s parenting time on a voluntary basis, despite Mother’s changed circumstances and Sophie’s clearly expressed wishes.

26. The current parenting schedule—limited weekend visits and a single weeknight dinner—no longer reflects the realities of Mother’s life, Sophie’s developmental stage, or Sophie’s emotional needs.

27. The original reasons justifying primary residence with Father and limited parenting time for Mother—Mother’s graduate school obligations, lack of a stable schedule, and inadequate housing—no longer exist.

28. The totality of the changes in Mother’s circumstances, Sophie’s age and evolving needs, and the child’s expressed preferences constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2016 Custody Order.

29. Continued adherence to the 2016 Custody Order, without modification, is detrimental to Sophie’s emotional well‑being and contrary to her best interests, as it restricts her ability to maintain a meaningful, close, and consistent relationship with Mother.

30. Mother is able and willing to facilitate Sophie’s relationship with Father and to comply with a parenting schedule that maximizes Sophie’s best interests and emotional health.

31. Mother seeks a modification that provides for substantially increased parenting time and overnights with Mother, while maintaining Sophie’s important relationship with Father.

### III. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION

32. Under Massachusetts law, a court may modify an existing custody or parenting‑time order upon a showing of (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.  
   See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996).

33. The best interests of the child are the “paramount concern” of the Court in custody and parenting‑time determinations.  
   See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

34. A material and substantial change in circumstances may include changes in a parent’s stability, employment, housing, and ability to care for the child, as well as the child’s age, developmental needs, and expressed preferences.  
   See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191–92 (1998); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 547–48 (2010); Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 870–71 (2006).

35. The Court may consider the child’s preferences, particularly as the child grows older and more mature, as one factor in the best‑interests analysis.  
   See Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243–44 (2000); Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406, 409–10 (1976).

36. Consistent with these standards, where the original custody arrangement was based on circumstances that have significantly changed—such as a parent’s completion of education, attainment of stable employment, and improved housing—the Court may modify custody and parenting time to reflect the current realities and the child’s best interests.  
   See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–39.

37. The Court is also guided by the general policy that children should have “frequent and continuing contact” with both parents, when consistent with the child’s best interests.  
   See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43; Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402–03 (1981).

38. In addition, the Court may consider the extent to which each parent is willing and able to support the child’s relationship with the other parent. A parent’s unwillingness to consider reasonable adjustments to parenting time that serve the child’s best interests is a relevant factor.  
   See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 263–64 (2001); Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 741.

39. Here, Mother has demonstrated a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2016 Custody Order, including:  
   a. completion of graduate school;  
   b. secure and stable employment with regular hours;  
   c. a suitable two‑bedroom home where the child has her own bedroom;  
   d. the development of a strong, close relationship between Sophie and Mother;  
   e. Sophie’s increased age and maturity;  
   f. Sophie’s ongoing therapy and emotional needs; and  
   g. Sophie’s expressed desire for more time and overnights with Mother.

40. These changes are precisely the type of developments recognized under Massachusetts law as supporting modification of custody and parenting‑time orders.  
   See Rosenberg, 428 Mass. at 191–92; Smith, 458 Mass. at 547–48; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Pizzino, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 870–71.

41. It is in Sophie’s best interests that her relationship with Mother be fostered through more frequent and extended parenting time, including regular overnights, so that she may benefit from the love, guidance, and support of both parents.  
   See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–43; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26; Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 402–03.

42. Modification of the current order to provide increased parenting time and overnights with Mother will promote Sophie’s emotional well‑being, accommodate her expressed preferences, and better reflect the present circumstances of both parents and the child.

43. Leaving the 2016 Custody Order in place, without adjustment, would perpetuate a parenting arrangement that is based on old circumstances, does not meet Sophie’s current needs, and is contrary to her clearly expressed wishes, as articulated to her therapist and in her letter to the Court.

### IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

44. Mother requests that the Court enter a modified order regarding custody and parenting time that is consistent with Sophie’s best interests and reflects Mother’s current ability to provide a stable, nurturing home, including substantially increased overnights with Mother.

45. Specifically, Mother respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2016 Custody Order;  

   b. Determine that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child;  

   c. Order a revised parenting schedule that significantly increases Mother’s parenting time, including regular overnights in Mother’s home, such that Sophie spends substantially more time with Mother each week and on weekends, while maintaining meaningful time with Father;  

   d. Maintain or confirm joint legal custody (to the extent currently ordered), or otherwise fashion an allocation of legal and physical custody that promotes Sophie’s best interests;  

   e. Consider Sophie’s age, maturity, therapeutic needs, and expressed preferences in crafting an appropriate parenting schedule;  

   f. Order such further relief regarding holidays, school vacations, communication, transportation, and decision‑making as the Court deems just and in the best interests of Sophie; and  

   g. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Assume jurisdiction over this matter;

2. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2016 Custody Order dated May 15, 2016;

3. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Johnson;

4. Enter a Modified Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time that:

   a. Substantially increases Mother’s parenting time and overnights with Sophie;  
   b. Provides a regular and predictable schedule which allows Sophie to spend meaningful, substantive time with Mother during the school week and on weekends;  
   c. Maintains Sophie’s important relationship with Father through reasonable and appropriate parenting time with him; and  
   d. Includes such additional provisions concerning holidays, school vacations, transportation, communication, and decision‑making as are necessary to serve Sophie’s best interests;

5. Order that each party comply with all terms of the modified judgment;

6. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA THOMPSON
