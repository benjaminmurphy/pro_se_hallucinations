      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that a lessor who commits any act in violation of that section (including interference \u2018with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises\u2019) shall \u2018be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u2019\u2026 Section 14 allows a minimum recovery of three months\u2019 rent as an incentive to the pursuit of relief where the actual and consequential damages are slight or are difficult to prove. When the actual damages exceed three months\u2019 rent, however, \u00a7 14 plainly states that actual damages should be the measure of recovery.\u201d"
