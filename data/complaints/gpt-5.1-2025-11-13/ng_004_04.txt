    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                   Civil Action No. __________  

ANNA BROOKS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Anna Brooks (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present on the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Anna Brooks is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, manages, and/or controls a three‑unit residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603 (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for maintenance, including snow and ice removal, of the sidewalk and means of ingress and egress serving the tenants and lawful visitors to the Property.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and this is a civil action at law for personal injury.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the cause of action arose in Worcester County and the Property where the incident occurred is located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Defendant is the owner and person in control of the three‑unit residential building and its appurtenant sidewalk located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

7. The sidewalk area at issue is immediately adjacent to and serving the Property and is used regularly by tenants, their guests, invitees, delivery persons, and other foreseeable lawful visitors, including Plaintiff.

8. On or about February 13–14, 2023, a winter snowstorm occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts, depositing snow and creating winter conditions on and around the Property.

9. Following the snowstorm, and prior to February 15, 2023, Defendant undertook to shovel the sidewalk in front of the Property but only created a narrow, central path through the snow.

10. Defendant failed to apply, and did not cause anyone else to apply, salt, sand, or any other ice‑melt or traction material to the shoveled path or surrounding areas.

11. Over the next couple of days after the storm, daytime temperatures caused snow and ice to melt on and around the sidewalk, and nighttime freezing temperatures caused the meltwater to refreeze, a known and foreseeable phenomenon during Massachusetts winters.

12. As a result of this melt‑and‑refreeze cycle, the narrow shoveled path maintained by Defendant turned into a sheet of smooth, dangerously slippery ice extending along the portion of the sidewalk used as the primary walking path.

13. The hazardous icy condition existed for at least one to two days before Plaintiff’s fall, and was open, notorious, and apparent to the Defendant, who resided in, visited, or otherwise regularly attended to the Property.

14. Tenants of the Property observed and were aware of the dangerously icy sidewalk and, before Plaintiff’s fall, communicated their concerns directly to Defendant.

15. Specifically, the tenants texted Defendant, notified her that the sidewalk and walkway had become a sheet of ice, and sent her photographs depicting the hazardous condition of the icy path.

16. In response to these warnings, Defendant stated, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” and declined to take further remedial measures such as applying salt or sand, further shoveling, or otherwise removing or treating the ice.

17. By doing so, Defendant knowingly chose not to address a specific, reported hazard on the Property and consciously relied on natural melting rather than taking reasonable safety measures.

18. On February 15, 2023, at approximately a time during daylight or early evening hours, Plaintiff arrived at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, to deliver groceries to one of the tenants.

19. Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises as a business invitee or lawful visitor, performing a delivery to one of Defendant’s tenants with the tenant’s knowledge and consent, and for the mutual benefit of the tenant and Defendant as landlord.

20. Plaintiff approached the Property by walking along the sidewalk and the narrow path that had been shoveled by Defendant or at Defendant’s direction.

21. The path appeared to be the intended walkway for people approaching or leaving the Property, and Plaintiff used it in the normal, foreseeable manner.

22. As Plaintiff walked along the narrow path in a careful and ordinary manner, she encountered the sheet of ice that had formed on the path because of the prior melting and refreezing.

23. Without warning, Plaintiff’s feet suddenly slipped on the ice, causing her to lose her balance.

24. Plaintiff was thrown violently backward, landing hard on her lower back on the icy, unforgiving surface.

25. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in her lower back and was dazed and shaken by the fall.

26. After the fall, one or more of the tenants came outside or otherwise attended to Plaintiff and informed her that they had previously reported the icy condition to Defendant and had sent Defendant photographs.

27. The tenants further told Plaintiff that Defendant responded that “the sun will take care of it” and did not apply salt, sand, or other treatment to the icy path.

28. As a direct result of this fall, Plaintiff suffered a lower back injury requiring medical evaluation and treatment.

29. Plaintiff presented to medical providers for examination, diagnostic testing, and treatment of her back injury.

30. Plaintiff’s medical treatment included, but was not necessarily limited to, office visits, diagnostic imaging, prescription and/or over‑the‑counter medication, and instructions for rest and activity limitation.

31. Plaintiff’s reasonably incurred medical expenses related to the injury are approximately $2,500, and may increase as treatment continues or future care becomes necessary.

32. As a further direct result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week following the fall.

33. Plaintiff lost approximately $1,000 in wages due to her inability to work during this period of disability and recovery.

34. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities as a result of the back injury sustained in the fall.

35. Plaintiff has experienced, and may continue to experience, physical pain, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and functional limitations due to the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence.

36. Plaintiff did not create, cause, or contribute to the dangerous condition of the sidewalk.

37. At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for her own safety, walked in a normal and prudent fashion, and had no reasonable opportunity to detect or avoid the hidden and deceptively slippery ice condition created or allowed by Defendant.

38. The hazardous condition of the sidewalk—namely, the sheet of ice along the narrow shoveled path—was not open and obvious to Plaintiff in a manner that would have alerted a reasonable person to the extreme risk of serious injury, particularly given that the path had been apparently cleared for safe travel.

39. Defendant, by contrast, had actual knowledge of the ice hazard through tenant reports and photographs, and constructive knowledge due to the length of time the hazard existed and her control and responsibility over the Property.

40. Despite having both actual and constructive notice of the hazardous ice condition, Defendant failed to take any reasonable steps to remediate or warn of the danger, such as applying salt or sand, widening or re‑shoveling the path, chipping away the ice, erecting signs or cones, or temporarily restricting use of the area.

41. Defendant’s acts and omissions were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s fall, injuries, and resulting damages.

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (SINGLE COUNT)

42. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 41 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

43. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or person in control of real property owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to the condition of the property and conduct of third persons, including the duty to maintain the premises in reasonably safe condition and to protect lawful visitors against unreasonable risks of harm. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (abolishing common‑law distinction between invitees and licensees and recognizing general duty of reasonable care).

44. Defendant, as owner and person in control of the Property at 123 Maple Street, owed Plaintiff, a lawful visitor and business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of the sidewalk and means of ingress and egress to the building, including snow and ice removal and treatment.

45. Under Massachusetts law, an owner or person in control of premises has a duty to remedy or warn of known or reasonably knowable hazards, including snow and ice conditions, within a reasonable time after they arise. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378–79 (2010) (abolishing the “natural accumulation” rule and holding that property owners owe a duty to lawful visitors to remedy reasonably foreseeable dangers from accumulations of snow and ice).

46. The duty of reasonable care includes the obligation to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would under similar circumstances, taking into account foreseeable weather conditions, melt and refreeze cycles, frequency of use, and the foreseeability of harm to lawful visitors. *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995) (duty to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable harm).

47. Defendant’s duty extended to maintaining the sidewalk and principal walking paths in a condition that would be reasonably safe for foreseeable users, or to provide adequate warning and alternative safe routes if a particular area could not reasonably be maintained safely. *Humphrey v. Byron*, 447 Mass. 322, 329–30 (2006) (landowner owes duty of reasonable care to persons lawfully on premises); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013).

**Breach**

48. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care in numerous ways, including but not limited to:

   a. Creating or maintaining a narrow shoveled path down the middle of the sidewalk that became the primary walkway for tenants and visitors, while failing to ensure that it remained reasonably safe;

   b. Failing to apply salt, sand, or any other ice‑melt or traction material to the path despite knowledge of freezing conditions;

   c. Failing to further shovel, widen, or re‑clear the path when melting and refreezing made the path dangerously icy;

   d. Ignoring tenants’ warnings and photographs that specifically alerted her to the dangerous sheet of ice on the sidewalk;

   e. Relying on “the sun” to remove the ice instead of taking reasonable, affirmative steps to eliminate or mitigate the hazard;

   f. Failing to inspect the sidewalk and walkway at reasonable intervals in the days following the snowstorm, when she knew or should have known that melt and refreeze cycles were occurring;

   g. Failing to warn tenants, visitors, delivery persons, or other foreseeable users of the icy condition, such as by posting signs, roping off the area, or otherwise communicating the danger; and

   h. Failing to provide or maintain an alternative safe means of ingress and egress while the primary path was hazardous.

49. Massachusetts law requires property owners to act reasonably in responding to winter conditions; they may not simply do nothing or unreasonably delay in treating snow and ice hazards. *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 378–79 (landowners must act as a “reasonable person under all of the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk”).
