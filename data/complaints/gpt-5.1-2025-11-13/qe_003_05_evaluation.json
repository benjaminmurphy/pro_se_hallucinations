However, the facts concern excessive bar noise created by another tenant, not physical defects in the rental unit, and the court\u2019s language is framed in terms of constructive eviction and habitability. So it supports the general principle that inaction after notice, when the landlord can control the condition, can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment, but only by analogy to the specific context presented.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done. ... Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable."
