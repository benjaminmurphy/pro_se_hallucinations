COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
______________________________  

Plaintiff Jessica Monroe (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Harold Wiggins (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Monroe is an individual residing at 275 Washington Avenue, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant Harold Wiggins is, upon information and belief, an individual and the owner and/or manager and landlord of the residential property located at 275 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord of the Premises and responsible for maintaining the common areas, including the main entry door and building security.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 212, § 3 because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court and the claims arise under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. Venue is proper in the Chelsea District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the Premises are located in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Chelsea.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–5 as if fully set forth herein.

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for an apartment located at 275 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts (the “Apartment”), with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has continuously rented the Apartment from Defendant since on or about January 1, 2022, and pays monthly rent of $1,500.

9. The Apartment is part of a multi‑unit residential building whose main common entry door is supposed to remain closed and locked so that only residents and invited guests can enter.

10. The main entry door to the building has a broken lock and does not latch or secure properly, allowing anyone to push the door open and gain access to the building without a key or permission.

11. The unsafe condition of the entry door and lock existed at least as of approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, and upon information and belief, for some time before that.

12. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the broken and unsecured main entry door approximately two months before the date of this Complaint.

13. At that time, Plaintiff specifically informed Defendant that the door lock did not latch properly, that the door could be pushed open by anyone, and that this created a serious safety and security risk.

14. Defendant acknowledged the problem and told Plaintiff that he would have the lock and door repaired.

15. Despite this assurance, Defendant failed to repair or adequately secure the main entry door.

16. After her initial complaint, Plaintiff reminded Defendant at least two additional times that the main entry door lock remained broken and that the door continued to be unsecured.

17. Defendant nevertheless failed and refused to take reasonable steps to repair the entry door or otherwise to secure the building in a timely manner.

18. As a direct and foreseeable result of the broken entry door and lack of building security, last month (approximately November 2025) an unknown person or persons entered the building through the unsecured main entrance.

19. Once inside, the intruder(s) went through tenants’ mail and packages located in the common hallway.

20. During this incident, Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately $120, was stolen from the hallway.

21. Several other tenants also experienced tampering with or theft of their mail and packages, further demonstrating that unauthorized persons had gained access due to the unsecured main entry door.

22. In addition to the mail theft, Plaintiff discovered signs that an unknown person had been sleeping or staying in the building’s basement, including personal items and other evidence of occupancy.

23. The presence of unauthorized individuals in the basement and common areas of the building has caused Plaintiff to feel unsafe and anxious in her home.

24. Due to the continuing failure of Defendant to secure the common entry door and the resulting safety risk, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for her own apartment door, at her own expense.

25. Plaintiff also purchased and installed a better deadbolt lock on her apartment door to help protect herself and her property.

26. Plaintiff’s security camera and upgraded deadbolt lock cost her approximately $200.

27. Plaintiff incurred these costs because Defendant failed to provide a reasonably secure building and refused to promptly repair the main entry door lock after repeated notice.

28. Plaintiff’s sense of safety and peace in the Apartment has been substantially disturbed by:  
    a. The broken main entry door and lack of building security;  
    b. The theft of her package and mail tampering;  
    c. The evidence of someone sleeping in the basement; and  
    d. Defendant’s dismissive response that Plaintiff was “overreacting” and that “the neighborhood is safe,” in the face of clear and ongoing security problems.

29. Defendant has not meaningfully disputed that the entry door lock is broken, but has failed to make necessary repairs, despite multiple complaints and the known security incidents.

30. Plaintiff has been forced to live with the ongoing anxiety that unauthorized persons can and do enter the building at will, that her mail and property may be stolen, and that an intruder may access her apartment or otherwise threaten her safety.

31. Plaintiff has complied with her obligations as a tenant by paying rent and acting reasonably to protect her own safety and property.

32. Defendant’s failure to repair and maintain the common entrance and lock has substantially impaired Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, safety, and use of her home.

33. Plaintiff estimates that, at minimum, she has suffered approximately $320 in out‑of‑pocket monetary damages: $120 for the stolen package and approximately $200 for the security camera and lock upgrades, not including additional non‑economic harm such as fear, stress, and loss of peace of mind.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

34. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–33 as if fully set forth herein.

35. Under Massachusetts law, residential tenants are protected by an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides that a landlord shall not, directly or indirectly, interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the premises by the tenant.

36. G.L. c. 186, § 14 states, in relevant part, that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

37. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 applies regardless of whether it is expressly stated in the written lease, and is deemed a part of all residential tenancies in Massachusetts. See, e.g., *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 293 N.E.2d 831 (1973).

38. Substantial interferences with the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the premises, including chronic or serious conditions affecting safety, security, or habitability, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 629 N.E.2d 301 (1994); *Medeiros v. Hous. Auth. of Fall River*, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 487 N.E.2d 137 (1985).

39. A landlord may be liable for a breach of the covenant when the interference with quiet enjoyment results from the landlord’s failure, after notice, to take reasonable steps to correct conditions in the common areas of the building that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 431 N.E.2d 556 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 358 N.E.2d 817 (1977).

40. The landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 does not require proof of malice or bad faith; it is enough that the landlord, after notice, failed to act reasonably to prevent or correct conditions that foreseeably and substantially interfered with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, supra; *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 430 N.E.2d 869 (1982).

41. Defendant had a duty to maintain the common areas of the building, including the main entry door, in a safe and secure condition consistent with G.L. c. 186, § 14, the implied warranty of habitability, and applicable sanitary and building codes. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, supra; G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.351 (requiring exterior doors to be maintained in good repair and capable of being secured).

42. Plaintiff gave Defendant actual notice that the main entry door lock was broken and that the building was not secure.

43. Defendant had repeated opportunities, over a period of at least two months, to repair the lock and secure the entrance but failed and refused to do so.

44. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that an unsecured main entry door in a multi‑unit residential building in Chelsea posed a serious risk of unauthorized entry, theft, and threat to tenant safety.

45. Defendant’s failure to repair the main entry door and lock, despite repeated notice, was unreasonable and constituted at least negligent, and effectively reckless, disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and safety.

46. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s inaction, unauthorized individuals entered the building through the unsecured door, resulting in the theft of Plaintiff’s package and the apparent presence of intruders in the basement.

47. The ongoing security problems, theft, and presence of unknown persons in the building’s common areas have substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment and her sense of safety in her home.

48. Massachusetts courts have held that interferences that jeopardize a tenant’s safety or that cause ongoing fear, anxiety, or loss of peace of mind can constitute a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, supra (persistent flooding and landlord’s inaction constituted breach); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, supra (landlord liability for failure to address conditions impacting tenant safety); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, supra (landlord responsible for foreseeable interference caused by activities on premises).

49. Defendant’s repeated dismissal of Plaintiff’s concerns as “overreacting,” and his refusal to take reasonable and timely steps to secure the building, further demonstrate an ongoing, indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

50. Defendant’s conduct also violated the public policy embodied in the state sanitary code and housing laws requiring landlords to provide safe, sanitary, and secure housing, which Massachusetts courts consider in assessing breaches of quiet enjoyment. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, supra; *Medeiros v. Hous. Auth. of Fall River*, supra.

51. Because Defendant’s failure to repair the common entrance is a continuing condition affecting Plaintiff’s security and quiet enjoyment, the interference is ongoing and will continue until the door and lock are properly repaired and the building is made reasonably secure.

52. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:  
    a. Actual monetary losses, including the value of the stolen package (approximately $120) and security measures she was forced to purchase (approximately $200);  
    b. Loss of the full benefit of her tenancy, including the right to feel reasonably safe and secure in her home; and  
    c. Emotional distress, fear, anxiety, and loss of peace of mind.

53. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover, at a minimum, her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is presently requesting approximately $320 in direct damages, she reserves the right to seek the full remedies provided by law, including statutory damages.

54. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, as interpreted by *Simon v. Solomon*, *Blackett v. Olanoff*, *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, *Medeiros v. Hous. Auth. of Fall River*, *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, and related authorities.
