____________________________________/

### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Quincy Family Restaurant (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, at all times relevant to this action, was a lawful patron and business invitee of the restaurant operated by Defendant in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Family Restaurant is a business entity organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or another state doing business in Massachusetts), operating a casual dining restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts 02169.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, controlled, managed, maintained, and/or operated the premises located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169 (the “Premises”), including the hallway between the kitchen and dining room where the incident described herein occurred.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The Superior Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

6. Venue is proper in Norfolk County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County, where the Premises are located and where Plaintiff’s injury occurred.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a paying customer and business invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169.

8. At all times relevant, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises for the mutual benefit of herself and Defendant.

9. The Premises include a relatively narrow hallway running between the restaurant’s kitchen area and its dining room, as well as access to restrooms used by patrons.

10. On or about the evening of August 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was seated in the dining area eating dinner, a server employed by Defendant was carrying a tray containing several water glasses through the narrow hallway between the kitchen and dining room.

11. The server dropped the tray, causing multiple glasses to fall and break, and causing water and ice to spill across the tile floor in the hallway.

12. The water and ice created a wet and slippery condition on the tile floor in a primary path of travel between the dining room, kitchen, and restrooms.

13. Defendant’s server removed or gathered the broken glass but left a substantial amount of water and/or melting ice on the floor, creating a hazardous, wet condition.

14. Upon information and belief, the server stated, in substance, that she would “be right back with a mop,” acknowledging both the existence of the hazardous condition and the need to clean it up.

15. Despite that statement, no “Wet Floor,” “Caution,” or other warning signage or barriers were placed in or around the area where the water and ice were left on the floor.

16. Neither the server nor any other employee of Defendant immediately mopped, dried, or otherwise cleaned and rendered safe the area where the spill occurred.

17. For approximately ten or more minutes after the spill, the wet condition remained on the floor in the narrow hallway, without warning, cones, barricades, or other safeguards, even though employees of Defendant knew or should have known of the hazard.

18. During that time, restaurant employees continued to move through the hallway and, upon information and belief, deliberately “dodged” the puddle rather than promptly and reasonably remedying the condition or providing adequate warning.

19. After finishing her meal, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom, which required her to walk through the hallway where the spill had occurred.

20. As Plaintiff walked into the hallway, the tile floor appeared to be shiny. Plaintiff reasonably believed the shine was a normal aspect of the floor tile, not a concealed puddle of water and melted ice.

21. As Plaintiff stepped into the hallway, she unknowingly and unintentionally stepped onto the wet and slippery area that had been left by Defendant’s employee.

22. Plaintiff’s foot slipped on the wet floor, causing her to lose her balance and violently twist and sprain her knee, before catching herself from a more serious fall.

23. Plaintiff immediately felt significant pain in her knee and had difficulty bearing weight, standing, and walking.

24. After the incident, Plaintiff overheard staff members employed by Defendant conversing about the spill and saying, in substance, that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

25. This statement confirms that Defendant’s employees had actual knowledge of the hazardous wet condition on the floor prior to Plaintiff’s injury, and that the condition had existed for a sufficient time that they had repeatedly encountered and avoided it.

26. At no point before the incident did Defendant or its employees warn Plaintiff of the presence of the water and ice on the floor, verbally or through any cones, signage, or barriers.

27. At no point before the incident did Defendant or its employees block access to the wet area, place mats or absorbent material, or adequately and reasonably clean and dry the hallway floor to remove the hazard.

28. Defendant’s failure to timely and reasonably remedy the spill, or to warn Plaintiff and other invitees, created an unreasonably dangerous condition in a foreseeable pedestrian pathway.

29. Following the incident, Plaintiff reported her injury and pain to Defendant’s staff and left the restaurant to seek medical care.

30. Plaintiff presented to urgent care shortly after the incident, where she was examined and diagnosed with a severe sprain of the knee.

31. Plaintiff’s providers recommended and/or prescribed a knee brace, rest, restricted activity, pain management, and a course of physical therapy.

32. Plaintiff underwent weeks of physical therapy to treat her knee sprain, restore strength and range of motion, and reduce pain.

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for urgent care, diagnostic evaluation, follow-up care, bracing, and physical therapy.

34. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability or reduced ability to work during her period of recovery.

35. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, limitation of activities, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of her injuries.

36. Plaintiff’s injuries and losses are permanent or continuing in nature to the extent that she remains at increased risk of future pain, flare‑ups, or functional limitations.

37. At all times relevant, Plaintiff used reasonable care for her own safety and did not act negligently or unreasonably under the circumstances.

38. Any negligence attributed to Plaintiff, which Plaintiff expressly denies, is less than the negligence of Defendant, and Plaintiff’s recovery is therefore not barred under G.L. c. 231, § 85.

39. Defendant, by and through its employees, servants, and/or agents acting within the scope of their employment, owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Premises, including keeping walkways in a reasonably safe condition and providing adequate warnings of known hazards.

40. Defendant breached that duty, directly and proximately causing Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

---

## IV. NEGLIGENCE (PREMISES LIABILITY)

41. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–40 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

### Duty

42. As a business owner and possessor of land open to the public for business purposes, Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect Plaintiff from foreseeable risks of harm. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

43. This duty included, without limitation:

   a. Inspecting and monitoring the Premises, including high‑traffic areas such as the hallway between the kitchen and dining room and the route to the restrooms, to discover unsafe conditions in a timely manner;

   b. Taking reasonable steps to correct, remedy, or remove dangerous conditions such as spills, standing water, and slippery floors;

   c. Providing timely and adequate warnings and safeguards (e.g., warning signs, cones, barricades, verbal warnings, mats) when a dangerous condition exists or is reasonably foreseeable and cannot be immediately remedied; and

   d. Training and supervising employees to respond promptly and reasonably to spills and other hazards.

44. Massachusetts law recognizes that owners and occupiers of land must act as a reasonable person in all the circumstances in the maintenance of their property. See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013) (reaffirming general standard of reasonable care owed by landowners); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 369–70 (2010) (abolishing “natural accumulation” doctrine and applying ordinary negligence principles to property owners).

45. Defendant is vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, including the server and other staff, committed within the scope of their employment. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002) (employer vicariously liable for negligence of employee acting within scope of employment).

### Breach

46. Defendant, by and through its employees, breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to the following negligent acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to promptly and adequately clean, dry, or otherwise remove the water and ice that had spilled onto the tile floor in the hallway;

   b. Failing to cordon off, block access to, or otherwise prevent customers from traversing the area of the spill until it could be made safe;

   c. Failing to place any “Wet Floor,” “Caution,” or similar warning signs or cones in or near the area of the spill;

   d. Failing to verbally warn Plaintiff and other patrons of the hazardous condition, despite actual knowledge of the spill and its persistence over time;

   e. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the prompt response to spills and similar slip hazards;

   f. Failing to properly train employees in the identification and remediation of hazardous floor conditions; and

   g. Continuing to allow staff and patrons to use the hallway, while employees themselves “dodged” the puddle, thus confirming their awareness of the danger yet choosing not to remedy or warn of it.

47. Massachusetts courts recognize that a property owner is liable when it knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of a dangerous condition and failed to remedy or warn of it. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–83 (2007) (storeowner liable where it knew or should have known of dangerous condition and failed to use reasonable care to protect patrons); *Oliveri v. MBTA*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain premises in safe condition).

48. Here, Defendant’s employees had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition, as evidenced by the server’s statement about returning with a mop and the staff’s later statements that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

49. Even if Defendant’s knowledge were characterized as constructive rather than actual, the existence of the spill for at least ten minutes in a high‑traffic area used by both staff and patrons, coupled with employees repeatedly traversing and avoiding the puddle, satisfies the requirement that Defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition through the exercise of reasonable care. See *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961) (constructive notice where condition existed long enough that it should have been discovered and remedied); *Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co.*, 208 Mass. 273, 276–77 (1911) (constructive notice based on condition’s appearance and time on floor).

50. Defendant’s decision to defer cleanup of the spill, to allow the wet condition to persist in the hallway, and to fail to warn invitees such as Plaintiff of the danger was unreasonable and fell below the standard of care required under Massachusetts law.

51. The hazard presented by a wet and slippery tile floor in a restaurant hallway is obvious and well known; it was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that a patron such as Plaintiff could slip and suffer serious injury if the spill were not promptly remediated or warned against. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 784–86 (discussing reasonable foreseeability of tracked‑in liquid hazard in supermarket aisles).

52. Defendant’s breaches of its duty of care constitute negligence under Massachusetts common law. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (negligence elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages).

### Causation

53. Defendant’s negligence, as described above, was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip, fall, and resultant knee injury.

54. But for Defendant’s failure to clean the spill and/or warn of the wet and slippery floor, Plaintiff would not have encountered the hazardous condition and would not have slipped and injured her knee.

55. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (proximate cause satisfied where defendant’s negligence was substantial factor in producing harm).

### Damages

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer the following injuries and damages:

   a. Physical injury in the form of a severe sprain to the knee;

   b. Pain, suffering, and discomfort associated with the injury and its treatment;

   c. Medical expenses in an amount presently estimated at approximately $2,500 for urgent care, diagnostic evaluation, bracing, and physical therapy;

   d. Loss of wages and/or impairment of earning capacity in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,200;

   e. Inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and limitations on Plaintiff’s normal activities and hobbies during the period of recovery;

   f. Emotional distress and anxiety associated with the injury and physical limitations; and

   g. Such additional general, special, and consequential damages as will be proven at trial.

57. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any negligence, if any, on the part of Plaintiff is to be compared with the negligence of Defendant, and Plaintiff’s recovery is diminished only in proportion to her percentage of fault, if any, provided that such negligence is not greater than that of Defendant.

58. Plaintiff’s total damages exceed the jurisdictional minimum of this Court and are reasonably expected to exceed $50,000.

---

   l. *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317 (2002) (respondeat superior liability for employees’ negligence).

60. The foregoing authorities, together with other applicable Massachusetts cases and statutes, provide the legal framework under which Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence and under which Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages.
