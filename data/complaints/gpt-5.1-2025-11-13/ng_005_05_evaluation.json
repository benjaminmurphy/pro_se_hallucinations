Instead, the Payton court narrows recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress by requiring physical harm manifested by objective symptoms and expressly denies recovery for purely emotional distress based on increased statistical risk of future disease. There is no discussion or endorsement of a general right to be made whole in damages under Massachusetts law in the sense stated in the proposition.",

In summary, we hold that a plaintiff in order to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress must prove the following: (1) negligence; (2) emotional distress; (3) causation; (4) physical harm manifested by objective symptomatology; and (5) that a reasonable person would have suffered emotional distress under the circumstances of the case.\""
