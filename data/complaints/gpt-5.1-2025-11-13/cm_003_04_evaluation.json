Nothing in the cited pages (350\u201352) establishes a principle about conditioning or supervising parental contact due to substance-related safety risks.

A judge may properly be guided by evidence demonstrating reason to believe that a parent will correct a condition or weakness that currently disables the parent from serving his or her child\u2019s best interests.\u201d"
