COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson, proceeding pro se, states as follows for her complaint against Defendant Karen Reynolds:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Premises”). Plaintiff may be contacted by the Court at telephone number (617) 555‑0123 and email address: psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Karen Reynolds (“Defendant”) is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and lessor of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

6. Jurisdiction is proper in Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, because the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

7. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 2, because Plaintiff’s tenancy is located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for a residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Premises”), from Defendant, at a monthly rent of $1,200.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid, or been ready, willing, and able to pay, the agreed‑upon rent of $1,200 per month.

10. The Premises include a bathroom with a shower. The bathroom has no window and relies solely on a mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation.

11. In or about 2025, mold began to grow in Plaintiff’s bathroom. The mold first appeared in the corner of the shower and then spread to the bathroom ceiling and other areas.

12. Plaintiff observed dark mold growth on surfaces in the shower area and ceiling, which persisted despite ordinary cleaning.

13. After noticing the mold growth and becoming concerned for her health and safety, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition.

14. Defendant came to the Premises to look at the bathroom and observed the mold condition.

15. Rather than arranging for proper inspection, remediation, and correction of the underlying moisture and ventilation problems, Defendant blamed Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff that the mold growth was due to Plaintiff allegedly not running the exhaust fan enough and taking showers that were “too hot and too long.”

16. Plaintiff does run the exhaust fan when she showers on a regular basis and uses the bathroom in a normal, reasonable manner for a residential tenant.

17. Plaintiff’s use of the bathroom, including taking hot showers, is normal and customary for tenants and does not constitute negligent or improper use of the Premises.

18. The bathroom has no window and depends on the exhaust fan and the landlord‑provided building systems for adequate ventilation and moisture control.

19. Following the appearance of the mold, Plaintiff began to experience respiratory symptoms she had not experienced before living with the mold condition, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing.

20. Plaintiff sought medical attention, and her doctor advised her that the respiratory issues were likely related to, or exacerbated by, the mold exposure in her bathroom.

21. Plaintiff’s doctor informed her that she should have the mold properly remediated to protect her health.

22. Plaintiff communicated the seriousness of the mold issue and the health concerns to Defendant and requested that Defendant remediate the mold and address the underlying cause, including inadequate ventilation.

23. Defendant has stated that she would only clean the existing mold but would not take steps to address or improve the ventilation or otherwise correct the underlying conditions that are causing recurring mold growth.

24. Defendant has refused to accept responsibility for the condition and has insisted that Plaintiff “caused” the mold problem.

25. Plaintiff has been forced to live with a persistent mold condition in the bathroom, which has interfered with her ability to safely and comfortably use the bathroom for ordinary purposes such as showering and personal hygiene.

26. As a direct result of the mold contamination, Plaintiff was required to discard certain personal property that became moldy and could not be safely used, including a shower curtain and towels with a total value of approximately $60.

27. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, physical discomfort, respiratory problems, inconvenience, anxiety, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises due to the persistent mold and Defendant’s failure to properly remediate and correct the underlying condition.

28. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $200 in damages due to the interference with her quiet enjoyment, including health‑related harm, loss of personal property, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.

29. At all times relevant, Plaintiff used the Premises in a lawful, normal, and reasonable manner for residential purposes and did not cause or contribute to any defect in the Premises’ construction, ventilation, or plumbing.

30. The presence of mold and persistent dampness and inadequate ventilation in a bathroom constitutes a condition that materially impairs the health, safety, and well‑being of occupants.

31. Under the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., a landlord must maintain rented premises in a habitable condition, free from conditions that may endanger or materially impair the health or safety of the occupants.

32. Defendant, after receiving notice of the mold and its effect on Plaintiff’s health, failed to timely and adequately remedy the condition or correct the underlying ventilation problems, and instead attributed blame to Plaintiff.

33. Defendant’s conduct and omissions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy by exposing her to unhealthy conditions and significantly impairing her comfort, safety, and use of an essential part of the Premises (the bathroom).

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  

**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

34. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth herein.

35. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.

36. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, where such failure substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises or threatens the tenant’s health or safety, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  

   a. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for quiet enjoyment breach when acts or omissions create or allow substantial interference with tenant’s use);  
   
   b. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (repeated failure to correct serious defects affecting health and safety constituted a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and warranted multiple damages);  
   
   c. **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (quiet enjoyment violated where landlord’s conduct substantially impaired tenant’s enjoyment, including health‑related impacts);  
   
   d. **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (unsanitary and defective conditions can amount to breach of quiet enjoyment);  
   
   e. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment encompasses freedom from conditions that substantially interfere with tenancy).

37. Defendant had actual notice of the mold condition and of the effect on Plaintiff’s health and safety, through Plaintiff’s reports and Defendant’s own inspection.

38. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to: (a) properly investigate the cause of the mold; (b) engage qualified remediation; (c) correct the underlying defects in ventilation or moisture control; or (d) ensure that the bathroom was safe and sanitary.

39. Defendant’s refusal to address anything beyond superficial “cleaning” of visible mold, while denying responsibility for the underlying defective conditions, constitutes a willful and/or knowing failure to correct conditions that pose a risk to the health and safety of Plaintiff and that significantly impair Plaintiff’s use of the Premises.

40. Exposure to mold and damp, unsanitary conditions that adversely affect respiratory health materially impairs the character and value of the tenancy, and constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord’s failure to correct serious code violations affecting habitability and safety is a breach of quiet enjoyment); **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas**, 417 Mass. 782 (1994) (breach found where conditions posed threats to health and safety).

41. The presence of mold and Defendant’s refusal to adequately remedy it also amount to a violation of the State Sanitary Code, which in turn supports a claim of breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (habitability and sanitary code compliance are fundamental to residential tenancies); 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

42. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s persistent failure, after notice, to remedy sanitary code violations or conditions threatening a tenant’s health and safety constitutes an “act or omission” that directly or indirectly interrupts or interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005); **Figueroa v. Ponce**, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 1121 (2016) (Rule 1:28 decision) (reaffirming liability where landlords ignore serious conditions).

43. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above constitute an unlawful interference, by act and/or omission, with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:  

   a. Physical discomfort, respiratory issues, and related health impacts;  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of the bathroom and impairment of the overall value and comfort of the tenancy;  
   c. Loss and damage to personal property (including a shower curtain and towels valued at approximately $60); and  
   d. Inconvenience, distress, and disruption of ordinary daily living caused by the unsafe and unsanitary conditions.

45. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord who breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment “shall also be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

46. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200. Three months’ rent is therefore $3,600.

47. Even though Plaintiff’s out‑of‑pocket losses and the damages she presently claims are approximately $200, G.L. c. 186, § 14 entitles her, upon proof of a breach, to a minimum recovery of three months’ rent ($3,600) or her actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any).

48. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, together with costs and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Karen Reynolds, and award the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by failing to properly remediate and correct the mold and underlying conditions in Plaintiff’s bathroom and by thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than three (3) months’ rent, i.e., $3,600, or Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, together with interest as allowed by law under G.L. c. 231, § 6B and/or § 6C;
