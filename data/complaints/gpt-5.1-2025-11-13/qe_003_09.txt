DAVID THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff, Laura Simmons (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant David Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), alleges as follows:

--------------------------------  
I. PARTIES  
--------------------------------  

1. Plaintiff, Laura Simmons, is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is a residential tenant of the premises located at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant, David Thompson, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

3. At all times relevant, Defendant has been the person entitled to rent and responsible for maintenance and repair obligations for the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

--------------------------------  
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
--------------------------------  

4. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14, regarding the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5. The amount of damages Plaintiff seeks, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, is approximately $900, placing this matter within the jurisdiction of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Boston (Jamaica Plain neighborhood), Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the cause of action arose in this county. See G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3, 20.

--------------------------------  
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
--------------------------------  

7. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a studio apartment at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has paid, and continues to pay, monthly rent of $1,500 to Defendant for the Premises.

9. The tenancy is a residential tenancy governed by Massachusetts landlord–tenant law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

10. During the pre‑rental showing of the Premises, Plaintiff observed visible water stains on the ceiling of the apartment.

11. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about those water stains, inquiring whether there had been a leak.

12. Defendant affirmatively represented to Plaintiff that the stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed,” thereby assuring Plaintiff that the ceiling was no longer subject to water intrusion.

13. Relying on Defendant’s representation that the leak had been fully repaired, Plaintiff agreed to rent the Premises and entered into the tenancy beginning February 1, 2022.

14. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, the first significant rainstorm occurred while Plaintiff resided at the Premises.

15. During that rainstorm, water began leaking through the ceiling at or near the exact area where Plaintiff had previously observed the water stains.

16. The water intrusion was not merely cosmetic; water actively dripped from the ceiling into the living area of the studio, forming puddles and soaking nearby furniture and belongings.

17. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the active leak and water intrusion, describing the water dripping from the ceiling during rainstorms.

18. Defendant responded by characterizing the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and refused to take reasonable steps to investigate or remedy the leak.

19. Over time, and through subsequent rainstorms, the leak has persisted and worsened.

20. During at least one storm, the leaking water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined a laptop that Plaintiff had left on the coffee table.

21. Plaintiff’s laptop was rendered unusable and had to be replaced at a cost of approximately $900.

22. Defendant was notified that Plaintiff’s property had been damaged by the continuing leak and that the problem was not minor or cosmetic.

23. Defendant continued to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaints, again stating that the apartment had “character” and minimizing the severity of the water intrusion.

24. Despite multiple complaints and requests for repair, Defendant failed and refused to make timely and adequate repairs to stop the leak or to remediate the resulting moisture damage.

25. As the leak continued, the Premises developed a persistent musty odor indicative of dampness and potential mold or mildew growth.

26. Plaintiff began experiencing recurring headaches that Plaintiff reasonably believes are related to exposure to damp conditions and possible mold at the Premises.

27. Because of the location of the leak and the damp, musty area, Plaintiff was forced to move her bed away from that portion of the apartment to avoid water intrusion and the associated odor.

28. As a result, Plaintiff is effectively confined to using only a portion of the already small studio and has been deprived of the full, reasonable, and safe use of the Premises for ordinary residential living.

29. The ongoing water intrusion, musty odor, and potential mold conditions constitute substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and use and enjoyment of the Premises.

30. Defendant has had actual notice of the recurring leak and the resulting conditions since shortly after Plaintiff moved in, yet has failed to take reasonable and necessary steps to cure the problem.

31. Defendant’s failure to address these conditions is not a mere oversight; it is a continuing, intentional, and unreasonable failure to act in the face of repeated, specific notice from Plaintiff that her use and enjoyment of the Premises is materially impaired.

32. The leak, moisture, and associated conditions materially impair the health, safety, and well‑being of Plaintiff and render the Premises not in compliance with the requirements of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500 (structural elements and weather‑tightness) and 410.750 (conditions deemed to endanger health or safety).

33. The presence of an active roof or ceiling leak and damp, musty conditions is a serious defect that Massachusetts courts have recognized as substantially interfering with tenant habitability and use. See, e.g., Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

34. Throughout the tenancy, Plaintiff has complied with her material obligations under the tenancy, including timely payment of rent, and has not caused the leak or other conditions complained of.

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered:  
    a. Property damage, including the destruction of her laptop worth approximately $900 and damage to furniture;  
    b. Discomfort, inconvenience, and loss of use of significant portions of her small studio apartment; and  
    c. Physical symptoms including headaches and distress reasonably associated with damp and potentially moldy conditions in her home.

36. Defendant’s conduct, in knowingly allowing defective and unsafe conditions to persist after repeated notice, constitutes an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

--------------------------------  
IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
--------------------------------  

37. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is prohibited from “directly or indirectly interfering with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

39. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to the use and enjoyment of the leased premises without substantial interference from the landlord. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982).

40. A landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 may arise where the landlord, after receiving notice, fails to remedy defective conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997).

41. Defendant had actual notice of the leak and resulting conditions in the Premises shortly after Plaintiff commenced her tenancy in February 2022, and on multiple subsequent occasions.

42. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to correct the defective conditions, stop the water intrusion, or remediate the resulting dampness and musty odor.

43. Defendant’s repeated refusal to repair, coupled with his characterization of the conditions as merely “cosmetic” or “character,” reflects an intentional or, at minimum, a reckless and indifferent failure to act in the face of known, serious defects.

44. Defendant’s inaction allowed substantial water intrusion, damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, persistent damp and musty conditions, and potential mold, all of which materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

45. The existence of an ongoing leak, water damage, and unsanitary conditions that impair health or safety violates the State Sanitary Code and undermines the implied warranty of habitability recognized in Massachusetts law. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–02 (1979); Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L.

46. While Plaintiff does not bring a separate claim for breach of the warranty of habitability, the same underlying conditions and statutory standards are relevant to determining whether Defendant’s conduct substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284–85.

47. The covenant of quiet enjoyment may be breached by a landlord’s failure to timely repair known defective conditions that are within the landlord’s control and that substantially impair the value or habitability of the premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–06; Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–49 (2005).

48. Defendant’s failure to fix the leak and to cure the related unsanitary and unhealthy conditions was within Defendant’s exclusive control and responsibility as landlord and property owner.

49. Defendant’s conduct, including his initial misrepresentation that the leak had been “totally fixed” and his subsequent refusal to undertake necessary repairs, constitutes at least a reckless or willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and safety.

50. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff suffered damages, including but not limited to property loss, inconvenience, loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Premises, and physical discomfort and distress.

51. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is self‑represented, she is entitled to statutory damages in at least the amount prescribed by the statute.

52. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500; three months’ rent would therefore be $4,500. Plaintiff’s actual out‑of‑pocket property damage alone is approximately $900, and she has additional consequential damages in the form of loss of use and enjoyment.

53. Plaintiff seeks damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than the statutory minimum (three months’ rent) or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater.

54. In assessing damages for breach of quiet enjoyment, Massachusetts courts consider emotional distress and loss of use as compensable harms. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 105–06; Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979).

55. Defendant’s prolonged failure to repair the leak, despite repeated notice and the clear impact on Plaintiff’s living conditions, constitutes an actionable breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related case law. See Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–52; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

--------------------------------
