The court vacates the open-ended removal provision and remands for a new evidentiary hearing because several years have passed and a contemporaneous record is needed, emphasizing that a child\u2019s best interests and the stability of the status quo must be reassessed over time. This aligns in substance with the idea that an arrangement that was once in the child\u2019s best interests may require modification when circumstances change, though the case is not framed as a modification proceeding per se.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn light of the fact that more than three years have passed since the judgment was entered and the mother and the child relocated to Illinois, we conclude that a further evidentiary hearing is required to enable a judge to make a decision whether the mother\u2019s request for removal to a specific State is warranted on the basis of a contemporaneous record. In determining the best interests of the child, weight, of course, should be given to the fact that \u2018[stability is itself of enormous benefit to a child, and any unnecessary tampering with the status quo simply increases the risk of harm to the child.\u2019 \u201d"
