JENNIFER SMITH,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL SMITH,  
 Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child Emma Smith (date of birth omitted for privacy; age 10).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child Emma Smith.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child Emma Smith (“the Child”), who is the subject of this Complaint for Modification.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, 29, and 31, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this is a proceeding to modify an existing custody and parenting time judgment concerning a minor child of the parties.

5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 6 and applicable provisions of G.L. c. 215, because the prior judgment was entered in this Court, the parties and child reside within the Commonwealth, and the Middlesex Division has continuing jurisdiction over this family.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about May 15, 2017, this Court entered a Judgment (or temporary/permanent order) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the parties’ minor child (the “2017 Judgment”).

7. Under the 2017 Judgment, primary physical residence of the Child was awarded to the Defendant Father, with the Plaintiff Mother receiving limited parenting time consisting of:
   a. Alternate weekend parenting time from Friday after school to Sunday at 5:00 p.m.; and  
   b. One weeknight dinner visit each week, without an overnight, at times specified in the 2017 Judgment or subsequent orders.

8. The 2017 Judgment and parenting schedule were based substantially on the circumstances existing at that time, including, among other things:
   a. Mother’s status as a graduate student;  
   b. Mother’s residence in a small studio apartment not well‑suited to extended overnight parenting time; and  
   c. Mother’s limited and inflexible schedule due to school and related commitments.

9. The 2017 Judgment remains in effect and has not been superseded or vacated, except as may be modified by this Court pursuant to this Complaint for Modification.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2017 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the Child, such that modification of the parenting schedule is necessary and in the Child’s best interests.

11. Mother has completed her graduate education since the 2017 Judgment and now has a stable, full‑time job with regular, predictable hours that allow her to be consistently available to care for the Child during evenings and weekends.

12. Mother now resides in a two‑bedroom apartment in which the Child has her own dedicated bedroom, bed, and personal space, providing a safe, appropriate, and stable environment for regular and extended overnight parenting time.

13. Mother’s living and employment circumstances are materially different from those at the time of the 2017 Judgment; the original limitations on her parenting time were largely premised on her then‑existing graduate school schedule, small studio apartment, and lack of flexibility.

14. Over the years since the 2017 Judgment, Mother and the Child have developed and maintained a close, loving, and healthy parent‑child relationship. The Child is now older (10 years old), more mature, and better able to express her own needs and preferences regarding her relationship with each parent.

15. The Child is engaged in therapy with a licensed mental health professional. Mother is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that the Child has expressed to her therapist feelings of sadness and guilt about having to leave Mother after short visits and that the Child desires to spend more time, including additional overnights, with Mother.

16. Mother is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that the Child’s therapist has indicated that expanding the Child’s time with Mother, including additional overnights, would be beneficial to the Child’s emotional well‑being and would help alleviate the Child’s feelings of guilt and distress when visits end.

17. The Child has written a letter to the Court (or to the Judge of this Court) stating her wish to have more time and more overnights with Mother. While the Child’s expressed preference is not dispositive, it is an important factor the Court may consider in determining her best interests, particularly at her current age and developmental stage. See, e.g., Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266–67 (2001); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–39 (1996).

18. The Child’s stated desire for more time with Mother, her emotional distress when visits end, her increased age and maturity, and the recommendations relayed from her therapist collectively constitute significant post‑judgment developments directly affecting her welfare.

19. Despite these changes and the Child’s clearly expressed desire for more time with Mother, Father has refused to discuss any modification to the existing schedule and becomes angry when the Child attempts to raise the issue of spending more time at Mother’s home.

20. Father’s categorical refusal even to consider a more balanced schedule or to engage in good‑faith discussions about the Child’s needs and preferences contributes to the Child’s feelings of guilt, stress, and emotional conflict.

21. The current parenting plan, designed around Mother’s prior limitations and the Child’s younger age, no longer reflects the present realities of the parents’ circumstances or the Child’s developmental needs and emotional well‑being.

22. The combination of Mother’s substantially improved stability and availability, her appropriate housing with a dedicated bedroom for the Child, the Child’s maturation and clearly expressed wishes, and the Child’s emotional reaction to the current schedule, together with Father’s refusal to adjust the schedule, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the 2017 Judgment under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, in making orders about custody and parenting time, “the rights of the parents shall, in the absence of misconduct, be held to be equal” and “the happiness and welfare of the children shall determine their custody.” The controlling consideration is always the best interests of the child. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); Care & Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704, 711 (1984).

24. In determining whether to modify custody or parenting time, the Court must find both (a) a material change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (b) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; see also Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 546–47 (2010); Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871–72 (2006).

25. Mother’s current circumstances—completion of her education, full‑time stable employment with regular hours, and secure housing with a separate bedroom for the Child—demonstrate that she is fully able to meet the Child’s physical, emotional, educational, and developmental needs during significantly increased and regular overnight periods.

26. Regular and meaningful parenting time with both parents generally promotes a child’s best interests, stability, and emotional development, absent countervailing factors such as abuse or neglect. See, e.g., Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920 (2005); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

27. There is no allegation in this Complaint that either parent has engaged in conduct that would endanger the Child’s physical or emotional health, and Mother is not seeking to terminate or severely restrict Father’s relationship with the Child. Rather, Mother seeks a modification that better reflects the equal rights of both fit parents and the Child’s need for a strong, consistent relationship with each of them. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–44.

28. The Child’s therapist’s reported view that expanded time with Mother, including overnights, would alleviate the Child’s distress and guilt surrounding departures underscores that the requested modification would promote the Child’s emotional welfare. See Jones v. Jones, 349 Mass. 259, 263 (1965) (recognizing the relevance of expert opinion to the child’s best interests).

29. The Child is now ten years old. While not determinative, her age and ability to form and articulate reasonable preferences is an appropriate factor for the Court to consider. Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that the child’s preference, in light of age and maturity, may be weighed as part of the best‑interests analysis. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–39; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 266–67.

30. The current parenting schedule significantly limits the Child’s time with Mother to alternate weekends and a single weeknight dinner, without overnights during the school week. In light of Mother’s now‑stable circumstances and the Child’s clearly expressed desire to increase time with Mother, this schedule is unnecessarily restrictive and no longer serves the Child’s best interests.

31. A more balanced parenting plan that increases the Child’s overnights with Mother, while maintaining substantial contact with Father and minimizing disruption to the Child’s schooling and routine, will:
   a. Strengthen the Child’s secure attachment to both parents;  
   b. Reduce the Child’s feelings of guilt and sadness upon leaving Mother;  
   c. Promote the Child’s emotional stability and well‑being; and  
   d. Reflect the Child’s age‑appropriate preferences and developmental needs.

32. The modification sought by Mother does not seek to undermine Father’s role or alienate the Child from Father. Mother seeks only that the schedule be updated to reflect the current realities of the family, as the law contemplates when there has been a material change in circumstances. See Cooper v. Keto, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 803–04 (2013) (modification appropriate when circumstances materially change and child’s best interests warrant adjustment).

33. Under the totality of the circumstances, including the factors described above and the statutory standard under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, it is in the Child’s best interests that the 2017 Judgment be modified to provide for increased and regular overnight parenting time with Mother and a more balanced residential schedule.

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

34. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.”

35. Massachusetts courts have consistently applied this two‑prong standard in custody and parenting time modification proceedings: (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment; and (2) a modification that is necessary in the child’s best interests. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 546–47; Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 871–72; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 899–900.

36. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and subsequent decisions emphasize the Court’s broad equitable powers to revisit custody and parenting arrangements when post‑judgment events materially affect the welfare of the child and a change is in the child’s best interests.

37. The change in Mother’s circumstances (completion of education, secure and appropriate housing with a bedroom for the Child, stable employment with regular hours), together with the Child’s age‑related developmental changes and her emotional reaction to the current schedule, collectively satisfy the requirement of a material and substantial change in circumstances.

38. It is “necessary in the best interests of the child” under G.L. c. 208, § 28 to modify the 2017 Judgment to increase the Child’s quality time and overnight contact with Mother, in order to support the Child’s emotional health, strengthen her relationship with Mother, and respond appropriately to the Child’s present needs and preferences.

39. The requested modification is also consistent with the policies expressed in G.L. c. 208, § 31, that parental rights are to be held equal in the absence of misconduct, and that the Court’s primary focus must be the happiness and welfare of the child.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

40. Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2017 Judgment to provide for a parenting plan that includes substantially increased and regular overnight parenting time with Mother, while preserving the Child’s relationship with Father and minimizing disruption to the Child’s school and activities.

41. Without limiting the Court’s discretion, Mother requests that the Court enter an order that includes, inter alia, the following terms or substantially similar terms:

   a. That the parties shall continue to share legal custody of the Child (unless the existing order provides otherwise and the Court deems a change appropriate);  

   b. That physical residence shall be modified to allow for a significantly expanded parenting schedule with Mother, such as:  
      i. At minimum, alternate weekends from Friday after school through Monday morning school drop‑off (or the functional equivalent), and  
      ii. At least one, and preferably two, weeknight overnights with Mother on school weeks, with Mother responsible for timely school drop‑off the following morning; or  
      iii. Such other balanced schedule as the Court finds to be in the Child’s best interests given her age, school schedule, and the parents’ work schedules;  

   c. That holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time be adjusted, as needed, to ensure that the Child has meaningful and substantial time with both parents in a manner consistent with her best interests;  

   d. That the parties be ordered to exchange all necessary information regarding the Child’s schooling, medical care, and therapy, and to foster a cooperative co‑parenting relationship consistent with the Child’s best interests; and  

   e. That such additional or alternative provisions regarding transportation, communication, decision‑making, and dispute resolution be entered as the Court deems appropriate and in the Child’s best interests.

42. Mother further requests that the modified order explicitly recognize that both parents are fit and loving parents, and that the expansion of Mother’s parenting time is based on the material change in circumstances and the evolving best interests of the Child, rather than on any finding of unfitness as to either parent.

### VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2017 Judgment concerning custody and parenting time of the minor child Emma Smith;

B. Find and rule that modification of the existing custody and parenting time provisions is necessary and appropriate in order to serve the Child’s best interests pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31 and the applicable case law, including but not limited to Custody of Kali, Custody of Vaughn, Smith v. McDonald, Pizzino v. Miller, Bouchard v. Bouchard, Cooper v. Keto, Rosenthal v. Maney, and Ardizoni v. Raymond;

C. Enter a Judgment of Modification that increases and regularizes the Plaintiff Mother’s overnight parenting time with the Child, including expanded weekend and school‑week overnights, in a pattern and schedule that this Court deems to be in the Child’s best interests;

D. Order such further and additional provisions regarding holidays, vacations, summer schedules, transportation, communication, and co‑parenting responsibilities as the Court determines will promote the Child’s happiness, welfare, and stability;

E. Maintain or adjust legal custody, as appropriate, consistent with the Child’s best interests and the evidence presented;

F. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
