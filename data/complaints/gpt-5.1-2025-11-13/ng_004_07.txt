Civil Action No. _________  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
(Jury Trial Demanded)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Jessica Morales (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Morales”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Tracy Hargrove (“Defendant” or “Ms. Hargrove”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Morales is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Tracy Hargrove is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at all relevant times was the owner, controller, and/or person responsible for the maintenance of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned and/or controlled a three‑unit residential apartment building at the Premises and was responsible for the maintenance of the adjacent sidewalk and appurtenant walkways used by tenants, invitees, and members of the public.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the cause of action arose in Worcester County and the Premises where Plaintiff was injured is located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because she resides in Massachusetts and/or regularly conducts activities and owns real property in Massachusetts, and the claims asserted arise from such activities and ownership. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, controlled, and/or was responsible for the maintenance and condition of the three‑unit apartment building and abutting sidewalk at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

8. Defendant rented residential units at the Premises to tenants who, in the ordinary course of their tenancy, used the front sidewalk and walkway to enter and exit the building.

9. Members of the public, including couriers, delivery persons, and guests of the tenants, also used the sidewalk and walkway in the ordinary course of accessing the Premises.

10. On or about February 13–14, 2023, a winter storm brought snow and freezing temperatures to Worcester, Massachusetts.

11. In the aftermath of that storm, Defendant undertook to remove snow from the sidewalk and/or walkway in front of 123 Maple Street.

12. Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk and failed to apply salt, sand, or any other traction or de‑icing material to treat the walkway.

13. Over the next couple of days, due to natural melting during the daytime and refreezing at night, the narrow shoveled path became an extended, slick sheet of ice.

14. The sheet of ice was located on the primary pedestrian route used by tenants and their invitees to access the building.

15. The icy condition was open and obvious to Defendant and existed for at least several days prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

16. Tenants at the Premises observed the hazardous, icy condition of the shoveled path and recognized it as dangerously slippery.

17. Prior to Plaintiff’s fall, one or more tenants texted Defendant photographs of the icy condition and complained to Defendant about the dangerous state of the walkway.

18. In response to tenants’ complaints and photographs, Defendant dismissed their concerns and stated, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” indicating that she did not intend to apply salt or sand or otherwise reasonably address the hazard.

19. By virtue of these communications, Defendant had actual notice of the hazardous icy condition on the shoveled path.

20. In the alternative, and/or in addition, because the icy condition existed for an extended period following a known storm, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazard. A reasonably prudent property owner in the same or similar circumstances, exercising ordinary care, would have discovered and remediated the ice.

21. On February 15, 2023, at approximately ______ a.m./p.m., Plaintiff was lawfully present on the Premises to deliver groceries to one of Defendant’s tenants at 123 Maple Street.

22. Plaintiff was a business invitee, or at minimum a lawful visitor, using the sidewalk and walkway in the normal and intended manner to access the Premises.

23. As Plaintiff walked along the shoveled path on the sidewalk leading to the entrance of the building, her foot encountered the sheet of ice created and left untreated by Defendant.

24. Because of the dangerously slippery condition of the walkway, Plaintiff’s feet suddenly slipped out from under her and she fell violently backwards.

25. Plaintiff landed hard on her lower back on the icy and unforgiving surface.

26. Plaintiff experienced immediate, significant pain in her lower back following the fall.

27. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries occurred directly on the shoveled but untreated icy path that Defendant created and allowed to remain without reasonable treatment or warning.

28. At no time prior to Plaintiff’s fall did Defendant place adequate warnings, cones, signs, barricades, or other devices to alert lawful visitors to the hazardous condition of the walkway.

29. At no time prior to Plaintiff’s fall did Defendant close off the hazardous area or provide a reasonably safe alternative route for lawful visitors to access the building.

30. At no time prior to Plaintiff’s fall did Defendant apply salt, sand, or other materials in a reasonable manner to mitigate or eliminate the dangerous icy condition.

31. At no time prior to Plaintiff’s fall did Defendant use due care to inspect, maintain, or remedy the unsafe condition of the sidewalk and walkway.

32. Plaintiff was using due care for her own safety at the time of the incident. She walked at a normal pace, looked where she was going, and took the route reasonably expected for visitors to the Premises.

33. Plaintiff did not know, nor reasonably could she have known, that the shoveled path—created and ostensibly maintained for safe passage—was in fact a sheet of ice presenting an unreasonable risk of harm.

34. As a direct and proximate result of the dangerous condition created and/or allowed to persist by Defendant, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including but not limited to a lower back injury.

35. Following the fall, Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for her lower back injury.

36. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for treatment of her injuries, including, but not limited to, office visits, diagnostic testing, and therapy and/or medication.

37. As a further direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week and lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,000.

38. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in her activities of daily living as a result of the injury to her lower back.

39. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience emotional distress, including anxiety and concern about walking on icy or uneven surfaces, resulting from the traumatic fall.

40. Plaintiff’s injuries, economic losses, and non‑economic damages were caused by Defendant’s negligence in the ownership, operation, maintenance, and control of the Premises and the abutting sidewalk and walkway.

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (Sole Cause of Action)

41. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

42. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful visitor and business invitee on the Premises, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including the abutting sidewalk and walkway used by tenants and invitees, in a reasonably safe condition and to protect Plaintiff against unreasonable risks of harm of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (abolishing common‑law distinctions between invitees and licensees and imposing a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995) (landowner owes duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

43. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would under the circumstances in removing or treating snow and ice on the Premises and in not creating or exacerbating dangerous conditions through her snow removal efforts. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378–83 (2010) (property owners owe duty of reasonable care as to all accumulations of snow and ice and may be liable for failure to act reasonably in response to hazards from snow and ice); *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 435 Mass. 353, 357–58 (2001) (duty to exercise reasonable care in snow and ice removal).

44. Pursuant to the general negligence standard recognized in Massachusetts, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty “to conform to a certain standard of conduct for the protection of others against unreasonable risks.” *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 281).

45. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty, once she voluntarily undertook snow removal on the walkway, to perform that undertaking with reasonable care, and not to leave the walkway in a more dangerous condition than if she had done nothing. See *Cottam v. CVS Pharmacy*, 436 Mass. 316, 323–25 (2002) (recognizing liability where a party voluntarily undertakes a duty and performs it negligently); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 323 (negligent performance of an undertaking to render services necessary for the protection of another).

#### Breach

46. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:

   a. Failing to reasonably inspect the sidewalk and walkway at 123 Maple Street for dangerous snow and ice conditions following the February 2023 storm;

   b. Shoveling a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk without applying salt, sand, or other traction or de‑icing materials, thereby creating and/or maintaining a concentrated sheet of ice that posed an unreasonable risk of harm to lawful visitors;

   c. Failing to apply salt, sand, or other de‑icing agents to the shoveled path within a reasonable time after the storm, despite knowing or having reason to know that melt‑and‑refreeze cycles would create ice;

   d. Ignoring or disregarding actual notice from tenants, including text messages and photographs, warning of the dangerously icy condition of the walkway and requesting remedial action;

   e. Failing to take reasonable steps to remediate the hazard once placed on notice, including but not limited to further shoveling, scraping, salting, sanding, barricading, or otherwise treating the ice;

   f. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other lawful visitors about the hazardous icy condition;

   g. Failing to close off the dangerous walkway or provide a reasonably safe alternative route for ingress and egress;

   h. Relying unreasonably on the “sun” to eliminate the dangerous condition rather than taking prompt, active steps to mitigate or remove the ice; and

   i. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

47. Defendant’s conduct in creating and/or allowing a known sheet of ice to persist on the primary walkway used by tenants and visitors constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law. See *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 383–84 (liability for failure to act reasonably with respect to snow and ice); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–56 (2013) (landowner liable where actions create or enhance an obvious risk).

48. Defendant’s failure to respond reasonably to repeated tenant complaints and photographic evidence of the hazardous condition further demonstrates a breach of her duty to exercise reasonable care. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (liability where defendant had actual or constructive notice of dangerous condition and failed to remedy within a reasonable time); *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955) (duty to remedy known hazard on premises).

#### Causation

49. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and injuries.

50. But for Defendant’s failure to reasonably treat and maintain the shoveled path, Plaintiff would not have encountered the sheet of ice that caused her to slip and fall.

51. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that leaving a narrow, untreated shoveled path to melt and refreeze into a sheet of ice on a heavily used walkway would result in slips, falls, and personal injuries to lawful visitors such as Plaintiff. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996) (foreseeability of harm central to negligence analysis).

52. Plaintiff’s injuries are within the class of harms that the duty of reasonable care for snow and ice removal is intended to prevent, and occurred in a manner that was a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s negligence.

#### Damages

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a lower back injury requiring medical evaluation and treatment.

54. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,500 for reasonable and necessary medical care related to her injuries.

55. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff missed approximately one week of work and suffered lost wages of approximately $1,000.

56. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities attributable to the injury to her lower back.

57. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience emotional distress, including anxiety, inconvenience, and a loss of enjoyment of life caused by the injuries and their consequences. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 544–45 (1982) (recognizing recovery for emotional distress accompanying physical injury).

58. Plaintiff has incurred, and may in the future incur, additional medical expenses, lost earning capacity, and other special damages as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

59. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all past and future economic and non‑economic damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence framework); *Shantigar Found. v. Bear Mountain Builders*, 441 Mass. 131, 136–37 (2004) (elements of negligence and damages).

60. To the extent, if any, that Plaintiff is found to have been comparatively negligent, her recovery should be diminished only in proportion to any negligence attributable to her, and she is barred from recovery only if her negligence is greater than the total negligence attributable to the Defendant. See G.L. c. 231, § 85.

### V. COMPLIANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS SNOW AND ICE LAW

61. Under *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), Massachusetts no longer distinguishes between “natural” and “unnatural” accumulations of snow and ice; instead, property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors with respect to all snow and ice conditions on their property.

62. Defendant’s liability in this matter is governed by the general negligence standard articulated in *Papadopoulos* and its progeny, which require property owners to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances in addressing hazards from snow and ice. Id. at 378–83.

63. Defendant’s conduct in shoveling a narrow path and failing to take further reasonable steps—such as salting or sanding—to address the known risk of ice formation violates this standard and constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law.

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

64. Pursuant to Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Morales respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Tracy Hargrove and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be within the jurisdiction of this Court, for all injuries and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to:

   1. Past and future medical expenses, including approximately $1,500 incurred to date;

   2. Past and future lost wages and lost earning capacity, including approximately $1,000 in lost wages incurred to date;

   3. Past and future pain and suffering, physical impairment, and loss of enjoyment of life; and

   4. Emotional distress and related non‑economic damages arising from the injuries and their consequences;

B. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law, including G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C. Costs of this action as allowed by law;

D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
