    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               

JAMES THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child at issue in this Complaint.

2. The Defendant, James Thompson (“Father”), is an individual believed to be residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child at issue in this Complaint.

3. The parties are the parents of the following minor child:  
   - Emily Thompson, born [____ __, 2013] (currently age 12).

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3, and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, as the prior custody order was issued by this Court and both parties and the minor child continue to reside in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2018 Order”) providing for legal and physical custody of the minor child, Emily Thompson, including a 50/50 physical custody schedule consisting of alternating week‑on/week‑off parenting time for each parent.

6. At the time of the 2018 Order, both parents lived in reasonably close proximity to one another, were in good health, and were able to fully meet the physical and emotional needs of Emily in their respective homes.

7. The 2018 Order was based on the circumstances as they then existed and was consistent with Emily’s best interests at that time, as required by G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31.  

### II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD

8. Under Massachusetts law, an existing custody or parenting time order may be modified where (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

9. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting time determination is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003); *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243–44 (2000); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

10. In evaluating the best interests of the child, the Court must consider, among other things, the child’s safety, welfare, and emotional well‑being, the capacity of each parent to meet the child’s needs, and the stability and continuity of the child’s care. G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–27 (1998); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610, 617–18 (1986).

11. The Court also has broad equitable power to modify custody and parenting orders to protect the child from unnecessary physical or emotional risk and to ensure arrangements are realistically compatible with each parent’s health and abilities. G.L. c. 215, § 6; *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409–10 (1976); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 191–92 (1998).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the 2018 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances in that the Father has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition.

13. On information and belief, Father’s condition significantly affects his mobility, balance, and physical responsiveness, and is expected to worsen over time.

14. As a result of this condition, Father has experienced multiple falls in his home, including falls in areas near stairs and other locations that can present heightened danger to both him and the minor child.

15. Father’s treating medical providers have advised him that he should not be alone with the child in situations that may require quick physical response, including but not limited to being with the child near stairs or other areas where a rapid intervention or physical assistance might be necessary to keep the child safe.

16. Notwithstanding this medical advice, Father has continued to insist upon adherence to the exact same 50/50, alternating‑week physical custody schedule established in the 2018 Order, without any modification to account for his deteriorated physical condition.

17. Father now uses a wheelchair for some or all mobility needs and, at times, relies on the minor child, Emily, to assist him with physically demanding tasks in the home.

18. On multiple occasions, Father has required Emily, a twelve‑year‑old child, to help him transfer between his wheelchair and his bed, and to retrieve or move items for him that he cannot safely access.

19. These tasks can involve Emily bearing or assisting with Father’s weight, or being physically close to Father in situations where his balance is compromised, thereby placing Emily at risk of falling or otherwise being injured.

20. Father’s reliance on Emily to assist him with personal care and mobility tasks is beyond what is age‑appropriate and constitutes a role reversal where the child is placed in a caregiving position for the parent, potentially causing emotional distress and undue responsibility.

21. Father’s physical limitations also impair his ability to respond quickly in emergencies—for example, if Emily were to trip on stairs, choke, suffer a medical event, or otherwise require immediate physical assistance.

22. The combination of Father’s progressive neurological condition, recurring falls, medical advice restricting his ability to safely supervise a minor child in certain environments, and his continued insistence on the unchanged 50/50 parenting schedule constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not and could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the 2018 Order.

23. This change in circumstances directly affects Emily’s safety, physical well‑being, emotional security, and day‑to‑day functioning in Father’s home.

24. Under Massachusetts law, such developments concerning a parent’s health and capacity to provide safe care justify revisiting and modifying custody and parenting time orders. See *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755, 766–68 (1983) (court may alter custody where parent’s condition and conduct affect child’s welfare); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. at 409–10 (recognizing court’s broad authority to protect minor children).

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

25. Emily is twelve years old and has, for several years, experienced a stable, alternating‑week schedule under the 2018 Order when both parents were able to safely provide full‑time care.

26. The Mother has consistently been involved in Emily’s life, meeting her physical, educational, emotional, and social needs, and maintaining a stable home environment.

27. The Mother is in good health and does not suffer from any condition that impairs her ability to provide full‑time, primary physical care for Emily.

28. Mother has observed that Emily expresses anxiety and concern about Father’s physical safety and her own role in helping him, particularly surrounding transfers from wheelchair to bed, concerns about falls, and navigating stairs.

29. Emily has reported feeling scared at times when Father falls or nearly falls, and she worries about both his safety and her own.

30. It is not in Emily’s best interests to feel primarily responsible for managing or assisting with Father’s physical limitations or medical needs.

31. The current 50/50, alternating‑week schedule effectively places Emily for extended, unsupervised blocks of time in an environment where the supervising parent’s physical responsiveness is impaired and where Emily may be called upon to undertake caregiving responsibilities inappropriate for her age.

32. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must consider, among other factors, the child’s safety and well‑being, the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs, and the effect of a proposed arrangement on the child’s emotional development. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595; *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 243–44.

33. When a parent’s health condition creates practical and safety limitations on their ability to provide full‑time physical care, it is appropriate to allocate primary physical custody to the parent best able to provide consistent and safe supervision, while still preserving a meaningful relationship with the other parent through parenting time that is adjusted to the realities of the situation. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 845–46; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. at 191–92.

34. The Father’s diagnosis and functional limitations do not diminish his importance in Emily’s life. Emily loves both parents and benefits from a strong relationship with each of them.

35. However, Emily’s relationship with Father can and should be preserved in ways that are safe and appropriate for both of them, which may include shorter, more structured, or supervised parenting times, environments with fewer physical risks, and schedules that recognize Father’s physical needs.

36. Mother’s proposed modification—shifting to primary physical custody with Mother and adjusting Father’s parenting time to reflect what he can safely manage—will significantly reduce the safety risks posed by Father’s current condition while still maintaining and supporting Emily’s relationship with Father.

37. This proposal aligns with the principle that the Court must fashion custody and parenting arrangements that realistically account for all relevant circumstances while advancing the child’s best interests. See *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. at 225–27; *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. at 617–18.

38. Under Massachusetts law, the Court is not required to wait until a child experiences actual harm before modifying an order; a substantial risk to the child’s safety or emotional well‑being is sufficient to warrant modification. See *Care & Protection of Lillian*, 445 Mass. 333, 339–40 (2005); *Adoption of Carla*, 416 Mass. 510, 517–18 (1993).

39. Continuing the current 50/50, alternating‑week schedule in light of Father’s progressive neurological condition and his increasing safety limitations poses a substantial and continuing risk to Emily’s physical safety and emotional welfare.

40. A modification granting Mother primary physical custody and adjusting Father’s parenting time to a level and structure consistent with his present and anticipated capacities is necessary to protect Emily’s best interests and is consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

41. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2018 Order, specifically Father’s diagnosis with, and functional limitations resulting from, a progressive neurological condition and the associated safety concerns and role‑reversal burden placed upon the minor child.

42. Mother further requests that the Court determine that it is in Emily’s best interests that the 2018 Order be modified as follows:

   a. **Legal Custody.** The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody of Emily, provided that both parties are able and willing to communicate and cooperate regarding major decisions affecting Emily’s health, education, and welfare. In the event that joint legal custody becomes unworkable or contrary to Emily’s best interests, Mother reserves the right to seek further modification to sole legal custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31.

   b. **Primary Physical Custody.** Mother shall have primary physical custody of Emily.

   c. **Parenting Time for Father.** Father shall have parenting time with Emily on a schedule that is safe and appropriate in light of his medical condition and physical capabilities, which may include, by way of example and not limitation:
   - Regular, scheduled parenting time on specific days and times each week, of a duration that Father can safely manage; and/or  
   - Daytime visits in settings that minimize fall and transfer risks (for example, on the first floor of Father’s residence or other accessible locations); and/or  
   - Any overnight parenting time only upon a finding by the Court that such overnight time can be safely managed given Father’s condition and that Emily will not be placed in a caregiving role beyond what is age‑appropriate.

   d. **Safety Conditions.** The Court may impose reasonable conditions aimed at ensuring Emily’s safety during Father’s parenting time, including, as warranted:
   - Requiring that a responsible adult (other than Emily) be present during certain or all portions of Father’s parenting time to assist with transfers, mobility, and emergencies;  
   - Prohibiting Father from relying on Emily to perform physical transfers or tasks that are unsafe or inappropriate for a child of her age;  
   - Requiring Father to follow his medical provider’s safety recommendations regarding activities with Emily (including restrictions relating to stairs and other high‑risk situations).

   e. **Transportation.** The parties shall arrange safe transportation for Emily to and from parenting time, taking into account Father’s condition and any driving or mobility limitations, with primary responsibility for transportation to be allocated by the Court in a manner that best protects Emily’s safety and schooling.

   f. **Further Orders.** The Court may issue any additional orders concerning communication, information sharing regarding Father’s medical status as it relates to Emily’s care, and any other conditions that the Court deems necessary to protect Emily’s best interests.

43. Mother’s requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the changed circumstances, particularly the Father’s health‑related limitations and the associated safety and emotional implications for Emily, while preserving and promoting Emily’s relationship with Father to the greatest extent compatible with her best interests.

44. The requested modification is consistent with Massachusetts statutes and case law governing modifications of custody and parenting time orders and is necessary to ensure Emily’s safety, well‑being, and healthy emotional development.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2018 custody order, arising from the Father’s progressive neurological condition and its impact on his ability to safely provide full‑time care for the minor child;

B. Find and rule that modification of the existing custody and parenting time order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Emily Thompson;

C. Modify the 2018 Order to grant the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, primary physical custody of Emily, while maintaining joint legal custody subject to the child’s best interests, or such other allocation of legal custody as the Court deems just and proper under G.L. c. 208, § 31;

D. Establish a revised parenting time schedule for the Defendant, James Thompson, that reflects his current and reasonably anticipated physical abilities, provides for safe and appropriate contact with Emily, and minimizes Emily’s exposure to physical danger and inappropriate caregiving responsibilities;

E. Impose such reasonable safety‑related conditions on Father’s parenting time as the Court deems necessary and appropriate in light of his medical condition and Emily’s age, including but not limited to the presence of another responsible adult during certain parenting times, adherence to medical safety recommendations, and limitations on Emily performing physical assistance for Father;

F. Issue any further or supplemental orders concerning transportation, communication, and coordination between the parties that are necessary to implement the modified custody and parenting time arrangement;

G. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
