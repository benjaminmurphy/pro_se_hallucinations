    Plaintiff,

SAMANTHA HARRIS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Samantha Harris (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

--------------------------------  
I. PARTIES  
--------------------------------  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all times relevant, Plaintiff was lawfully present at the property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Samantha Harris is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the owner, landlord, and person in control of the three‑unit residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant exercised possession, custody, and control over the exterior premises of the Property, including the sidewalk and walkways used by tenants, guests, and lawful visitors.

--------------------------------  
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
--------------------------------  

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of personal injuries Plaintiff sustained in Worcester, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, placing this action within the subject‑matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4.

6. Venue is proper in Worcester County because the cause of action arose in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the Property is located in Worcester County. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

--------------------------------  
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
--------------------------------  

7. Defendant owns and/or controls a three‑unit apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

8. Defendant, as landlord and possessor of the Property, is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the common areas and approaches to the building, including the sidewalk and access path from the public way used by tenants and their invitees and licensees.

9. In or about mid‑February 2023, a snowstorm affected Worcester, Massachusetts, depositing snow and ice on the sidewalks and walkways in the area, including at 123 Maple Street.

10. Following the snowstorm, Defendant undertook snow removal efforts at the Property and shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk leading to and from the entrances to the building.

11. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or any other ice‑melt, traction, or abrasive material to the shoveled path or surrounding areas despite foreseeable melt‑and‑refreeze conditions in February in Worcester, Massachusetts.

12. Over the course of the next several days, including on and before February 15, 2023, daytime temperatures caused snow and ice to melt, and nighttime temperatures caused repeated refreezing, creating a hazardous, smooth sheet of ice along the path that Defendant had shoveled.

13. As a result of this melt‑and‑refreeze cycle, the narrow shoveled path on the sidewalk at the Property developed into an unreasonably slippery, icy condition that posed a substantial risk of falls to tenants and visitors using the sidewalk in the ordinary and foreseeable manner.

14. Prior to February 15, 2023, tenants of the Property observed the dangerous icy condition on the sidewalk and on the path shoveled by Defendant.

15. Those tenants notified Defendant of the hazardous condition by text message, including sending Defendant photographs of the ice covering the path and sidewalk.

16. Upon information and belief, Defendant responded to these tenant complaints by stating, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” and failed and refused to take reasonable remedial measures to make the sidewalk safe.

17. Defendant did not spread salt, sand, or other de‑icing material; did not scrape or chop away the ice; did not close off or warn against use of the hazardous section of the sidewalk; and did not otherwise address the dangerous condition despite having actual notice of it.

18. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises at 123 Maple Street in her capacity as a grocery delivery worker, delivering groceries to one of the tenants of the building.

19. Plaintiff used the sidewalk and entrance path at 123 Maple Street in the normal, foreseeable, and intended manner as a pedestrian approaching the building to complete her delivery.

20. As Plaintiff walked along the shoveled path on the sidewalk toward the entrance, her feet suddenly slipped out from under her as a result of the sheet of ice that had formed on the path.

21. Plaintiff lost her balance and fell backwards onto the icy surface, landing violently on her lower back.

22. The surface where Plaintiff fell was extremely slick and covered with a layer of ice created by the melt‑and‑refreeze process, which had been occurring for several days under typical February weather conditions.

23. The icy condition was not adequately treated, mitigated, or remediated by Defendant, even though Defendant had notice of the condition and a reasonable opportunity to correct or warn of it.

24. As a direct and proximate result of this fall, Plaintiff suffered a lower back injury, including pain, stiffness, and loss of range of motion.

25. Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for her lower back, including but not limited to diagnostic visits, follow‑up appointments, and related medical care.

26. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses related to the injuries suffered in the fall.

27. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week, causing her to lose approximately $800 in wages.

28. Plaintiff has also endured physical pain, discomfort, and emotional distress associated with the injury and the recovery process.

29. The injury to Plaintiff, her lost wages, and her medical expenses were a foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk and access path at the Property in a reasonably safe condition during winter weather.

30. Defendant’s failure to properly treat, sand, salt, or otherwise address the known icy condition on the shoveled path, after notice and with reasonable time and means to correct the condition, constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law.

--------------------------------  
IV. NEGLIGENCE (SINGLE COUNT)  
--------------------------------  

31. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts common law, a property owner or person in control of real property owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to the maintenance and safety of the premises, including protection against foreseeable hazards such as accumulations of snow and ice. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 931 N.E.2d 142 (2010).

33. In Papadopoulos, the Supreme Judicial Court abrogated the prior distinction between “natural” and “unnatural” accumulations of snow and ice and held that property owners owe “a duty to lawful visitors to use reasonable care to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition in view of the foreseeable risks of harm,” including risks from snow and ice. Id. at 369–383.

34. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful visitor and business invitee to the Property, a duty to use reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk, approaches, and access path in a reasonably safe condition in light of foreseeable risks of harm presented by winter weather, melt‑and‑refreeze cycles, and related snow and ice conditions. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708, 297 N.E.2d 43 (1973) (abolishing distinction between invitees and licensees and imposing a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

35. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, Defendant’s liability in negligence is determined under principles of comparative negligence, and Plaintiff’s recovery is not barred so long as her negligence, if any, is not greater than the negligence of Defendant.

36. Defendant, as landlord and person in control of the Property’s common areas, also had a duty to maintain the common areas, including the sidewalk and entry path, in a reasonably safe condition for tenants and those lawfully on the premises at their invitation. See Humphrey v. Byron, 447 Mass. 322, 850 N.E.2d 1044 (2006); Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162, 402 N.E.2d 1045 (1980).

37. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or possessor of land may be liable for injuries resulting from an unsafe condition on the premises where the owner knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the condition and unreasonably failed to correct or warn of it. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 292 N.E.2d 863 (1973); Falco v. James A. Fulford, Inc., 354 Mass. 299, 237 N.E.2d 33 (1968).

38. Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous icy condition because tenants texted Defendant and sent photographs depicting the ice on the sidewalk and on the shoveled path prior to February 15, 2023.

39. Even if Defendant did not have actual notice at the earliest stages, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazardous condition because the melt‑and‑refreeze cycle and resulting ice accumulated over a period of several days under predictable February weather conditions in Worcester; a reasonably prudent property owner exercising due care would have discovered and remedied the icy condition. See Deignan v. Lubarsky, 318 Mass. 661, 63 N.E.2d 168 (1945).

40. Defendant undertook to shovel a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but unreasonably failed to follow through with additional, necessary, and reasonable measures—such as applying salt, sand, or other de‑icing or traction materials—to reduce or eliminate the risk of slipping created by the melt‑and‑refreeze conditions. See Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 384–385 (discussing reasonable care in snow and ice removal).

41. By affirmatively choosing to rely on “the sun” to “take care of” the condition and refusing to apply readily available and inexpensive measures (such as salt or sand) or to post warnings or block off the area, Defendant failed to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would under like circumstances.

42. Defendant’s conduct in failing to properly maintain the sidewalk and in disregarding tenant reports and photographs of the icy condition constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff.

43. Defendant was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, that delivery workers, mail carriers, guests, and other lawful visitors would be using the sidewalk and narrow shoveled path to access the Property and that falls on ice are a common, foreseeable, and serious hazard.

44. Defendant’s duty encompassed taking reasonable steps—such as monitoring the condition of the path, responding to complaints, applying salt or sand, scraping or chopping away ice, or warning or redirecting pedestrians—to protect lawful visitors from the known and foreseeable risk of slipping and falling on ice. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 987 N.E.2d 1187 (2013) (discussing premises liability for known risks).

45. Defendant’s failure to take any of these measures after actual notice of the icy condition and after undertaking partial snow removal (thereby creating a narrow path that invited use) unreasonably increased the risk of harm to Plaintiff.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell on the ice on February 15, 2023, at approximately 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603, and suffered injuries to her lower back.

47. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff in a negligence action must prove duty, breach, causation, and damages. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 849 N.E.2d 829 (2006). Here:

    a. Duty: Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk and access path in a reasonably safe condition in light of foreseeable winter conditions and the known icy hazard.

    b. Breach: Defendant breached that duty by failing to properly treat, sand, or salt the icy path; by failing to warn Plaintiff or others; and by ignoring tenant complaints and photographs documenting the dangerous condition.

    c. Causation: Defendant’s breach of duty was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip and fall and resulting injuries; absent Defendant’s negligence, the dangerous icy condition would likely have been mitigated or eliminated, and Plaintiff would not have fallen.

    d. Damages: Plaintiff suffered physical injury, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and endured pain and suffering and emotional distress as a consequence of Defendant’s negligence.

48. Plaintiff’s actions on the date of the incident were reasonable under the circumstances. She walked on a path that had been shoveled by Defendant, which was the intended and apparent route for access to the building, and she did not unreasonably expose herself to known or obvious danger.

49. To the extent Defendant alleges comparative negligence, Plaintiff denies any negligence on her part; however, if Plaintiff is found to have been negligent, such negligence was less than that of Defendant, and Plaintiff’s claims are preserved under G.L. c. 231, § 85. See Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 525 N.E.2d 1305 (1988).

50. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were a reasonably foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in winter maintenance of the sidewalk and access path and Defendant’s disregard of actual notice of the dangerous condition.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages, among others:

    a. Medical expenses of approximately $2,500 for evaluation and treatment of her lower back injury;

    b. Lost wages of approximately $800 arising from approximately one week of missed work due to her injuries;

    c. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, limitations in activities, and discomfort associated with the injury and its treatment;

    d. Emotional distress and anxiety associated with the incident, its aftermath, and the disruption to Plaintiff’s normal activities and work; and

    e. Any future pain, suffering, medical treatment, or limitations reasonably attributable to the injuries caused by the fall.

52. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60H, Plaintiff seeks full and fair compensation for all elements of her damages recognized under Massachusetts tort law, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life.

53. Plaintiff also seeks prejudgment interest on any judgment in her favor at the rate provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B (for personal injury actions), from the date of commencement of this action.

54. Plaintiff further seeks taxable costs as allowed by law under G.L. c. 261, §§ 1 et seq.
