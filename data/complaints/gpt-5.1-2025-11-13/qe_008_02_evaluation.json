It holds that pervasive criminal activity in those common areas, if left unaddressed by the landlord, can constitute a breach because it seriously interferes with tenants\u2019 ability to use sidewalks, streets, parking lots and recreation areas.

If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"
