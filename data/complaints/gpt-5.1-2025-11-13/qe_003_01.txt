CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Olivia Martinez (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant James Houghton (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Olivia Martinez is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is a tenant of the residential premises located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Unit ___, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant James Houghton is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment, seeking damages and other relief arising out of Defendant’s breach of Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.

5. The Boston Housing Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action involving residential housing located in Boston, Massachusetts and concerns the relationship of landlord and tenant and the use and condition of residential premises.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because the Premises are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court and the acts and omissions complained of occurred there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about February 1, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a studio apartment located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Apartment is $1,300, payable to Defendant.

9. Prior to signing the lease and taking occupancy, Plaintiff viewed the Apartment in or around January 2023.

10. During the pre-rental showing, Plaintiff observed visible water stains on the ceiling of the Apartment.

11. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the water stains and whether there had been any leaks.

12. Defendant affirmatively represented to Plaintiff that the stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”

13. Relying on Defendant’s assurance that the leak had been fixed and that the water problem had been resolved, Plaintiff agreed to rent the Apartment and entered into the tenancy beginning on February 1, 2023.

14. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, during the first significant rainstorm while she was in possession, water began leaking through the ceiling at or near the same location as the water stains Plaintiff had previously observed.

15. The leak was not merely minor or cosmetic; water dripped from the ceiling into the living area of the Apartment, including onto furniture and personal belongings.

16. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water leak and requested that it be properly repaired.

17. On multiple subsequent occasions over the next several months, during additional rainstorms, the same ceiling area leaked again, with water intruding into the living space.

18. Each time, Plaintiff complained to Defendant and requested that he remedy the leak and its underlying cause.

19. Defendant repeatedly dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints, characterizing the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and telling Plaintiff that she knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.

20. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints over multiple months, Defendant failed and refused to make adequate repairs to stop the ongoing leak or to correct the underlying condition.

21. During at least one particularly heavy storm, the leak became so severe that water dripped onto and soaked Plaintiff’s couch and onto a laptop left on the coffee table.

22. Plaintiff’s laptop was rendered unusable and had to be replaced at a cost of approximately $900.

23. As the leaking continued over time, the affected area of the Apartment developed a musty odor, suggesting dampness and likely mold or mildew growth.

24. Following the development of the musty smell and continuing water intrusion, Plaintiff began experiencing physical symptoms including frequent headaches that she believes are related to the unhealthy living conditions caused by the moisture and possible mold.

25. The water infiltration and resulting conditions forced Plaintiff to rearrange her living space to avoid the leaking area and associated odors.

26. Plaintiff moved her bed away from the area of the leak and now effectively uses only about half of the Apartment, losing full use and enjoyment of the rental premises for which she pays rent.

27. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises has been substantially and materially interfered with by the continuing leak, water damage, musty odor, and suspected mold, along with Defendant’s ongoing failure to remedy these conditions.

28. Defendant’s failure to repair the leak and stop the repeated water intrusion has continued for months, from shortly after the start of Plaintiff’s tenancy and throughout much of the eight-month period she has resided at the Premises.

29. The existence of a recurring roof or ceiling leak, water damage, and possible mold in a small studio apartment adversely affects the health, safety, and comfort of a residential tenant and is a serious condition that substantially interferes with the use and enjoyment of the Premises.

30. Defendant has at all times had the ability and responsibility, as landlord and owner, to investigate the source of the leak and to perform proper repairs to prevent water from entering the Apartment.

31. Instead, Defendant has chosen to minimize the problem and has failed to take reasonable and timely steps to correct it, despite multiple notices from Plaintiff and repeated opportunities to do so.

32. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to adequately address the leak and related conditions, Plaintiff has suffered: (a) loss of use of a significant portion of her living space; (b) property damage, including the destruction of a laptop computer valued at approximately $900; (c) discomfort and physical symptoms, including headaches; (d) stress, inconvenience, and disruption of her daily life; and (e) diminished value of the tenancy for which she has consistently paid the full monthly rent.

33. Plaintiff has continued to pay her monthly rent of $1,300 despite the ongoing conditions and the substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises.

34. Plaintiff estimates that at least several months of her tenancy have been materially affected by these conditions to the point that the Apartment’s rental value was significantly reduced.

35. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has suffered at least $900 in actual damages, including but not limited to property damage and loss of use, as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

36. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully set forth herein.

37. Under Massachusetts law, residential tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, both by statute and by common law. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in substance, that a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.

38. The covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibits serious and substantial interference with the tenant’s tenancy, including interference with the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises for residential purposes.  

   See, e.g., *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977) (landlord liable for substantial interference with tenant’s use and enjoyment even without intent to harm tenant); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982) (repeated flooding and failure to repair can support quiet enjoyment claim); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

39. A landlord’s failure to remedy recurring water leaks, structural problems, or conditions affecting health and safety can constitute an unlawful “interference” under G.L. c. 186, § 14, even if the landlord’s conduct is characterized as an omission rather than an affirmative act. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03; *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

40. Landlords have an obligation to maintain residential premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and applicable housing regulations, and violations of those standards that substantially impair the health or safety of tenants or materially interfere with their use and enjoyment of the premises may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979).

41. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.500 et seq., the State Sanitary Code requires that the roof, walls, windows, and structural elements of residential dwellings be watertight, weather-tight, and free from chronic dampness, leaks, and conditions conducive to mold and mildew.

42. Defendant’s failure to correct the ongoing ceiling leak, resulting in repeated water intrusion into the Apartment, chronic dampness, and a musty odor consistent with possible mold, constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code and a serious defect affecting health and safety within the meaning of *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–201, and *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 199–201.

43. By repeatedly disregarding Plaintiff’s complaints and failing to take reasonable steps to repair the recurring leak and its underlying cause, Defendant has directly and/or indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

44. Plaintiff’s loss of the use of a substantial portion of her small studio apartment, the presence of chronic dampness and musty odors, and the corresponding health-related symptoms and discomfort she has experienced constitute a “serious interference” with her tenancy. See *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51; *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 716–18; *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 284.

45. The recurring leak and resulting conditions are not minor inconveniences but rather significant problems that materially and adversely affect the habitability, comfort, and value of Plaintiff’s home. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 103–05 (recognizing repeated leaking, flooding, and failure to remedy defects as actionable breaches of quiet enjoyment).

46. A landlord may be found to have breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment where, after notice of serious defects, the landlord fails to take reasonable steps to repair them within a reasonable time. *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 199–201; *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–201; see also *Lipsitt v. Plaud*, 466 Mass. 240, 244–45 (2013) (recognizing negligence and statutory obligations tied to housing conditions).

47. Defendant had actual notice of the water problem even before Plaintiff moved in, as evidenced by the preexisting water stains on the ceiling that Plaintiff specifically questioned during the showing.

48. Defendant then had repeated actual notice once Plaintiff, on multiple occasions, complained about the renewed leaks after she took occupancy.

49. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to exercise due care or take reasonable, timely, and effective action to stop the leak and remediate the resulting damage and unhealthy conditions, thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

50. Defendant’s conduct was at least negligent and indifferent, and in the context of G.L. c. 186, § 14, such conduct is sufficient to establish a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–05; *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 716–18.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:  

   a. Damage to personal property (including the loss of a laptop valued at approximately $900);  
   b. Loss of use of a significant portion of her Apartment over a period of months;  
   c. Physical discomfort, including headaches;  
   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, disruption, and loss of the benefit of her bargain; and  
   e. Payment of full rent for a dwelling that was not fully habitable or reasonably fit for its intended use during the periods of leaking and dampness.

52. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

53. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent (3 × $1,300 = $3,900), whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, notwithstanding that she is currently self-represented. See *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 201–02 (discussing statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

54. To the extent the Court finds that Defendant’s conduct was willful, knowing, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, such finding further supports an award of the statutory minimum damages of three months’ rent under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 103–05; *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51.
