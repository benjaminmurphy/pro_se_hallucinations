JESSICA THOMPSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL SMITH,  
  Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered on June 15, 2019, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an adult individual residing in Massachusetts and is the mother and primary custodian of the minor child, Ava Smith, born [DOB omitted for privacy] (“Ava”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith (“Father”), is an adult individual, believed to reside in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and is the father of Ava.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, because this Court issued the original custody and parenting time judgment and the child resides within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

4. On or about June 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) concerning custody and parenting time for the minor child, Ava Smith (the “2019 Order”).

5. Under the 2019 Order, Mother was awarded primary physical custody of Ava. Father was awarded parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight each Wednesday, with the expectation that both parties lived in close proximity and that the midweek overnight would not interfere with the child’s school attendance, rest, or educational performance.

6. At the time the 2019 Order was entered, both parties resided in the same town, and the transportation required for Father’s midweek overnight was a short approximately five-minute drive to Ava’s school the following morning.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the entry of the 2019 Order, Father has relocated his residence to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, approximately ninety (90) miles away from Ava’s school and Mother’s residence.

8. Despite this relocation, Father insists on exercising the Wednesday midweek overnight on the same terms as when the parties lived in the same town.

9. Under the current practice, Father picks Ava up from school on Wednesdays, drives her approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence on Cape Cod, and then wakes her at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings in order to drive her back approximately ninety (90) miles so that she can attend school.

10. This midweek travel requires Ava to be in the car for extended periods on school nights and very early in the morning, resulting in significantly reduced sleep and rest.

11. As a direct result of this schedule, Ava is consistently tired, irritable, and less able to focus in school on Thursdays.

12. Ava’s teacher has informed Mother that Ava’s participation, attentiveness, and academic engagement have noticeably dropped on Thursdays, coinciding with the nights that Ava spends with Father under the midweek overnight schedule.

13. The change in Father’s residence and the resulting extreme midweek transportation demands and sleep disruption for the child are material changes in circumstances that were not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2019 Order.

14. The present midweek overnight schedule is no longer in Ava’s best interests, given her age, school schedule, distance of travel, and demonstrable negative impact on her rest and school performance.

15. Mother is not seeking to eliminate Father’s relationship with Ava, but to adjust parenting time so that the child’s best interests and welfare are protected, especially with respect to school nights.

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW

16. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and, as applicable to custody determinations concerning minor children, G.L. c. 209C, § 20), the Probate and Family Court has the authority to modify judgments relative to custody and parenting time “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require,” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the child.

17. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that to modify an existing custody or parenting time order, the moving party must demonstrate (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 190 (1998); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

18. The “best interests of the child” standard is paramount in determining custody and parenting time arrangements. G.L. c. 208, § 31; see also Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003) (the child’s stability, welfare, and development must be central in the Court’s analysis).

19. A significant relocation or change in the living circumstances of a parent may constitute a material change warranting modification when it meaningfully affects the child’s schedule, stability, or welfare. See Williams v. Pitney, 409 Mass. 449, 454–55 (1991) (recognizing changed circumstances relating to residential arrangements and impact on the child as a basis to revisit custody/visitation); Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 151–52 (2015) (modification appropriate where changes in parental circumstances materially affect child).

20. Courts have broad discretion to modify parenting time to reduce excessive travel and disruption to the child’s routine when such arrangements are no longer consistent with the child’s best interests. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (best interests analysis includes stability of environment and avoiding needless disruption); Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 246–47 (2015) (modification affirmed where changed circumstances made existing parenting schedule detrimental to child’s welfare).

21. The child’s educational needs and ability to get adequate rest are important aspects of the “best interests” inquiry. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–46 (considering stability and developmental needs); Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 658–59 (2002) (emphasizing protection of child’s emotional and developmental well-being).

22. Where a schedule that was once appropriate becomes detrimental due to changes in circumstances, the Court is not bound to preserve the existing arrangement; rather, it must fashion a parenting plan that reflects the current realities and the child’s welfare. See Rosenberg, 428 Mass. at 190; Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 868–69 (2006) (modification justified where prior order no longer served child’s best interests).

23. The Court’s power to modify custody and parenting time is ongoing and is exercised to respond flexibly to the evolving needs of the child and the circumstances of the parents. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710–11 (1985) (recognizing continuing jurisdiction to adjust custodial arrangements consistent with child’s best interests).

24. The significant increase in travel distance, the requirement that Ava wake at approximately 4:30 a.m. to travel back to school, the observed impact on her school participation, and the child’s chronic fatigue on Thursdays together constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances, and the continued enforcement of the 2019 midweek schedule is inconsistent with Ava’s best interests.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

25. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the 2019 Order and that modification is necessary to serve Ava’s best interests.

26. Mother seeks a modification of the 2019 Order as follows:

   a. Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight at Father’s residence, to avoid the extreme ninety-mile commute on school nights and the resulting early-morning travel and sleep disruption for Ava.

   b. Provide that Father’s parenting time shall consist of:

   - Alternating weekends from Friday after school (or at a specific time such as 5:00 p.m.) through Sunday at a reasonable return time (for example, 5:00 p.m.), with the precise times as the Court deems appropriate; and  

   - Reasonable non-overnight midweek contact (such as a Wednesday afternoon or early evening visit or video/telephone contact) that does not require Ava to travel long distances or interfere with her sleep, homework, or school obligations, as may be agreed upon by the parties or ordered by the Court.

   c. Clarify that all exchanges shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Ava’s school schedule and avoids excessively early wake-up times on school days.

27. Mother further requests that any future parenting time schedule be structured to protect Ava’s ability to obtain adequate rest, attend school consistently and on time, and fully participate in her education.

28. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the negative impact of Father’s relocation and the midweek overnight arrangement on Ava’s welfare, while preserving Father’s meaningful relationship with Ava through regular weekend parenting time and appropriate additional contact.

### VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2019 custody and parenting time order, due in substantial part to Father’s relocation approximately ninety miles away and the resulting impact of the midweek overnight on the minor child’s rest, school attendance, and educational engagement;

2. Find that continuing the existing Wednesday midweek overnight, given Father’s current residence and the required 4:30 a.m. wake-up and long commute, is not in the best interests of the minor child, Ava Smith;

3. Modify the June 15, 2019 Judgment or Order to:

   a. Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight at Father’s residence;

   b. Establish that Father’s parenting time shall consist primarily of alternating weekends, with specific start and end times as the Court finds appropriate, and any additional non-overnight midweek contact that does not unreasonably interfere with Ava’s sleep or schooling; and  

   c. Include such additional or clarifying terms as are necessary to minimize excessive travel and disruption to Ava’s school routine.

4. Order that each parent shall refrain from scheduling or insisting upon parenting time in a manner that requires the minor child to engage in excessively early-morning long-distance travel on school days, or otherwise materially interferes with her educational needs and ability to obtain adequate rest.

5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and consistent with the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
