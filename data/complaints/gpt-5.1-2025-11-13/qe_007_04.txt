v.                                  Civil Action No. _________

DAVID THOMPSON,  
Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this action against Defendant David Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at and renting the residential apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Unit ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (“Premises”).

2. Defendant David Thompson is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (“Property”), including the Premises rented by Plaintiff.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts landlord–tenant law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is approximately One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), exclusive of interest, costs, and any statutory multiple damages and attorney’s fees, and therefore is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and related provisions, the Cambridge District Court has jurisdiction over this landlord–tenant dispute.

7. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court because the Property and Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–7 as if fully set forth herein.

9. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

10. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises since on or about June 1, 2021.

11. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Premises is Two Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($2,200.00), payable to Defendant.

12. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been current in her rent payments and has complied with her obligations as a tenant.

13. As a matter of Massachusetts common law and statute, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and Defendant’s conduct must not substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
   See, e.g., *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33 (1929); *Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.*, 340 Mass. 124 (1959).

14. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is liable if he “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

15. Beginning approximately in or about October 2025, Defendant commenced substantial renovation and construction work in the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises at the Property.

16. The construction has involved, among other things, frequent and loud drilling, hammering, banging, and loud conversations among construction workers.

17. The construction noise has typically occurred on weekdays, beginning at approximately 8:00 a.m. and lasting until approximately 5:00 p.m.

18. Defendant informed Plaintiff in advance that renovations would occur in the adjacent unit, but did not inform Plaintiff that the work would extend for months or significantly interfere with her ability to use the Premises as a home and workplace.

19. Plaintiff works from home and must participate in work-related calls, meetings, and other tasks that require concentration and quiet during normal business hours.

20. The intensity and persistence of the construction noise has made it extremely difficult for Plaintiff to conduct her work-from-home activities, participate in calls, and otherwise use the Premises as a reasonably quiet living and working environment.

21. The construction activities have also resulted in dust and debris entering Plaintiff’s Premises, including through vents and common air circulation pathways.

22. The dust intrusion has negatively affected the cleanliness and comfort of the Premises and has required additional cleaning and attention from Plaintiff.

23. The disruption from the construction—noise, dust, and ongoing disturbance—has persisted for approximately two months and, upon information and belief, is expected by Defendant to continue for an additional month or two.

24. As a result of the continuing noise and dust over an extended period, Plaintiff has suffered significant disruption of her daily life and work, increased stress, and an inability to use and enjoy the Premises in a normal, reasonable manner.

25. Defendant has been aware, or reasonably should have been aware, that extended, intense construction adjacent to Plaintiff’s home during business hours, resulting in noise and dust, would materially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

26. Defendant offered Plaintiff a small, one-time rent reduction of approximately One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) to compensate for the disruptions, but this reduction did not remotely compensate for the level and duration of interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

27. Plaintiff notified, complained to, or otherwise communicated with Defendant about the disruptive nature of the construction and its impact on her ability to live and work in the Premises.

28. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate or prevent the substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, such as relocating Plaintiff temporarily, substantially increasing rent abatement, improving dust control, changing work methods or scheduling, or otherwise addressing the problem.

29. The substantial and prolonged noise, dust, and related disturbances caused by renovations under Defendant’s control have effectively deprived Plaintiff of the full, reasonable use of her home for an extended period, and have significantly interfered with her ability to peacefully reside in and enjoy the Premises.

30. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord is liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord’s acts or omissions cause a substantial interference with the tenant’s use of the premises.  
    See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

31. Defendant’s actions and omissions in connection with the renovations constitute a direct and indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law.

32. Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, emotional distress, inconvenience, and disruption of work and daily life.

33. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that her damages attributable to Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment of the Premises are at least One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), exclusive of any statutory treble damages, costs, and attorney’s fees available under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

34. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–33 as though fully set forth herein.

35. Plaintiff is a lawful residential tenant of the Premises under a tenancy with Defendant that commenced on or about June 1, 2021.

36. As a matter of Massachusetts law, Plaintiff’s tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and Defendant also has express statutory obligations under G.L. c. 186, § 14 not to directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  
    See *Rampersad v. Latalladi*, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 661 (1987); *Sullivan v. Rent Control Bd. of Brookline*, 397 Mass. 738 (1986).

37. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” and that a landlord who violates this provision “shall also be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

38. A landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 does not require proof of malice; it is sufficient that the landlord’s conduct, or that of persons acting under the landlord’s authority, results in a substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.  
    See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

39. Massachusetts courts have held that persistent and substantial disturbances originating from activity within the landlord’s control, even if ostensibly lawful or serving a legitimate purpose, may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment when they materially impair the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.  
    See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

40. Here, Defendant, directly or through contractors and agents, caused or allowed extensive renovation and construction work immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises, resulting in persistent, loud noise and dust over an extended period of approximately two months, with additional months anticipated.

41. The level, frequency, and duration of the construction noise—drilling, hammering, banging, and loud voices from early morning until late afternoon on weekdays—has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

42. The construction has also caused dust and debris to infiltrate Plaintiff’s Premises through vents or other openings, further impairing her comfort and use of the space.

43. Plaintiff’s need to work from home during standard business hours made the ongoing and intrusive noise particularly disruptive, interfering with her ability to conduct calls, concentrate, and use the Premises in a manner reasonably contemplated by the tenancy.

44. Defendant was or should have been aware of the foreseeable impact of such extensive construction on Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment but failed to adequately mitigate, schedule, or otherwise control the work to avoid substantial interference.

45. Defendant’s limited offer of a one-time rent reduction of approximately One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) did not cure the continuing interference or reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the loss of quiet enjoyment over multiple months.

46. The cumulative effect of Defendant’s actions and omissions has been to substantially and unreasonably deprive Plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of her home for an extended period.

47. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;  
    b. Interference with work-from-home activities and related stress;  
    c. Discomfort and inconvenience from persistent noise and dust; and  
    d. Emotional distress and disruption of daily living.

49. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee.  
    See also *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).

50. Plaintiff presently seeks actual damages in the amount of at least One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), plus such statutory enhancements, costs, and fees as the Court deems appropriate.

51. To the extent applicable, the standards governing landlord liability for substantial interference with tenants’ rights and quiet enjoyment in Massachusetts are further reflected in cases such as *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (reaffirming protections for residential tenants), and *Board of Health of N. Adams v. Lewis*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 161 (1986) (recognizing landlord responsibilities regarding conditions affecting habitability and use).
