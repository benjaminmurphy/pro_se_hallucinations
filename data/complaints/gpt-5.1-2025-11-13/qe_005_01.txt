-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Anderson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at and renting the residential apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Massachusetts (“the Premises”).

2. Defendant Michael Anderson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, operates, controls, manages, and/or acts as landlord for the triple‑decker residential building located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (“the Property”), including the Premises rented by Plaintiff and the third‑floor unit directly above Plaintiff.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §19 and G.L. c. 212, §3, as this is a civil action for money damages well within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§1, 2, and 8 because the Property that is the subject of this action is located in Somerville, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, and the events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred in Somerville.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the second‑floor apartment at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, with Defendant as landlord.

6. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises from on or about January 15, 2022 to the present, and has paid monthly rent of $1,500, as required by her lease and/or tenancy agreement with Defendant.

7. Plaintiff’s written lease with Defendant expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant was the landlord of the Premises and of the third‑floor apartment in the same building, and had the right and power to regulate, control, and enforce lease terms and house rules with respect to the third‑floor tenants whose conduct is at issue.

9. Approximately six months prior to the date of this Complaint, new tenants moved into the third‑floor unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment.

10. Since those tenants moved in, Plaintiff has been subjected to persistent, excessive, and unreasonable noise from the third‑floor unit, including but not limited to:

   a. Heavy stomping and loud footfalls at all hours of the day and night;

   b. Loud music played late into the evening and nighttime hours;

   c. Sounds consistent with furniture and/or other large objects being moved or dragged, frequently around midnight and during late‑night hours.

11. The above‑described noise has been recurrent, frequent, and prolonged, and has regularly continued into late‑night and early‑morning hours, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and use and enjoy her home.

12. Plaintiff has repeatedly attempted to resolve the matter informally and reasonably. Plaintiff personally and politely asked the third‑floor tenants to reduce the noise and to be mindful of the late‑night disturbances.

13. After Plaintiff’s initial request, the third‑floor tenants briefly reduced their noise for approximately one week, but they then returned to the same or similar loud and disruptive behavior described above.

14. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant, her landlord, about the excessive noise and the resulting interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises on at least five or six separate occasions over the past several months.

15. Plaintiff complained to Defendant both orally and in writing (including, upon information and belief, by texts, emails, and/or other written communications), informing Defendant that:

   a. The noise from the third‑floor tenants was extremely loud, frequent, and unreasonable;

   b. The noise regularly occurred at late‑night and early‑morning hours;

   c. Plaintiff’s sleep and health were being significantly affected; and

   d. The situation was making the Premises unlivable and depriving Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of her home.

16. Plaintiff reasonably requested that Defendant take effective steps to address and abate the noise, including enforcing lease provisions, house rules, and/or taking any other reasonable actions that a landlord in the exercise of due care and good faith would take under similar circumstances.

17. Defendant spoke to the third‑floor tenants once, but thereafter told Plaintiff words to the effect that he “can’t control how people live,” indicating an unwillingness to take further reasonable steps to remedy the ongoing disturbance.

18. Despite Plaintiff’s multiple complaints and requests for help, Defendant failed and refused to:

   a. Investigate the complaints adequately;

   b. Impose or enforce reasonable rules or lease provisions to prevent excessive noise;

   c. Warn or otherwise meaningfully discipline the offending tenants;

   d. Take further reasonable steps to abate the disturbance or protect Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

19. The third‑floor tenants continued the excessive and unreasonable conduct, and Defendant’s ineffective and inadequate response allowed the disturbances to persist.

20. As a direct and foreseeable result of the ongoing noise and Defendant’s failure to adequately respond, Plaintiff has averaged only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night over a sustained period of months.

21. Plaintiff’s chronic sleep deprivation has caused significant physical and emotional distress, including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and general deterioration of her well‑being.

22. Plaintiff’s exhaustion from lack of sleep resulted in her falling asleep at her desk at work, for which she received a written warning from her employer, placing her employment at risk and causing additional stress and anxiety.

23. Plaintiff sought medical assistance for her sleep problems. Her physician prescribed sleep medication to address the insomnia and sleep disruption caused by the excessive noise.

24. Plaintiff currently incurs out‑of‑pocket costs of approximately $40 per month for this prescription medication, which she would not otherwise have needed but for the disturbance and Defendant’s inaction.

25. Plaintiff has attempted various mitigation measures at her own expense, including purchasing earplugs, buying a white‑noise machine, and rearranging her bedroom, but these attempts have proven insufficient to overcome the level and duration of noise.

26. Due to the continuing excessive noise and the Landlord’s failure to take adequate corrective action, Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her apartment for ordinary residential purposes—particularly for rest and sleep—has been substantially and unreasonably impaired.

27. Plaintiff has remained current in her rent obligations during the relevant period, paying $1,500 per month, despite not receiving the full benefit of the quiet enjoyment to which she is entitled.

28. Based on the severity, duration, and consequences of the interference, Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has suffered at least $2,000 in actual damages, including but not limited to: loss of use and enjoyment, out‑of‑pocket costs for sleep medication and mitigation efforts, and consequential harm related to her employment and health.

29. All conditions precedent, if any, to the bringing of this action have occurred, been performed, or been waived.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14**

30. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, §14; *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

32. G.L. c. 186, §14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

33. A landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, §14 is not limited to physical entries onto the premises but extends to substantial interferences with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises that are the “natural and probable consequence” of the landlord’s acts or omissions. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from serious interferences with the tenancy, including conditions that render the premises unfit for the purposes for which they were rented, or that prevent the tenant from using the premises in a customary, reasonable manner. *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in all residential leases and cannot be waived by the tenant. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 368 Mass. 595, 603–04 (1975).

36. As landlord, Defendant owed Plaintiff a statutory and contractual duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, and to refrain from conduct—and from tolerating conduct under his control—that he knew or should have known would substantially and unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s occupancy.

37. The third‑floor tenants whose conduct is at issue are also tenants of Defendant, in the same building, and subject to leases and/or tenancies controlled by Defendant.

38. Defendant had the power, authority, and obligation as landlord to impose, interpret, and enforce reasonable rules and lease provisions regarding noise, nuisance, and disturbance, and to take reasonable remedial steps when serious, ongoing disturbances interfered with another tenant’s quiet enjoyment.

39. Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant of the excessive noise and its serious impact on her sleep, health, and ability to live peacefully in her home, thereby giving Defendant actual notice of the interference with her quiet enjoyment.

40. With such notice, Defendant was required to take reasonable steps in good faith to address and abate the disturbance. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 717–19 (landlord liable for noise from lounge operated on premises where interference was natural and probable consequence of landlord’s arrangements and failure to control); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994) (landlord may be liable for failure to exercise control to prevent foreseeable harm and disturbance where it retains the ability to do so).

41. Defendant’s limited response—speaking to the third‑floor tenants once and then stating that he “can’t control how people live”—was inadequate and unreasonable given the severity, frequency, and duration of the disturbance and the substantial impairment of Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

42. By failing to take further reasonable, available steps to enforce lease terms, impose conditions, or otherwise control the conduct of the offending tenants within his building and under his authority, Defendant effectively permitted, tolerated, and acquiesced in the continuing disturbance.

43. Under *Blackett v. Olanoff*, a landlord “indirectly” interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14 where the landlord’s actions or inactions foreseeably result in a substantial interference with the tenant’s use of the premises, even when the immediate disturbance is caused by third parties. 371 Mass. at 718–19.

44. Similarly, where a landlord has notice of serious misconduct or disturbance by one tenant that substantially interferes with another tenant’s use of her apartment and fails to take reasonable steps within his power to address it, the landlord’s omission can constitute an “indirect” interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973) (recognizing landlord duties in context of conditions seriously affecting habitability and use); *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

45. The repeated, late‑night, and excessive noise from the third‑floor tenants, persisting after Defendant had actual notice and failed to take reasonable remedial action, substantially and materially impaired Plaintiff’s ability to use her apartment as a residence, especially for sleep and rest.

46. This level of interference rises to the level of a substantial and serious impairment of tenancy required to establish a breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (severe flooding and resulting conditions constituted breach of quiet enjoyment); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983–84 (persistent roof leak and related conditions established serious interference); *Sampier v. Zaretsky*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 238–39 (1987) (continuing conditions and landlord inaction supported claim under G.L. c. 186, §14).

47. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to abate the disturbance, after notice and opportunity to do so, was at least negligent and constituted a knowing and willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, §14.

48. Defendant’s conduct and omissions as alleged herein amounted to a direct or indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, §14 and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in her lease.

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of her home, particularly the ability to sleep and rest during normal nighttime hours;

   b. Physical and emotional distress, including chronic fatigue, insomnia, and anxiety;

   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for sleep medication and mitigation efforts such as earplugs and a white‑noise machine;

   d. Employment‑related harm, including a written warning from her employer and associated emotional distress.

50. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

51. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages are reasonably estimated at no less than $2,000 and continue to accrue; three months’ rent at $1,500 per month equals $4,500.

52. Accordingly, under G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover at least three months’ rent ($4,500) as statutory damages, plus costs of the action and such other relief as is just. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 788–89 (1994) (three‑month‑rent minimum damages under §14); *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 851 (affirming recovery of statutory damages for violation of quiet enjoyment).

53. To the extent the Court deems it appropriate and within its discretion, Plaintiff also seeks equitable or declaratory relief recognizing the breach and protecting her right to quiet enjoyment going forward. See generally *Green v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.*, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 446–47 (1999) (declaratory and equitable relief within court’s authority where appropriate to resolve disputes involving ongoing rights).
