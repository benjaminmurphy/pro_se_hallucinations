------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jasmine Reed, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Thomas Blackwood, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, **Jasmine Reed** (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Reed”), is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts. She is a residential tenant at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

2. Defendant, **Thomas Blackwood** (“Defendant” or “Mr. Blackwood”), upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential premises located at **123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103** (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was the person entitled to receive rent and legally responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the Premises, including the electrical systems serving the Plaintiff’s apartment.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14** (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the **Springfield District Court**.

6. Venue is proper in the **Springfield District Court** because the Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield. See **G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2**.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at **123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103** (the “Apartment”).

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is **$1,200.00**, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid, or been ready, willing, and able to pay the rent required under the tenancy.

10. Plaintiff used one of the Apartment’s two bedrooms as a **home office** for her work.

11. Beginning approximately **six weeks** prior to the filing of this Complaint (around mid‑October 2025), one of the Apartment’s bedrooms (the room Plaintiff used as her home office) lost **all electrical service**, including:

   a. Non‑functioning electrical outlets; and  
   b. A non‑functioning overhead light fixture.

12. The remainder of the Apartment continues to have electrical service; the defect is localized to that bedroom’s wiring and electrical circuit.

13. The condition renders the affected bedroom **unusable for normal residential purposes**, including use as a bedroom or office, because there is no safe, functional electricity for lighting, devices, or equipment.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of electricity in that bedroom.

15. In response, Defendant sent an electrician who inspected the wiring and informed Plaintiff and/or Defendant that a **more substantial repair** would be required to fix the problem properly.

16. Defendant has stated that he is “getting quotes” and that repair is “complicated” because of the building’s **old wiring**, but **no effective repair has been completed** as of the date of this Complaint, more than six weeks after the loss of electrical service.

17. During this entire period, the bedroom remained without electrical service, and Plaintiff has been unable to use it for its intended purpose.

18. As a result, Plaintiff’s home office equipment and work materials have been **crammed into the living room**, causing clutter and significantly interfering with Plaintiff’s normal and comfortable use of the Apartment.

19. The loss of electricity has made it impossible for Plaintiff to work from home in the Apartment, forcing her to:

   a. Work from **coffee shops**, purchasing approximately **$15 per day** in coffee and food in order to have a place to sit and work; and  
   b. Maintain a **coworking space membership** costing approximately **$150 per month**.

20. These expenditures were reasonably foreseeable and a direct result of the loss of electricity in the bedroom that Plaintiff had been using as her home office.

21. The absence of electricity in one of two bedrooms **substantially and materially deprives** Plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of a significant portion of the Apartment, effectively reducing the functional living space and destroying the utility of that room.

22. Electricity and proper wiring are essential services and conditions that a reasonable tenant would expect to be maintained in a habitable residential apartment. See **Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)** (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and minimum standards of fitness for occupancy).

23. Defendant, as landlord, is obligated under **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and Massachusetts common law to ensure that the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is not substantially interfered with, including by failure to correct serious defects in utilities essential to the use of the premises. See **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)**.

24. Defendant has had **reasonable notice and opportunity** to remedy the electrical defect but has failed to complete the repairs in a timely manner.

25. Defendant’s failure to correct the defective electrical condition constitutes a **substantial interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

26. Plaintiff has suffered **actual damages** as a result of this interference, including:

   a. Loss of the use of one bedroom/home office for more than six weeks;  
   b. Out‑of‑pocket costs for coffee shop workdays (approximately **$15/day** over several weeks);  
   c. Coworking membership fees of approximately **$150/month**; and  
   d. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment due to overcrowding and disruption of normal living activities.

27. Based on these losses and the substantial interference with her tenancy, Plaintiff estimates her damages at **no less than $900.00**, exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees (to the extent available by statute).

28. The Defendant’s failure to remedy the electrical defect is not an isolated or momentary inconvenience but has persisted for an extended period, materially affecting Plaintiff’s use of the Premises and her ability to reside and work there in a safe and comfortable manner.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

29. Plaintiff repeats and re‑alleges Paragraphs 1–28 as if fully set forth herein.

30. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” A landlord who does so is liable for **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

31. Massachusetts courts have held that a **substantial interference** with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, whether or not the landlord acts with malicious intent. See **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 717–19 (1977)**; **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982)**.

32. A landlord’s **failure to maintain essential services** and building systems (including proper electrical service) in a way that substantially interferes with a tenant’s use of the premises can constitute a violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**. See, e.g.:

   - **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)** (landlord liable where actions or inactions set in motion a chain of events resulting in interference with tenants’ quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)** (landlord’s failure to correct serious housing defects and water problems violated covenant of quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982)** (per curiam) (affirming liability for breach of quiet enjoyment where landlord failed to address serious conditions);  
   - **Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997)** (interpreting § 14 and landlord’s statutory liability for interference with tenant’s rights).

33. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every Massachusetts residential lease and tenancy‑at‑will, and may also be expressly stated. See **Eaton v. Federal Nat’l Mortgage Ass’n, 462 Mass. 569, 587–88 (2012)** (recognizing quiet enjoyment as a fundamental incident of possession); **Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929)**.

34. Housing and sanitary codes form part of the standard of habitability and are relevant in evaluating whether quiet enjoyment has been breached. See **Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)**; see also **G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L** (state sanitary code).

35. Pursuant to **105 CMR 410.351, 410.251, and related provisions** of the State Sanitary Code (promulgated under G.L. c. 111, § 127A), landlords are required to maintain safe and functional electrical systems and provide adequate lighting and outlets in habitable rooms.

36. Defendant’s failure to correct the loss of electricity in one of the Apartment’s two bedrooms for more than six weeks is a **serious and substantial condition** that interferes with Plaintiff’s normal living and working activities and with the intended residential use of that room.

37. Defendant’s inaction and delay, after having notice of the defect and of the substantial impact on Plaintiff’s use of the Apartment, is **unreasonable** and constitutes an **indirect interference** with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

38. Massachusetts courts have found violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where landlords fail to address significant building or utility defects after notice. See, e.g.:

   - **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994)** (recognizing substantial interference with tenant’s use as basis for § 14 relief);  
   - **Doe v. Boston Hous. Auth., 404 Mass. 117 (1989)**;  
   - **Williams v. Parkell, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 953 (1990)** (upholding damages under § 14 where landlord failed to remedy conditions).

39. Defendant’s failure to promptly restore electricity to the bedroom, after being informed of the problem and after an electrician confirmed that significant repair was needed, constitutes **more than mere negligence**; it is an ongoing course of conduct that foreseeably and substantially impairs Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

40. Plaintiff has suffered **actual and consequential damages** as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, including:

   a. Loss of use of one bedroom/home office for at least six weeks;  
   b. Increased costs for alternate work locations (coffee shops and coworking space);  
   c. Loss of enjoyment and comfort of the Apartment due to overcrowding and disruption; and  
   d. Emotional distress and inconvenience associated with being unable to work in her own home and having significantly diminished functional living space.

41. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater**, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, so three months’ rent equals **$3,600.00**.

42. Plaintiff seeks damages in an amount permitted by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, including but not limited to **three months’ rent ($3,600.00)** or her actual and consequential damages (which she presently estimates to be at least **$900.00**), whichever is greater, together with costs and such additional relief as this Court deems just and proper.

43. Plaintiff also seeks appropriate **equitable and injunctive relief**, including an order requiring Defendant to promptly and properly repair the electrical system to restore safe and functional electricity to the affected bedroom, to the extent such relief is within this Court’s power in conjunction with the statutory claim. See, e.g., **Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234, 244–45 (1974)** (recognizing broad equitable authority in landlord‑tenant contexts).
