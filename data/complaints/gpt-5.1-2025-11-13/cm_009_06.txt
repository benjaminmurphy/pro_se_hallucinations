Docket No.: ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28 / G.L. c. 209C, § 20 – Legal and Physical Custody / Parenting Time)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson (“Mother”), self‑represented, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Adams (date of birth omitted here for privacy).

2. The Defendant, Michael Adams (“Father”), is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, believed to be currently residing on Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Mother’s residence and the child’s school.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   a. Emily Adams, age 8.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (as applicable to modifications of custody and parenting time), and pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3, as this Court entered the original custody and parenting-time judgment on April 15, 2019.

5. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because it is the court that issued the existing custody and parenting‑time order, and because the minor child resides within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 223, § 1.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about April 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary Orders later incorporated into a Judgment) regarding legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor child (the “2019 Judgment”).

7. The 2019 Judgment provides, in substance, that:  
   a. The Mother has primary physical custody of Emily Adams; and  
   b. The Father has parenting time every other weekend; and  
   c. The Father has one midweek overnight each week, on Wednesday night, with the child returning to school Thursday morning.

8. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, both parents lived in the same town, and the Father’s residence was approximately a five‑minute drive from the child’s school, such that the Wednesday overnight caused minimal disruption to the child’s school schedule, sleep, and general welfare.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, and without a corresponding adjustment to the parenting‑time schedule, the Father has moved from the parties’ former town to a residence on Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Mother’s residence and the child’s school.

10. Despite this substantial increase in distance and travel time, the Father has insisted on continuing to exercise the same Wednesday overnight parenting time as if he still lived five minutes from the child’s school.

11. On Wednesdays, the Father now picks up the child at or after school, drives approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence on Cape Cod, and then awakens the child at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday morning in order to drive her back roughly ninety (90) miles for school that same day.

12. As a result of this extended round‑trip travel of approximately 180 miles in less than 24 hours, the child is chronically sleep‑deprived and exhausted on Thursday mornings and throughout the day on Thursdays.

13. The child’s teacher has reported to the Mother that the child’s participation, alertness, and academic engagement have noticeably dropped on Thursdays, and that the child appears tired and less able to focus compared to other school days.

14. The child herself has communicated to the Mother that the very early wake‑up time, the long car ride, and the resulting fatigue make her school day on Thursdays significantly more difficult.

15. The Wednesday overnight, in light of the Father’s relocation and the new 90‑mile distance, has become unduly burdensome to the child, disrupts her sleep and school routine, and is contrary to her best interests.

16. The Father’s relocation to Cape Cod, combined with his continued insistence on midweek overnights that require a pre‑dawn departure and lengthy commute on a school morning, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2019 Judgment.

17. This material change affects the child’s day‑to‑day welfare, including her sleep, school performance, and overall well‑being, thereby satisfying the “material and substantial change in circumstances” standard for modification under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Mazzone v. Mazzone*, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 32 (2009).

### V. APPLICABLE LAW

18. The Court may modify a judgment regarding custody and parenting time when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

19. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a change in a parent’s residence, especially one that substantially alters the child’s daily routine and affects school performance or stability, can constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification of a parenting‑time schedule. See, e.g.:  
   a. *Mazzone v. Mazzone*, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 32 (2009) (material change and best‑interest analysis required for modification of visitation where circumstances differ from those existing at time of prior judgment);  
   b. *Pierce v. Pierce*, 455 Mass. 286 (2009) (modification appropriate where material change affects child’s well‑being);  
   c. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests of the child are paramount in custody and parenting‑time determinations);  
   d. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (emphasizing continuity and child’s emotional and developmental needs in best‑interest analysis);  
   e. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (relocation and resulting impact on child and parenting time central to best‑interest analysis);  
   f. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (modification appropriate when existing order no longer serves child’s best interests);  
   g. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (courts must focus on the practical impact of parental arrangements on the child’s daily life);  
   h. *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (acknowledging that significant changes in circumstances, including residential moves, may warrant modification of parenting arrangements);  
   i. *Schelling v. Lindell*, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (2006) (superior court may adjust parenting schedule to better align with stability and consistency for child);  
   j. *R.H. v. B.F.*, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (1995) (courts may adjust parenting time where existing schedule proves detrimental to child’s welfare).

20. Massachusetts courts apply the “best interests of the child” standard as the “touchstone” in custody and parenting‑time matters. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595.

21. In determining the child’s best interests, the Court may consider, among other factors, the child’s age and developmental needs, emotional ties with each parent, the child’s school performance, the length of commute associated with parenting time, and the degree of stability and predictability in the child’s routine. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

22. G.L. c. 208, § 31 and related caselaw recognize that a child’s schedule and the impact of parental arrangements on the child’s education and health are central components of the best‑interests analysis. See *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983); *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, a midweek overnight was reasonable because the Father lived only a short drive (approximately five minutes) from the child’s school, and the child’s sleep and school attendance were not disrupted.

24. Circumstances have changed significantly: the Father now resides approximately ninety (90) miles away, resulting in a roughly 180‑mile round trip for the child in less than one day whenever the Wednesday overnight is exercised.

25. To arrive at school on time Thursday morning, the Father wakes the child at approximately 4:30 a.m., depriving her of adequate sleep and leaving her physically and mentally exhausted.

26. The child’s teacher has informed the Mother that the child appears tired on Thursdays, participates less, and seems less engaged and focused than on other days of the week, indicating that the child’s academic performance and school experience are being negatively affected by the current Wednesday‑overnight arrangement.

27. The child has expressed that the long car rides late at night and very early in the morning make her feel tired and upset, and that she finds Thursdays to be “hard days” at school.

28. The current schedule also increases the risk of fatigue‑related safety concerns due to substantial early‑morning driving and travel before dawn during certain times of the year.

29. This pattern of sleep disruption, decreased school participation, and chronic Thursday fatigue is not sustainable and is contrary to the child’s physical health, emotional well‑being, and educational development.

30. Maintaining a more stable, predictable, and age‑appropriate weekday routine is in Emily’s best interests, particularly at her current school‑age stage of development.

31. By eliminating the Wednesday overnight and re‑structuring the Father’s parenting time to avoid long midweek drives on school nights, the child will enjoy more consistent sleep, improved school participation, and a more stable weekly routine, all of which are consistent with the statutory and common‑law emphasis on the child’s welfare. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840–41; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 261–62.

32. The Mother is not seeking to eliminate or unreasonably restrict the Father’s meaningful relationship with Emily, but only to modify the schedule so that the Father’s parenting time does not require a 4:30 a.m. departure and lengthy commute on school mornings.

33. Reasonable adjustments to weekends and non‑school‑day time will preserve and support the Father‑child relationship while protecting the child from unnecessary fatigue and educational disruption, thereby serving the child’s best interests.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

34. The Mother requests that the Court find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2019 Judgment as a result of the Father’s relocation and the resulting detrimental impact of the midweek overnight on the child’s sleep and school performance.

35. The Mother further requests that the Court find that modifying the parenting‑time schedule as described below is in the best interests of the minor child.

36. Specifically, the Mother respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the 2019 Judgment as follows:

   a. The Father’s current midweek overnight parenting time on Wednesday nights shall be eliminated, so that Emily will remain with the Mother on all school nights, absent further order of the Court or written agreement of the parties approved by the Court.

   b. The Father shall continue to have parenting time on alternate weekends, but the pickup and drop‑off times may be adjusted, if necessary, to minimize late‑night or very early morning travel, and to avoid unnecessary fatigue for the child.

   c. To the extent feasible and in the child’s best interests, the Father may receive additional parenting time during non‑school days, school vacations, and/or summer periods to preserve and promote his relationship with Emily, in a manner that does not require long‑distance travel on school nights.

   d. The parties shall cooperate in good faith regarding transportation arrangements to minimize the child’s travel burden and to ensure her timely attendance at school and activities, consistent with her health, safety, and emotional well‑being.

   e. All provisions of the 2019 Judgment not inconsistent with the modification ordered by the Court shall remain in full force and effect.

37. The Mother also requests such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child and to reflect the reality of the Father’s relocation and the child’s current needs.

### VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2019 custody and parenting‑time judgment, including but not limited to the Father’s relocation approximately ninety (90) miles away and the impact of the continued Wednesday overnight on the child’s sleep and school performance;

2. Find that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Adams, to eliminate the Father’s midweek Wednesday‑overnight parenting time so that the child is not required to wake at approximately 4:30 a.m. and travel approximately ninety (90) miles to school on Thursday mornings;

3. Modify the 2019 Judgment to eliminate the Father’s Wednesday‑overnight parenting time and to confirm that all school‑night overnights shall be with the Mother, absent further order of the Court;

4. Adjust the Father’s weekend and/or vacation parenting time, as appropriate, to maintain a meaningful parental relationship while avoiding long‑distance travel on school nights, and to ensure the schedule supports the child’s health, education, and emotional development;

5. Order that all provisions of the 2019 Judgment not modified by the Court shall remain in full force and effect; and

6. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

Sarah Thompson  
Plaintiff, Pro Se
