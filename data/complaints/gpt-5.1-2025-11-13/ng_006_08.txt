------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff Jordan Miller (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Alex Chen (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Miller is an individual residing in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a bicyclist lawfully operating a bicycle on a public way in the City of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Alex Chen is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was operating and/or in control of a motor vehicle being used for rideshare purposes within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including at the time and place of the incident described herein.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to G.L. c. 223A, §§ 2–3 because Defendant is domiciled in Massachusetts or, alternatively, because Defendant committed a tortious act within the Commonwealth causing injury in Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the cause of action arose in Suffolk County, specifically at or near 200 Park Drive, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, and Plaintiff resides in Suffolk County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about July 15, 2023, at approximately [time unknown to Plaintiff], Plaintiff was riding a bicycle in Boston, Massachusetts, traveling on Park Drive in a marked and designated bicycle lane near or in front of 200 Park Drive, Boston, MA 02215.

7. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating the bicycle in a safe, prudent, and lawful manner, following traffic rules, remaining within the marked bike lane, and wearing a protective helmet, consistent with the duties of ordinary care recognized by Massachusetts law. See generally *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (discussing reasonable care standard).

8. At the same date, time, and location, Defendant was operating or had recently operated a motor vehicle as a rideshare driver, and had parked or stopped that vehicle in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the bike lane in which Plaintiff was traveling.

9. Defendant’s vehicle was positioned such that the driver’s side door, if opened, would extend into or immediately across the marked bicycle lane.

10. While Plaintiff was approaching and then passing Defendant’s vehicle in the bicycle lane, Defendant, without first checking his side mirror, without looking over his shoulder, and without ascertaining whether any bicyclists or other road users were approaching from the rear, suddenly swung the driver’s side door open into the lane of travel.

11. Defendant opened the door abruptly and forcefully, causing it to extend directly into Plaintiff’s path of travel in the marked bicycle lane, leaving Plaintiff with no time or space to safely avoid the collision.

12. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to stop, swerve, or otherwise avoid the door because Defendant opened it immediately and without warning at the precise moment Plaintiff was passing.

13. Plaintiff’s bicycle collided with the edge of Defendant’s suddenly opened door. As a result of the impact, Plaintiff was thrown from the bicycle and violently propelled onto the pavement.

14. Plaintiff struck the ground and suffered injuries including but not limited to road rash and abrasions to Plaintiff’s arms and legs, and a chipped front tooth, and Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and damaged.

15. At the scene, Defendant admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone, thereby acknowledging that he was not paying attention to traffic conditions, including bicyclists, before opening his door.

16. Defendant’s admission that he was “checking his phone” at or immediately before opening the driver’s side door demonstrates that Defendant was distracted and failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, in violation of the duty to keep a proper lookout and to refrain from unsafe opening of vehicle doors. See, e.g., *Gauvin v. Clark*, 404 Mass. 450, 454 (1989) (duty of reasonable care).

17. Subsequently, when Plaintiff submitted a claim to Defendant’s automobile insurer, the insurer reported that Defendant alleged that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

18. Plaintiff denies that allegation as false. At all times relevant, Plaintiff remained within the boundaries of the marked bicycle lane and operated in a straight, predictable manner consistent with applicable traffic rules and the standard of reasonable care.

19. Plaintiff did not weave in and out of traffic, did not leave the bike lane, and did not act in any manner that was unsafe or contributed to the collision.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries and property damage, incurred medical expenses, and suffered lost wages and other damages.

21. Plaintiff’s injuries included painful road rash and abrasions on both arms and legs, a chipped front tooth requiring dental treatment, and associated pain, suffering, and emotional distress.

22. Plaintiff reasonably and necessarily sought medical care and dental treatment for the injuries sustained in the collision, including treatment to repair and restore the chipped front tooth.

23. Plaintiff’s medical and dental bills related to this incident total approximately $1,200.

24. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and rendered unsafe to ride, requiring Plaintiff to purchase a replacement bicycle.

25. Plaintiff incurred property damage losses in an amount to be proven at trial, and was required to expend funds to repair or replace the bicycle and related equipment.

26. As a result of the injuries, Plaintiff missed work and lost approximately $600 in wages and/or income.

27. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, inconvenience, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the injuries caused by Defendant’s conduct.

28. At all times relevant, Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for Plaintiff’s own safety and complied with pertinent traffic rules, including Massachusetts laws granting bicyclists the right to use public ways and requiring motorists and occupants of vehicles to exercise due care to avoid collisions. See G.L. c. 85, § 11B(1) (bicyclists’ rights and duties similar to drivers of vehicles); *Mass. Gen. Hosp. v. Grassi*, 356 Mass. 1, 4 (1969) (duty of ordinary care).

29. Defendant, as the driver and/or person in control of a motor vehicle, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, including a duty to maintain a proper lookout for bicyclists and other roadway users, and a duty not to open a vehicle door into moving traffic or a marked bicycle lane unless and until it was reasonably safe to do so.

30. Defendant breached these duties by, among other things: (a) failing to look in the side mirror or over his shoulder before opening his door; (b) opening his door directly into a marked bicycle lane; (c) failing to yield to a bicyclist with the right of way in the bike lane; (d) being distracted by checking his phone instead of paying attention to his surroundings; and (e) failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under like circumstances.

31. The opening of a vehicle door into a lane of travel without first ascertaining that it is reasonably safe to do so has long been recognized as negligent conduct under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., *O’Hara v. Holy Cross Hospital, Inc.*, 305 Mass. 186, 187–88 (1940) (duty to look before entering traffic); *Kaufman v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co.*, 272 Mass. 305, 308–09 (1930) (duty to avoid creating sudden obstruction to others lawfully using way).

32. Defendant’s breach of his duty of care was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. But for Defendant’s negligent conduct in opening his door into the bike lane while distracted and without checking for approaching bicyclists, the collision and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries would not have occurred. See *Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law on causation); *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (proximate cause).

33. Plaintiff’s damages were a foreseeable and natural consequence of Defendant’s negligence. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position would have foreseen that carelessly opening a vehicle door into a bike lane while checking a phone could cause a bicyclist to collide with the door and fall, resulting in bodily injury and property damage. See *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (foreseeability).

34. To the extent that Defendant or his insurer asserts that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies any such negligence. In any event, under the comparative negligence statute, any alleged negligence of Plaintiff that is not greater than that of Defendant would merely diminish, and not bar, Plaintiff’s recovery. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Zinck v. Gateway Country Store, Inc.*, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 573–74 (2008).

35. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent, if any, to bringing this action.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(NEGLIGENCE)

36. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully set forth herein.

37. Under Massachusetts law, negligence is the failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); *Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.*, 389 Mass. 47, 56 (1983).

38. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care arising from the circumstances, including but not limited to:

   a. A duty to operate and control his vehicle, including its doors, in a reasonably safe manner and consistent with Massachusetts traffic laws and common-law principles of due care;

   b. A duty to keep a proper lookout and to observe bicyclists, pedestrians, and other roadway users before opening his vehicle door into a lane of travel;

   c. A duty to refrain from opening a vehicle door into a marked bicycle lane or into the path of an oncoming bicyclist when it is unsafe to do so;

   d. A duty to refrain from distractions, including using or checking a phone, when that distraction would prevent him from safely opening his door and observing conditions around the vehicle.

39. Massachusetts law recognizes that motorists and those in control of vehicles must exercise care for the safety of bicyclists lawfully using the roadway. See G.L. c. 85, § 11B; *Pike v. Guarino*, 488 F.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2007) (applying Massachusetts negligence law to roadway users); *White v. City of Boston*, 363 Mass. 680, 685 (1973) (duty to maintain reasonably safe conditions for lawful roadway users).

40. Defendant breached his duty of care by, without limitation:

   a. Opening his vehicle door into the marked bicycle lane without first checking for oncoming bicyclists;

   b. Failing to look in his mirror or over his shoulder prior to opening the door;

   c. Being distracted by checking his phone instead of paying attention to his surroundings;

   d. Failing to yield to Plaintiff, who was lawfully and foreseeably traveling in the bicycle lane;

   e. Failing to exercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person in like circumstances would exercise.

41. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above constitute negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Gauvin v. Clark*, 404 Mass. 450, 454 (1989) (elements of negligence); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146–47.

42. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. at 794–95; *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 547–48 (1982).

43. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries including, but not limited to, road rash and abrasions on the arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and attendant pain, suffering, and emotional distress.

44. Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200 for treatment arising from the incident, and may incur additional medical or dental expenses in the future.

45. Plaintiff suffered a loss of earnings and/or wages in the approximate amount of $600 due to time missed from work as a result of the injuries.

46. Plaintiff incurred property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle, which sustained a bent and damaged frame requiring repair or replacement, and Plaintiff was required to purchase a new bicycle. The amount of such property damage will be established at trial.

47. Plaintiff also sustained non-economic damages, including physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, all directly resulting from Defendant’s negligent conduct. See G.L. c. 231, § 60H (recognizing tort damages for pain and suffering).

48. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s recovery should not be barred unless Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, is found to be greater than Defendant’s. Plaintiff denies any negligence and asserts that Defendant’s negligence was the primary and substantial cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.

49. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant all damages allowed under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and other compensable losses.

### V. DAMAGES

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:

   a. Bodily injury, including road rash and abrasions to arms and legs;

   b. Dental injury, including a chipped front tooth requiring professional dental care;

   c. Medical and dental expenses of approximately $1,200, and potentially additional reasonable and necessary expenses in the future;

   d. Lost wages of approximately $600, together with any additional lost income and/or diminished earning capacity that may be proven at trial;

   e. Property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle and associated equipment, in an amount to be determined at trial;

   f. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life.

51. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury, but reasonably believed to exceed the minimum jurisdictional threshold of this Court.

52. Plaintiff also seeks statutory interest and costs as provided by G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C, and applicable Massachusetts law, as well as such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND

53. Pursuant to Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 38 and G.L. c. 231, § 60, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but in any event within the jurisdiction of this Court, for:

   1. Past and future medical and dental expenses, including approximately $1,200 incurred to date;  
   2. Past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $600 incurred to date;
