  Plaintiff,  

v.  

DANIEL THOMPSON,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. She is the biological mother of the minor child, Emily Thompson (date of birth omitted for privacy; age 12).

2. The Defendant, Daniel Thompson, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. He is the biological father of the minor child, Emily Thompson.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, and 31A, and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions of G.L. c. 209B.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On or about May 15, 2018, the Norfolk Probate and Family Court entered a judgment and/or order (the “2018 Order”) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time regarding the minor child, Emily Thompson.

5. The 2018 Order provided for joint legal custody and 50/50 shared physical custody of Emily, with a “week on/week off” schedule, alternating weekly between Mother’s home and Father’s home.

6. At the time the 2018 Order entered, both parties resided in reasonably close proximity to one another, were in good health, and were physically able to meet the minor child’s day‑to‑day needs and to respond quickly to any safety concerns.

7. For several years following entry of the 2018 Order, the shared parenting arrangement functioned well. Emily adjusted to the week‑on/week‑off schedule, developed stable routines in both homes, and the parties were able to cooperate sufficiently in carrying out the parenting plan.

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify custody and parenting time under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 31, as the original judgment was issued by this Court and the child has resided in Massachusetts at all relevant times.

9. Venue in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 6 and G.L. c. 215, § 3, because the original judgment entered in this Court and the parties and minor child reside within its jurisdiction.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2018 Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s welfare, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, including but not limited to Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and Ireland v. Ireland, 428 Mass. 822 (1999).

11. Specifically, Daniel Thompson has recently been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition. This medical condition directly impacts his physical mobility, balance, and ability to respond quickly to emergencies or safety‑sensitive situations involving the minor child.

12. Upon information and belief, Daniel’s condition has resulted in multiple falls at home. These falls have sometimes occurred when he is alone and, at other times, when the minor child is present.

13. Daniel’s medical provider has advised him that he should not be alone with the minor child in situations involving stairs, transitions that require significant physical support, or any circumstances that may require a rapid physical response to protect the child from harm.

14. Despite these medical limitations and safety recommendations, Daniel has insisted upon maintaining the same 50/50 week‑on/week‑off physical custody schedule as set forth in the 2018 Order.

15. During Daniel’s parenting time, he has, on multiple occasions, relied on the parties’ twelve‑year‑old daughter, Emily, to assist him with physical tasks, including but not limited to: helping him move from a wheelchair to his bed, retrieving items that he cannot safely access, and otherwise engaging in caregiving duties beyond what is appropriate or safe for a child of her age.

16. Emily has expressed concern and anxiety about being responsible for assisting her father physically, and she has been placed in situations where she fears for his safety and her own, particularly when navigating stairs or when Daniel has difficulty maintaining balance.

17. The progressive nature of Daniel’s neurological condition, together with the increased risk of falls and reduced capacity to respond quickly to emergencies, create an ongoing safety concern for the minor child during unsupervised and extended parenting time that was not present when the 2018 Order was entered.

18. The current 50/50 physical custody schedule, in light of these developments, no longer reflects the circumstances under which the 2018 Order was fashioned and no longer adequately protects the best interests and welfare of the minor child as required by G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 31.

19. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

20. The onset and progression of a serious medical condition that affects a parent’s ability to safely care for a child has been recognized under Massachusetts law as a legitimate basis to revisit custody and parenting time in order to serve the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (emphasizing that the child’s best interests remain paramount and can require adjustment when a parent’s circumstances change); Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 595 (1981).

21. The Supreme Judicial Court has repeatedly held that the “best interests of the child” are the overriding consideration in all custody determinations, and that the Court must consider the child’s welfare in light of current circumstances, not merely those existing at the time of the original judgment. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998); Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007).

22. It is not in the minor child’s best interests to be placed in situations where she is expected to provide physical assistance or caregiving to a disabled parent in a manner that is unsafe, developmentally inappropriate, or emotionally burdensome, particularly where less risky and more stable arrangements are available.

23. As a result of Daniel’s neurological condition and the associated risks, the minor child’s physical safety, emotional wellbeing, and sense of security are compromised under the current equal‑time schedule.

24. Mother is physically capable, willing, and able to provide a safe, stable, and consistent primary residence for Emily, with the structure and supervision needed for a twelve‑year‑old child.

25. A modification of the existing custody and parenting time order is therefore warranted, in that:  
   a. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2018 Order, namely Daniel’s progressive neurological condition and associated limitations; and  
   b. It is in Emily’s best interests that the custody and parenting time arrangement be modified so that she resides primarily with Mother, with parenting time for Father tailored to his current health and safety capabilities.

### V. APPLICABLE LAW

26. G.L. c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Court to make “from time to time, as circumstances require,” orders relative to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children and to revise and alter such orders as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.

27. G.L. c. 208, § 31 provides that in making orders regarding custody, the rights of the parents shall be considered in conjunction with, and subordinated to, the best interests of the child, and that the Court shall “presume that it is in the best interests of the child to have frequent and continuing contact with both parents,” so long as such contact is consistent with the child’s welfare.

28. Under Massachusetts case law, modification of custody and parenting orders requires a demonstration of “a material and substantial change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment” and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:  
   a. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 593–94 (1996);  
   b. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998);  
   c. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981);  
   d. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 540–41 (2010);  
   e. Ireland v. Ireland, 428 Mass. 822, 828–29 (1999);  
   f. Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710–12 (1985);  
   g. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–45 (2003);  
   h. Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 595, 601–04 (1981);  
   i. Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998);  
   j. Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575, 579–82 (2007).

29. The Court has broad equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6 to fashion orders necessary to protect the best interests of the minor child and to ensure her safety, stability, and welfare.

30. The requested modification is consistent with these statutes and precedents and seeks only to adjust physical custody and parenting time to reflect Daniel’s current capabilities and Emily’s safety needs, while preserving and encouraging an ongoing, meaningful relationship between Emily and Daniel to the extent that it can be done safely.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

31. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Order to designate her as the primary physical custodial parent of Emily, with the child’s primary residence to be with Mother.

32. Mother is not, at this time, seeking a change in legal custody and requests that joint legal custody remain in place, provided that the parties can continue to communicate about major decisions affecting Emily’s education, medical care, and general welfare. If joint decision‑making becomes impracticable, Mother reserves the right to seek further modification.

33. Mother requests that Daniel’s parenting time be restructured to reflect his current medical limitations, with the goals of:  
   a. Ensuring the child’s physical safety and emotional wellbeing;  
   b. Reducing or eliminating situations in which the child is expected to perform physically demanding caregiving tasks; and  
   c. Maintaining frequent and meaningful contact between Emily and Daniel in a safe, age‑appropriate manner.

34. By way of example, and subject to the Court’s findings and any medical evidence presented, Mother requests that the Court consider ordering:  
   a. That Emily reside primarily with Mother during the school week;  
   b. That Father have parenting time on a schedule that may include alternating weekends and/or mid‑week visits, day visits, or other periods that do not require Emily to assume physical caregiving responsibilities;  
   c. That any parenting time involving potential physical risk (such as use of stairs or transfers that require significant physical assistance) be structured so that another responsible adult is present to assist Daniel, if feasible; and  
   d. That the parties be permitted to adjust the parenting schedule by mutual written agreement, with the child’s safety to be the paramount consideration.

35. Mother further requests that the Court incorporate into any modified order appropriate provisions for communication between the parties and between Emily and each parent, including reasonable telephone, electronic, or virtual contact, so long as such contact remains safe and appropriate.

36. Mother also requests any other provisions the Court deems necessary to protect Emily’s wellbeing in light of Daniel’s medical condition, including but not limited to:  
   a. Authority for either party to obtain and exchange relevant medical information and documentation concerning Daniel’s physical limitations that bear directly on the child’s safety;  
   b. Requirements that each parent promptly inform the other of any changes in health status or living conditions that materially affect the child’s safety or care; and  
   c. Such additional safeguards as may be recommended by any guardian ad litem, court clinician, or medical provider whose testimony or report the Court may consider.

### VII. NO OTHER PENDING ACTION

37. There is no other pending action between the parties in any court involving custody or parenting time for the minor child, to the best of Mother’s knowledge, information, and belief.

### VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody and parenting time order, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the cases cited herein;

B. Find and rule that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Thompson, that the existing 50/50 week‑on/week‑off physical custody arrangement be modified;

C. Modify the 2018 Order to grant Mother primary physical custody of Emily, with the child’s primary residence to be with Mother;

D. Maintain joint legal custody of Emily in both parents, unless and until further order of the Court, subject to the parties’ ability to effectively share decision‑making in the child’s best interests;

E. Establish an appropriate and safe parenting time schedule for Father, Daniel Thompson, that takes account of his progressive neurological condition and any associated physical limitations, and that ensures Emily is not placed in unsafe or developmentally inappropriate caregiving roles;

F. Include in any modified judgment such additional terms and conditions as the Court deems just, proper, and in Emily’s best interests, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and the decisions of the Massachusetts appellate courts;

G. Award such further relief as this Court deems just and proper in order to protect the health, safety, stability, and best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,  

RACHEL THOMPSON
