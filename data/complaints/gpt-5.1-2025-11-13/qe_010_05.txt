### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Maria Johnson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 81 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852.

2. Defendant Maria Johnson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns and/or manages the residential rental property located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852, where Plaintiff resides as a tenant.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186, including § 14.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under the common and statutory law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Lowell Division of the District Court Department because the leased premises are located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2; G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852 (the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has resided continuously at the Premises from on or about June 1, 2021, through the present date.

9. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, which she has paid or been ready, willing, and able to pay in accordance with the tenancy agreement.

10. The Premises includes a bathroom that does not have a window and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation.

11. Several months into Plaintiff’s tenancy, mold began to grow in the bathroom, initially appearing in the corner of the shower.

12. Over time, the mold growth spread beyond the shower area and onto the bathroom ceiling.

13. The mold growth in the bathroom is visible and substantial and is inconsistent with safe, sanitary residential conditions.

14. Plaintiff has regularly used the bathroom exhaust fan when showering, and she takes normal, reasonable showers; she does not engage in any unusual or extreme use of the bathroom that would justify or excuse the excessive mold growth.

15. After observing the mold, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the condition and requested that Defendant address the problem.

16. Defendant came to the Premises to view the mold but blamed Plaintiff, asserting that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and took showers that were “too hot and too long.”

17. Defendant has refused to take appropriate steps to remedy the underlying moisture and ventilation issues in the bathroom, and has stated that she would only clean the existing mold and would not improve or repair the ventilation or otherwise address the cause of the mold condition.

18. The bathroom’s lack of a window and sole reliance on an exhaust fan that appears inadequate for the level of humidity and moisture in the space make the bathroom especially prone to mold and dampness if not properly designed, maintained, and ventilated by the landlord.

19. The presence and spread of mold in the bathroom have rendered the bathroom unhealthy and have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to safely and comfortably use that portion of the Premises.

20. Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which she did not experience prior to the mold condition.

21. Plaintiff consulted a physician regarding these symptoms. Her doctor advised that the respiratory issues were likely related to the mold exposure in the bathroom and recommended that the mold be properly remediated.

22. Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property that became moldy, including a shower curtain and towels, with a replacement cost of approximately $60.

23. Plaintiff has been compelled to alter the way she uses the bathroom, including limiting showers and attempting to clean and manage the mold herself, causing significant inconvenience, stress, and discomfort.

24. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the continuing mold problem and its effect on her health and living conditions and again requested that Defendant properly remediate the mold and correct the underlying condition, including the ventilation.

25. Despite such notice, Defendant has failed and refused to make adequate repairs or improvements necessary to eliminate the mold and correct the underlying moisture/ventilation problems.

26. Defendant’s response has been to blame Plaintiff’s normal use of the bathroom, rather than to fulfill Defendant’s obligations as landlord to maintain the Premises in a condition fit for human habitation and free from conditions that substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

27. As a result of Defendant’s failure to address the mold and underlying conditions, Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises—especially the bathroom—has been substantially and unreasonably interfered with.

28. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure to appropriately remedy it have caused Plaintiff physical discomfort, exacerbated respiratory problems, emotional distress, anxiety about her health and safety, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.

29. Plaintiff reasonably believes that the continued presence of mold in the bathroom presents an ongoing risk to her health and safety and significantly diminishes the value and habitability of her tenancy.

30. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $600 in damages, including consequential and emotional distress damages, as well as property loss and impairment of her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

## IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

31. Massachusetts law implies in every residential lease a covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides in pertinent part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

32. G.L. c. 186, § 14 further provides that a landlord who substantially interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

33. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from serious interferences with the tenancy, including conditions that materially affect the health, safety, or comfort of the tenant, even where the landlord’s interference is the result of neglect or inaction. See, e.g.:

   a. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where conduct created or permitted conditions that substantially interfered with tenants’ quiet enjoyment, even without intent to disturb);

   b. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (repeated flooding and failure to remedy conditions constituted breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; emotional distress damages recoverable);

   c. **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord’s failure to remedy serious code violations may constitute a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14);

   d. **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment covers substantial interference with use and enjoyment of leased premises);

   e. **Darmetko v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 378 Mass. 758 (1979) (landlord liability for interference with quiet enjoyment arising from conditions within landlord’s control).

34. Conditions that pose threats to a tenant’s health or safety can constitute a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See **Brown v. LeClair**, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985) (respiratory and other health impacts and code violations supported finding of breach); **Miller v. Prescott**, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 312 (1999) (unsanitary and unsafe conditions may support quiet enjoyment claim).

35. A landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for failing to take reasonable steps to correct conditions within the landlord’s control that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises. See **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (failure to address serious defects and water intrusion impacting habitability supported § 14 liability).

36. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is distinct from, but consistent with, the landlord’s obligations regarding habitability and compliance with the State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.). See **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (landlord’s warranty of habitability; substantial violations of the sanitary code may constitute breach of obligations to tenant).

37. The State Sanitary Code requires that dwelling units be kept in a condition that is safe, clean, and sanitary, and free from conditions which may endanger or materially impair the health or safety of occupants, including chronic dampness and mold-like conditions. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including 105 C.M.R. 410.482 and 410.500 (requiring adequate ventilation and safe, sanitary conditions); see also **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord liable for failing to maintain premises in compliance with sanitary code).

38. When a landlord, after notice, fails to take reasonable steps to address an unhealthy or unsafe condition such as chronic mold growth interfering with the tenant’s use of essential areas (such as the bathroom), that failure can constitute a substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Doe v. Boston Housing Auth.**, 414 Mass. 1 (1992) (landlord may be liable under § 14 if it knew or should have known of conditions substantially interfering with tenants’ use and failed to act reasonably).

39. Although negligence is not required for a claim under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord’s unreasonable refusal to take corrective action after notice of a serious problem strongly supports a finding of substantial interference. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

40. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and, where applicable, attorney’s fees.

## V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### Count I – Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

41. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful tenant of the Premises, and Defendant was the landlord, owing Plaintiff the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment as set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14.

43. Defendant was responsible for maintaining the Premises, including the bathroom, in a condition that did not substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a residence.

44. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the mold condition in the bathroom and the underlying ventilation and moisture problems giving rise to that condition, as Plaintiff reported the issue to Defendant and Defendant personally inspected the bathroom.

45. Despite notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable and effective steps to remediate the mold and correct the underlying cause (including inadequate ventilation) and instead blamed Plaintiff’s normal, ordinary use of the bathroom.

46. The persistent mold condition, combined with Defendant’s failure to properly correct it and the underlying cause, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, particularly her ability to safely and comfortably use the bathroom.

47. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure to correct it impaired the health, comfort, and safety of Plaintiff and diminished the character and value of the tenancy.

48. Plaintiff’s respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, are reasonably attributable, in whole or in part, to the mold condition in the bathroom, as confirmed by her treating physician’s assessment that the mold is likely related to her symptoms.

49. Plaintiff also suffered property damage (including having to discard a shower curtain and towels worth approximately $60), emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home as a result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions.

50. Defendant’s actions and inactions, taken together, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, as interpreted by the Massachusetts courts, including but not limited to Blackett, Simon, Al‑Ziab, Doe, Darmetko, Brown, Miller, Jablonski, Berman, and Hemingway.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Health-related harms and physical discomfort caused or exacerbated by exposure to mold;

   b. Emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of peace of mind related to unsafe and unsanitary living conditions;

   c. Loss of and damage to personal property (towels, shower curtain, and related items) in the amount of approximately $60;

   d. Loss of full use and enjoyment of the bathroom and overall Premises, and diminishment in the value of the tenancy.

52. Plaintiff estimates that the total of her actual and consequential damages is at least $600.

53. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and, where applicable, reasonable attorney’s fees. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200; three months’ rent is $3,600, which exceeds the $600 in estimated actual damages.

54. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks statutory damages of three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, or such other measure as the Court deems just and appropriate.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Maria Johnson, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, by substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises through the existence of persistent mold and failure to remedy the underlying conditions;

B. An award of damages to Plaintiff pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount equal to the greater of:

D. An award of costs of this action to Plaintiff, as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff later secures counsel and incurs such fees;

F. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper, including, if within the Court’s power in this action, appropriate orders requiring Defendant to remediate the mold condition and correct the underlying ventilation/moisture problem in a code‑compliant and safe manner.
