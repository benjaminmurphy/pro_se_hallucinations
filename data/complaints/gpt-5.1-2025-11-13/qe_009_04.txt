COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SPRINGFIELD DISTRICT COURT  
HAMPDEN COUNTY
------------------------------------------------------  
JESSICA GREENE,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                     Civil Action No. __________  

MARK THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
------------------------------------------------------

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Greene (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Greene”), is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and landlord of the residential premises located at 456 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises from a residential tenancy in Springfield, Massachusetts and from Defendant’s breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and related statutes because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.

5. Venue is proper in the Springfield District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 8 because the Premises are located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this venue.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two-bedroom apartment located at 456 Maple Street, Springfield, MA (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment as a tenant from January 15, 2022 through the present.

8. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant for the Apartment.

9. The Apartment consists of two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and other common spaces. Plaintiff uses one of the bedrooms as a sleeping area and the other as a home office.

10. For approximately the last six weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint, one of the two bedrooms (the “Office Bedroom”) has had no functioning electricity.

11. Specifically, in the Office Bedroom, the electrical outlets do not work and the overhead light is inoperable.

12. The remainder of the Apartment has electricity, but the Office Bedroom has been entirely without electrical service.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical failure in the Office Bedroom after it began.

14. In response, Defendant sent an electrician to inspect the problem.

15. The electrician informed Plaintiff and/or Defendant that the condition in the Office Bedroom required a more substantial electrical repair, due in part to the building’s older wiring.

16. Despite being informed that the problem required a “bigger repair,” Defendant has not completed the necessary work to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom.

17. Defendant has told Plaintiff that he is “getting quotes” and that the repair is “complicated” because of the building’s age and wiring, but Defendant has failed to take timely and effective action to correct the condition.

18. As of the date of this Complaint, the Office Bedroom remains without electricity and cannot be used in a normal, safe, or reasonable manner.

19. Prior to the loss of electricity, Plaintiff used the Office Bedroom as a home office.

20. Due to the lack of electricity in the Office Bedroom, Plaintiff has been forced to move her office furniture, equipment, and work materials into the living room and to work elsewhere outside the Apartment.

21. The relocation of Plaintiff’s office materials into the living room has cluttered and crowded the primary living space, significantly reducing Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Apartment as a whole.

22. Because the Office Bedroom is unusable as an office and lacks basic electrical service, Plaintiff has been compelled to work from coffee shops, where she typically spends approximately $15 per day on coffee and food in order to have a place to sit and work.

23. Plaintiff has also incurred additional expenses by purchasing and maintaining a coworking space membership at approximately $150 per month to have a functional work environment, which she reasonably expected to have within the Apartment.

24. Plaintiff’s loss of the use of one of the two bedrooms, and the associated disruption and expenses, has materially and substantially interfered with her use and enjoyment of the Premises.

25. As a result of Defendant’s failure to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom within a reasonable time, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use of a significant portion of the Apartment, emotional distress, inconvenience, and out-of-pocket financial damages.

26. Plaintiff estimates that, based on the problems and the period of time she has been deprived of the use of the Office Bedroom and the Apartment as a whole, she has suffered damages of at least seven hundred and twenty dollars ($720.00), and reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial.

27. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid or tendered the rent lawfully due, or stands ready, willing, and able to do so, and has not engaged in conduct that would justify Defendant’s failure to remedy the condition.

28. Defendant’s failure to timely and effectively repair the electrical system serving the Office Bedroom constitutes a substantial and ongoing deprivation of services that are necessary to Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

29. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–28 as if fully set forth herein.

30. Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

31. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease and tenancy, whether oral or written. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

32. A landlord’s failure to correct conditions that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises, when the landlord has notice and a reasonable opportunity to repair, can constitute an unlawful interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 283–84 (1994).

33. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, an “act or omission” by the landlord that results in an interruption of “services” to which the tenant is entitled can be a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may entitle the tenant to recover actual or statutory damages. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–76 (1994); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

34. The provision of safe, functional electrical service to a bedroom in a residential apartment is a basic service essential to the normal, safe, and reasonable use of the premises, and its prolonged interruption constitutes a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See generally Hemingway v. O’Brien, 363 Mass. 359, 368–71 (1973) (recognizing landlord’s obligations regarding habitability and essential services); G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A, 127L (minimum standards of fitness for human habitation).

35. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., requires that a dwelling unit be provided with adequate and safe electricity and lighting, including outlets and fixtures, in every habitable room. See, e.g., 105 C.M.R. 410.250–410.260 (lighting and electrical facilities).

36. Defendant’s failure, over a period of approximately six weeks or more, to restore electricity to one of the two bedrooms in the Apartment, after having actual notice of the condition and of the need for a “bigger repair,” constitutes an “omission” that resulted in an interruption of services to which Plaintiff is entitled within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

37. The lack of electricity in the Office Bedroom has rendered that room effectively unusable and has materially impaired the value, safety, and habitability of the Apartment, thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Darmetko, 378 Mass. at 761–62.

38. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been continuous and substantial, as Plaintiff has lost the use of one of her two bedrooms and has been compelled to incur extra expenses and to rearrange her living space in ways that significantly detract from the normal enjoyment of her home. See Al Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (quiet enjoyment breach may be found where conditions significantly impair use and enjoyment); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 402–03 (1982).

39. Defendant had both the right and the practical ability to undertake and complete the repairs necessary to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom, and his failure to do so within a reasonable time was unreasonable and without legal justification. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Doe, 417 Mass. at 283–84.

40. Plaintiff’s damages resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment include, but are not limited to:

   a. Loss of use of one of the Apartment’s two bedrooms for at least six weeks, and continuing until repairs are completed;

   b. Out-of-pocket costs for working in coffee shops, estimated at approximately $15 per day during the period of non-use;

   c. Costs of a coworking space membership of approximately $150 per month;

   d. Loss of use and enjoyment of the living room and other areas of the Apartment due to crowding and displacement of office materials;

   e. Inconvenience, disruption of daily life, and emotional distress attributable to the prolonged deprivation of full use of the Premises.

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who violates the tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee,” even if the tenant is self‑represented. See Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 774–76; Wolfberg, 385 Mass. at 402–04.

42. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and such further relief as this Court deems just and proper. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also Simon, 385 Mass. at 110–11 (affirming multiple damages and costs under § 14).

43. Plaintiff currently estimates her actual damages at not less than $720.00, representing loss of use, out‑of‑pocket expenses, and related consequential harm, and seeks such amount or the statutory minimum provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, whichever is greater, as determined by the Court.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Greene, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Mark Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by failing to timely and adequately restore electrical service to one of the bedrooms in Plaintiff’s Apartment;

B. An award of monetary damages to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than Seven Hundred Twenty Dollars ($720.00), or three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, whichever is greater;

C. An order that Defendant promptly and properly restore full and lawful electrical service to the affected bedroom and otherwise correct all conditions that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises;

D. An award of costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E. Any other and further relief that this Court deems just and proper.
