BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  

------------------------------------------------------  
Jessica Thompson,  
 Plaintiff / Petitioner,  

v.                                                     Docket No. ___________

Michael Brown,  
 Defendant / Respondent.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Michael Brown (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emily Brown (date of birth: __________, age 10) and Noah Brown (date of birth: __________, age 8) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Brown, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court (“this Court”) pursuant to G.L. c. 215 and G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related provisions governing custody and support of minor children.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

4. On or about April 12, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order regarding custody and parenting time (the “2022 Custody Order”) concerning the Children.

5. Under the 2022 Custody Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Children. The 2022 Custody Order further provides that:

   a. The Children reside primarily with the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, who has primary physical custody; and  

   b. The Defendant, Michael Brown, has parenting time with the Children on a regular schedule, including weekends; and  

   c. The parties are to support the Children’s relationship with each parent, and are prohibited from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the Children or undermining the Children’s relationship with the other parent.

6. This Court retained continuing jurisdiction over issues of custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the Court’s general equity powers under G.L. c. 215.

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because:

   a. The prior custody order was issued by this Court;  

   b. The Plaintiff, the Defendant, and the Children reside in Bristol County, Massachusetts; and  

   c. The Children have lived in Massachusetts for more than six months preceding the filing of this Complaint, making Massachusetts their home state under G.L. c. 209B (Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act).

8. This Complaint is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, which permits modification of custody and parenting-time provisions upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the requested modification is in the best interests of the Children. See also G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (modification of custody orders concerning children born out of wedlock, to the extent applicable).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2022 Custody Order on April 12, 2022, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the Children, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions.

10. Over the past approximately twelve (12) months, the Defendant has repeatedly and unilaterally enrolled the Children in extracurricular activities, commitments, and events that are scheduled during the Plaintiff’s court-ordered parenting time, including on Plaintiff’s designated weekends, without first obtaining the Plaintiff’s consent or engaging in good‑faith joint decision-making.

11. In doing so, the Defendant has acted inconsistently with the spirit and letter of joint legal custody, which requires meaningful consultation and shared decision-making on major issues in the Children’s lives, including significant educational and extracurricular commitments. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (defining joint legal custody as shared responsibility and mutual consultation on major decisions).

12. After unilaterally signing the Children up for such activities, the Defendant has told the Children that it is the Plaintiff’s “fault” if they are unable to attend those activities while the Children are in the Plaintiff’s care on her scheduled weekends, thereby placing the Children in the middle of parental conflict and causing emotional distress.

13. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant has called the Plaintiff “selfish” and has told the Children that the Plaintiff “does not really love them” when she requests to adjust or swap weekends in order to accommodate the Children’s needs or family scheduling issues.

14. These disparaging comments about the Plaintiff, made by the Defendant directly to the Children, violate the 2022 Custody Order’s explicit requirement that both parents support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparaging or undermining the other parent in the Children’s presence.

15. The Defendant’s repeated disparagement of the Plaintiff to the Children, and his conduct of blaming the Plaintiff for schedule conflicts created by his own unilateral decisions, have caused emotional strain on the Children, including but not limited to:

   a. One of the Children, in particular, has begun experiencing stomach aches and physical distress on “transition days” when exchanges between households occur;  

   b. The Children have expressed confusion, anxiety, and guilt about attending activities, visiting with each parent, and their perceived “loyalty” to each parent; and  

   c. The Children’s sense of stability and security has been negatively affected.

16. The Children’s physical symptoms (stomach aches on transition days) and their emotional distress constitute a substantial change in circumstances since the 2022 Custody Order was issued, indicating that the current implementation of joint legal custody and the current parenting-time structure are no longer serving their best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests focus on emotional security and stability); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (court must consider emotional impact and stability in custody determinations).

17. The Defendant’s conduct demonstrates a pattern of:

   a. Failing to communicate and cooperate with the Plaintiff regarding significant scheduling and extracurricular decisions;  

   b. Prioritizing unilateral choices over joint legal custody; and  

   c. Undermining the Children’s relationship with the Plaintiff and creating loyalty conflicts.

18. Under Massachusetts law, when parents are unable or unwilling to communicate and cooperate effectively in making major decisions for their children, joint legal custody may no longer be in the children’s best interests. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (joint legal custody inappropriate where parents lack capacity for cooperative decision‑making).

19. The Defendant’s persistent disparagement of the Plaintiff to the Children and his interference with the Children’s relationship with the Plaintiff are relevant and weighty factors in determining the best interests of the Children. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (ability of parent to foster child’s relationship with other parent is critical factor); Custody of Dougherty, 429 Mass. 620 (1999) (same); Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (court considers whether a parent is likely to encourage child’s relationship with the other parent).

20. The 2022 Custody Order was entered based upon an expectation that both parents would:

   a. Support the Children’s relationship with the other parent;  

   b. Refrain from disparaging each other in the presence of the Children;  

   c. Communicate in good faith regarding the Children’s schedules and activities; and  

   d. Exercise joint legal custody by engaging in shared decision‑making on significant matters.

21. The Defendant’s actions, as described above, constitute a significant and ongoing departure from those expectations and from the assumptions underlying the 2022 Custody Order.

22. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” and when modification is in the “best interests of the children.” See also Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (modification standard focuses on material and substantial change and best interests); Jacobs v. Jacobs, 403 Mass. 71 (1988) (same).

23. The repeated unilateral scheduling of activities during the Plaintiff’s parenting time, coupled with the Defendant’s disparagement of the Plaintiff to the Children, his blaming the Plaintiff for the Children’s missed activities, and the resulting physical and emotional distress in the Children, collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2022 Custody Order.

24. Massachusetts courts have recognized that when a parent’s conduct interferes with the children’s relationship with the other parent, fails to support that relationship, or exposes the children to ongoing conflict and disparagement, modification of custody and parenting arrangements may be necessary to protect the children’s best interests. See, e.g.:

   a. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   b. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   c. Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000) (parent’s interference with other parent‑child relationship is relevant to custody);  
   d. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998) (court considers a parent’s willingness to support relationship with the other parent).

25. The current joint legal custody arrangement and existing parenting‑time structure are no longer workable and are not serving the Children’s best interests in light of:

   a. The breakdown in cooperative decision‑making;  

   b. The Defendant’s ongoing disparagement and blame‑shifting;  

   c. The resultant stress and physical symptoms exhibited by at least one of the Children; and  

   d. The need for clearer, more predictable rules regarding scheduling and significant decisions.

26. It is necessary and appropriate for this Court to modify the 2022 Custody Order to:

   a. Clarify and reinforce the Plaintiff’s role as the primary residential parent;  

   b. Ensure that the Children’s day‑to‑day stability and routines are protected;  

   c. Clarify decision‑making authority over the scheduling of extracurricular activities and events; and  

   d. Protect the Children from being exposed to disparaging remarks and loyalty conflicts.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

27. The paramount consideration in any custody and parenting‑time determination is the best interests of the Children. G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

28. In determining the best interests of the Children, the Court considers, among other factors:

   a. The Children’s emotional, physical, and developmental needs;  

   b. The capacity of each parent to meet those needs and provide a stable and nurturing environment;  

   c. The ability of each parent to foster and encourage the Children’s relationship with the other parent;  

   d. The level of conflict or cooperation between the parents; and  

   e. The practical realities of each parent’s ability to make and implement decisions in the Children’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843‑845; Custody of Vaughan, 422 Mass. at 595‑597.

29. The Plaintiff has been the Children’s primary residential parent and has consistently provided a stable, nurturing home in which the Children live most of the time, in accordance with the 2022 Custody Order.

30. The Plaintiff has endeavored to comply with the requirements of the 2022 Custody Order, including supporting the Children’s relationship with the Defendant and attempting to coordinate schedules and parenting time in a manner that serves the Children’s best interests.

31. The requested modification will not sever or unreasonably restrict the Children’s relationship with the Defendant, but will instead:

   a. Preserve the Plaintiff’s primary physical custody;  

   b. Maintain reasonable and consistent parenting time for the Defendant;  

   c. Provide clearer, enforceable guidelines about extracurricular scheduling and joint decision‑making; and  

   d. Reduce the Children’s exposure to conflict and disparaging discussions about either parent.

32. Clarifying that the Children’s primary residence shall remain with the Plaintiff, and that scheduling of significant recurring activities will require advance consultation and agreement, will promote stability and predictability for the Children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the principles articulated in Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

33. The requested modifications are narrowly tailored to address the issues that have arisen since the 2022 Custody Order and are designed to protect the Children’s emotional well‑being and physical health, consistent with Massachusetts law prioritizing the best interests and welfare of minor children.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

34. The Plaintiff seeks a modification of the 2022 Custody Order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law (including, but not limited to, Custody of Kali, Custody of Vaughn, Schuler v. Schuler, Jacobs v. Jacobs, and Rolde v. Rolde), on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the Children.

35. Specifically, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

   a. Confirm that the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, shall have primary physical custody of the Children, Emily (age 10) and Noah (age 8), with the Children’s primary residence to be with the Plaintiff;  

   b. Modify the existing parenting‑time schedule, as necessary, to reduce conflict and provide a clear, consistent schedule for the Children’s time with the Defendant, including weekend parenting time for the Defendant that does not conflict with the Children’s reasonably planned and agreed‑upon activities;  

   c. Clarify joint legal custody such that:  

      i. All major decisions concerning the Children’s health, education, and significant extracurricular activities must be made jointly, following reasonable and timely consultation between the parties; and  

      ii. Neither parent may unilaterally enroll the Children in recurring extracurricular activities or commitments that materially interfere with the other parent’s established parenting time without the prior written consent (including email or text confirmation) of the other parent or further order of the Court;  

   d. Include explicit provisions that:  

      i. Each parent shall refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children;  

      ii. Each parent shall refrain from discussing adult disputes, fault, or blame regarding missed activities or scheduling conflicts with the Children; and  

      iii. Each parent shall actively support and encourage the Children’s relationship with the other parent, including by avoiding statements that suggest the other parent is “selfish,” “does not really love” the Children, or is otherwise unloving or uncaring;  

   e. Provide that, in the event of future disputes about scheduling of major extracurricular activities, the Plaintiff, as the primary residential parent, shall have final decision‑making authority after good‑faith consultation with the Defendant, subject to the Defendant’s right to seek further order or review from the Court;  

   f. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the Children’s best interests, including, if necessary, orders for co‑parenting communication guidelines, use of a parenting communication application, or participation in parenting education consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and applicable court rules.

### VII. COMPLIANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS LAW AND CASES (SUMMARY OF AUTHORITIES)

36. This Complaint is grounded in and brought pursuant to the following Massachusetts statutes and cases, among others:
