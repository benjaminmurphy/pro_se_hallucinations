    Plaintiff,  

v.

CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Monroe (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Samuel Larkin (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Monroe is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been a residential tenant of Defendant at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Samuel Larkin is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. The Boston Housing Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3, 5, because this is a civil action arising out of and affecting a residential tenancy located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Suffolk County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 185C, § 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 15, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a studio apartment at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, owned and/or managed by Defendant.

7. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,450, which Plaintiff has paid or has been ready, willing, and able to pay under the terms of the lease and applicable law.

8. During the initial showing of the apartment, prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the unit and specifically asked Defendant about them.

9. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed,” thereby assuring Plaintiff that the condition was historical and not an ongoing water‐intrusion problem.

10. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s statements in deciding to enter into the tenancy and rent the Premises.

11. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, during the first significant rainstorm after the start of her tenancy, water began actively dripping from the ceiling in the same area where the water stains were visible.

12. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak, informing him that water was entering the apartment and that the ceiling was actively dripping.

13. On multiple occasions thereafter, during subsequent rainstorms over the course of the tenancy, water continued to leak from the ceiling of the apartment.

14. Plaintiff repeatedly complained to Defendant about the recurring leak, the water intrusion, and the impact on her ability to use and enjoy the apartment.

15. Despite these complaints, Defendant dismissed the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and told Plaintiff that she knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease, effectively refusing to make necessary and timely repairs.

16. The leak is not merely cosmetic; it is an active, recurring water intrusion that has damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, created unsanitary and unhealthy conditions, and interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s use of her home.

17. During at least one significant storm, the water leak became severe enough that water from the ceiling soaked Plaintiff’s couch and a laptop left on her coffee table.

18. As a direct result of the leak, Plaintiff’s laptop was irreparably damaged and had to be replaced, at a cost of approximately $900.

19. Over time, the recurring water intrusion has resulted in a persistent musty odor in the apartment, consistent with dampness and possible mold or mildew growth.

20. Since the onset of the leaking and the musty conditions, Plaintiff has experienced headaches that she reasonably believes are related to mold or other unhealthy conditions arising from chronic moisture.

21. Out of concern for her health and safety and to minimize damage to her belongings, Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed and arrange her furniture away from the affected ceiling area.

22. Because of the leaking and resulting conditions, Plaintiff can no longer comfortably or safely use the entire apartment and has effectively been forced to live in only a portion—approximately “half” of the studio—thereby reducing the usable living space for which she pays full rent.

23. Defendant has failed and refused to take adequate steps to properly repair the roof or ceiling, to eliminate the water intrusion, or to remediate any mold, despite repeated notice and opportunity to cure.

24. Defendant’s failure to address the ongoing water intrusion and unsanitary conditions is not a one‐time occurrence but has continued for months, over multiple storms, after Plaintiff’s complaints.

25. Defendant’s acts and omissions are not trivial or technical; they are serious, recurring, and have a direct, harmful impact on Plaintiff’s ability to peacefully and beneficially enjoy her tenancy.

26. The conditions created and allowed to persist by Defendant—recurring leaks, water damage, musty odor, and suspected mold—constitute conditions that endanger or materially impair the health, safety, and well‐being of Plaintiff and materially interfere with her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered property damage (including, but not limited to, the destroyed laptop), loss of usable living space, discomfort, inconvenience, and potential adverse health effects, and has been deprived of the full benefit of the rent she pays.

28. Plaintiff estimates her out‐of‐pocket property damage at approximately $900, in addition to her loss of use and enjoyment of the apartment and other consequential harms.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

29. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully set forth herein.

30. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises.

31. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in pertinent part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

32. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants against serious interferences with the use and enjoyment of their home resulting from the acts or omissions of the landlord or those under the landlord’s control. See *Davis v. Comerford*, 483 Mass. 164 (2019); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

33. A landlord’s failure to remedy known defective and unhealthy conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s habitation can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, even in the absence of an intent to harm. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994).

34. The existence of conditions that “endanger or materially impair” a tenant’s health or safety, and a landlord’s failure, after notice, to take reasonable steps to correct those conditions, constitutes an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Doyle v. Commonwealth*, 434 Mass. 686, 692–94 (2001); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

35. Repeated water leaks, water damage, and associated mold or musty conditions are recognized as serious defects affecting the habitability and quiet enjoyment of residential premises. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 198–201 (1979); *Hemingway v. Enterprise Realty Co.*, 363 Mass. 184, 191–93 (1973).

36. Defendant had actual notice of the water‐intrusion problem both before Plaintiff moved in (as demonstrated by the pre‑existing water stains) and repeatedly afterward, through Plaintiff’s oral and/or written complaints following each rainstorm.

37. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take adequate, timely, and effective steps to repair the roof and ceiling, to stop the water intrusion, or to remediate any resulting mold or unhealthy conditions.

38. Defendant’s failure to repair, and his repeated characterization of the leaking as a mere “minor cosmetic issue,” constitute a willful, knowing, and/or at least negligent disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and safety, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

39. As in *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), where persistent flooding and water problems caused by the landlord’s failure to repair were held to breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Defendant’s ongoing failure to correct the water leaks and resulting unsanitary conditions here constitutes a substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

40. Defendant’s conduct also violates the public policy embodied in the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., which requires that every dwelling be maintained in a safe, sanitary, and habitable condition, including requirements regarding watertight roofs, protection from moisture, and prevention of conditions that may cause mold or mildew. See 105 C.M.R. 410.500 (structural and moisture standards).

41. While a violation of the State Sanitary Code is not, by itself, the cause of action here, such violations are evidence of a material interference with habitability and quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. at 200–01; *Davis v. Comerford*, 483 Mass. at 169–70.

42. The defect and its consequences are not de minimis; they affect the essential functions of housing—safety, sanitation, and use of the space. Plaintiff is deprived of the full use of her studio, must rearrange her living space to avoid leaks, and is exposed to unhealthy conditions.

43. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is both substantial and ongoing. The leak has persisted through multiple storms, over a lengthy period, and continues to affect Plaintiff’s daily life.

44. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Property damage, including the destruction of her laptop (approximately $900);  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a significant portion of the apartment;  
   c. Discomfort, inconvenience, and disruption of daily living;  
   d. Exposure to unhealthy conditions, including musty, mold‐suspect air and resulting symptoms such as headaches.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment is strictly liable for at least three months’ rent or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 103; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

46. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,450; three months’ rent therefore equals $4,350. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to property damage, diminution of use of the apartment, and related harms, are at least $900 and, when combined with statutory entitlements, justify an award of not less than three months’ rent as provided by statute.

47. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant the greater of (a) three months’ rent ($4,350) or (b) her actual and consequential damages, together with costs and such reasonable attorney’s fees as the Court deems appropriate under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 790–91; *Davis v. Comerford*, 483 Mass. at 171–72.
