Because it is not the controlling opinion and in fact disputes key aspects of the majority\u2019s formulation of an implied warranty of habitability, this passage does not itself establish the proposition that Massachusetts law implies, in every residential lease, both a covenant of quiet enjoyment and a warranty of habitability requiring adequate heat and habitability under the State Sanitary Code.
