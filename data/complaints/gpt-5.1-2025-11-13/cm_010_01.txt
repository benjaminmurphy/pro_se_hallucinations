**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
WESTON DIVISION

**DOCKET NO.:** ____________________  

**SAMANTHA CARTER**,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

**DAVID CARTER**,  
  Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)

Now comes the Plaintiff, **Samantha Carter** (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, **David Carter** (“Father”), and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Samantha Carter, is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, **Emily Carter**, born ____________, 2015 (age 10).

2. The Defendant, David Carter, is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Emily Carter.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of the **Weston Probate and Family Court** (the “Court”) pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this matter concerns custody and parenting time of a minor child who is a resident of the Commonwealth.

4. On or about **May 15, 2018**, this Court entered a **Judgment** (the “2018 Judgment”) governing legal and physical custody and parenting time regarding the minor child, Emily Carter.

5. Under the 2018 Judgment, the Court awarded **primary physical residence** of Emily to Father, with Mother to have **limited weekend parenting time** and **one weeknight dinner visit** each week.

6. The 2018 Judgment and the current parenting schedule were expressly based on Mother’s circumstances at that time, including:

   a. Mother’s enrollment in graduate school;  
   b. Mother’s residence in a **small studio apartment**, which was not well-suited for consistent overnights with a then‑four‑year‑old; and  
   c. Mother’s **inflexible academic and work schedule**, which limited her availability for parenting time.

7. This Complaint for Modification is filed pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the Court’s equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6 to modify the custody and parenting‑time provisions of the 2018 Judgment based upon a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and to serve the **best interests of the child**.

---

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there have been multiple, substantial, and continuing changes in circumstances that affect the welfare and best interests of Emily and that warrant modification of custody and parenting time. See **G.L. c. 208, § 28**; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Pearson v. Pearson*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 156 (2001).

#### A. Mother’s Employment, Housing, and Stability

9. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, Mother was completing graduate school and had a demanding school and work schedule, which significantly limited her ability to exercise expanded parenting time.

10. Mother has since **successfully completed her graduate education**, and now maintains a **stable, full‑time job** with **normal daytime hours**, providing a predictable schedule that allows her to be regularly available for Emily before and after school, in the evenings, and on weekends.

11. Mother’s current employment provides **stable income**, enabling her to consistently meet Emily’s needs (housing, food, clothing, school activities, and medical co‑pays) during her parenting time.

12. Mother has improved her living situation from a studio apartment to a **two‑bedroom apartment** in Massachusetts, where Emily has **her own bedroom** and an age‑appropriate, safe, and nurturing home environment.

13. The improvement in Mother’s work schedule, income, and housing situation constitutes a **substantial and material change** from the circumstances that existed at the time of the 2018 Judgment, directly bearing on her capacity to exercise more parenting time and to share or assume increased physical custody. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

#### B. The Child’s Age, Development, and Relationship with Mother

14. Emily was approximately **four (4) years old** when the 2018 Judgment entered. She is now **ten (10) years old**, in a different developmental stage with evolving emotional, social, and educational needs.

15. As children grow, their needs, schedules, relationships, and capacities to benefit from different parenting arrangements change; this Court recognizes that a prior custody and parenting‑time order may become inappropriate or unworkable over time. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

16. Over the past several years, Emily and Mother have developed a **very close, loving, and secure relationship**. Emily is strongly bonded to Mother, enjoys time in Mother’s home, and is comfortable and happy during her visits.

17. Emily has expressed repeatedly to Mother, and to her therapist, that she **wants more time and more overnights** with Mother.

18. Emily’s current therapist (a licensed mental health professional) has reported that Emily experiences **sadness and guilt** when her time with Mother is brief, and that she feels **distressed having to leave** after short visits.

19. According to the therapist, Emily’s desire for more consistent and extended time with Mother is **genuine**, **age‑appropriate**, and **emotionally significant**, and the therapist has indicated that greater time with Mother would be beneficial to Emily’s emotional well‑being.

20. Emily has **written a letter to the Court** expressing that she wants more overnights and extended parenting time with Mother.

21. While a child’s preference is **not controlling**, Massachusetts courts recognize that a mature child’s genuine and reasonable preference is an important factor in determining best interests, especially where it is consistent with the child’s emotional needs and stability. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

22. Emily’s increased age, maturity, and clearly expressed desire—supported by her therapist—for more time with Mother represent a substantial and material change of circumstances under Massachusetts law.

#### C. Father’s Refusal to Consider Reasonable Adjustments

23. Mother has attempted to discuss reasonable, child‑focused adjustments to the parenting schedule with Father in light of: (a) Mother’s increased stability and availability; and (b) Emily’s growing needs and preferences.

24. Father has **refused to discuss any changes** to the schedule and has become **angry or upset** when Emily raises the subject of wanting more time or overnights with Mother.

25. Emily has reported that Father’s anger or irritation when she mentions wanting more time with Mother causes her added stress and **emotional conflict**, which burdens her relationship with both parents.

26. While Mother does not seek to diminish Father’s role or Emily’s relationship with him, Father’s refusal even to consider reasonable, child‑centered modifications has contributed to tension for Emily and has prevented adjustments that would better serve her best interests.

27. The Court’s primary concern in custody and parenting‑time determinations is the **best interests of the child**. See *G.L. c. 208, § 28*; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996). When one parent’s refusal to adapt to changed circumstances undermines the child’s needs and emotional health, the Court may appropriately modify the parenting plan.

28. Considering all of the above, including Mother’s dramatically improved stability and availability, Emily’s age and emotional needs, and Emily’s consistent wish for more time with Mother, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the 2018 Judgment such that the existing custodial and parenting‑time arrangement is no longer in Emily’s best interests. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Pearson v. Pearson*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 156 (2001); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

---

### III. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

29. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and relevant Massachusetts case law, the Court may modify an existing custody order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances, and (2) that modification is in the **best interests of the child**. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

30. The **best interests** analysis is broad and flexible, encompassing the child’s emotional, physical, and educational needs; the child’s relationship with each parent; the stability of each household; each parent’s capacity to meet the child’s needs; and, where appropriate, the child’s preferences. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

31. Mother is now able to provide Emily with:

   a. A stable residence with a dedicated bedroom and safe, age‑appropriate living environment;  
   b. Consistent supervision and care due to Mother’s normal work hours;  
   c. Emotional support and a nurturing relationship that Emily values deeply; and  
   d. Reliable support for Emily’s schooling, activities, and health‑care needs.

32. Increased time with Mother—whether through expanded parenting time or a reallocation of physical custody—would:

   a. Respect and support Emily’s expressed, consistent desire to spend more time with Mother;  
   b. Reduce Emily’s feelings of guilt and sadness associated with brief visits and abrupt departures; and  
   c. Strengthen Emily’s emotional security by allowing her to maintain meaningful, ongoing contact with both parents in a balanced way.

33. The requested modification is **not punitive** toward Father and does not seek to exclude him; instead, it aims to create a more balanced, developmentally appropriate parenting arrangement that reflects the current realities of both households and Emily’s needs.

34. In light of Mother’s improved circumstances, Emily’s age and stated preference, and the guidance of Emily’s therapist, maintaining the restrictive, 2018 schedule—designed for a four‑year‑old child and a mother in graduate school—is no longer consistent with Emily’s best interests.

35. Under Massachusetts law, the Court has broad equitable authority to enter such custodial and parenting‑time orders as justice and the welfare of the child require. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

### IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

36. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Judgment to reflect the parties’ and the child’s current circumstances and the child’s best interests.

37. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the 2018 Judgment; and  

   b. Enter a modified custody and parenting‑time order that **significantly increases** Emily’s time with Mother, including—but not limited to—one or more of the following forms of relief:

      i. A **shared or modified physical custody arrangement** that allows Emily to spend substantially more overnights with Mother in Mother’s home; and/or  

      ii. A **revised parenting schedule** that includes additional weekends, school‑night overnights, and holiday and vacation time with Mother, consistent with Emily’s schooling and extracurricular activities; and  

      iii. Any other schedule or allocation of parenting time that the Court finds to be in Emily’s **best interests**.

38. Mother further requests that the Court’s modified order:

   a. Confirm that both parents shall support Emily’s relationship with the other parent and shall **refrain from disparaging** the other parent in Emily’s presence; and  

   b. Encourage both parents to consider, in good faith, reasonable adjustments to scheduling that meet Emily’s needs and support her emotional well‑being.

39. Mother also requests that the Court, in its discretion, consider obtaining further information relevant to Emily’s best interests, including but not limited to:

   a. Input from Emily’s therapist (as permitted by the rules of evidence and privilege considerations); and/or  
   b. In‑camera interview or other child‑sensitive procedures, if the Court deems appropriate, consistent with *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and related precedents.
