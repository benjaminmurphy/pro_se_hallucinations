In doing so, it expressly cites prior cases where landlords\u2019 failure to repair code-related defects of which they had notice (e.g., leaky roof, uninhabitable conditions) were deemed violations of \u00a7 14. That reasoning directly supports the proposition that a landlord\u2019s failure to correct serious sanitary code or health/safety conditions after notice can breach quiet enjoyment.",

App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985) (failure to bring apartment into habitable condition and keep it so).

However, the court expressly limits the warranty of habitability to physical conditions and does not tie the quiet\u2011enjoyment analysis to sanitary code violations or to \u2018sanitary code\u2019 conditions as such. The decision is about criminal/drug activity in common areas and the landlord\u2019s failure to act against nontenants, not about failure to correct serious sanitary code violations, so it does not directly support the specific sanitary\u2011code-based proposition stated.",

It holds that Gem\u2019s failure to correct known, unsanitary flooding conditions\u2014despite repeated complaints\u2014made the resulting interference with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment foreseeable and thus actionable, and expressly ties \u00a7 14\u2019s \u201cactual and consequential damages\u201d to all reasonably foreseeable harms. This reasoning supports the idea that a landlord who knows or should know that failing to address severe conditions (like infestations or flooding) will substantially interfere with a tenant\u2019s enjoyment is liable for that interference.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAlthough early cases applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment required intent on the part of the landlord\u2026 more recent decisions have imposed liability whenever the \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of a landlord\u2019s action was interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights\u2026 When the Legislature chose the words \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019\u2026 it must have intended to incorporate these cases into the statute\u2026. The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages\u2026 suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery.\u201d"
