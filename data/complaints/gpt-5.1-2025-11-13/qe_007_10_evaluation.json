Justice Quirico would ground the new rule in an implied agreement that the premises comply with statutory and code standards, and he explicitly recognizes that G.L. c. 111 and the State Sanitary Code impose obligations on landlords for tenants\u2019 benefit. Although he criticizes the majority\u2019s broader \"implied warranty of habitability\" formulation, his concurrence/dissent accepts that tenancies incorporate statutory minimum standards (including quiet enjoyment\u2011type protections) by operation of law; the majority in Hemingway (not quoted here) actually adopts the implied warranty of habitability. Thus, the case as a whole supports the proposition that residential tenancies are subject to a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment and an implied warranty of habitability, though this excerpt itself partly argues for a narrower statutory\u2011based theory.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "As the first step in the removal of the roadblock discussed above I would reverse that rule and hold instead (a) that the various statutes, ordinances, by-laws, rules, regulations and codes prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards, and (b) that by renting such a unit the landlord impliedly agrees with his tenant (i) that at the time of the renting the unit complies with those standards and (ii) that during the term of the renting he will do whatever such legal provisions require him to do for compliance with such standards."
