### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Ethan Johnson (“Plaintiff”), on his own behalf and as parent and next friend of his minor son [INITIALS: J.J.], complains against Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Ethan Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is the father and legal guardian of J.J., a minor child, age eight at the time of the events described herein.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts nonprofit or other organized entity operating a community center and after-school program located at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302.

3. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or was otherwise responsible for the after-school program and gym activities conducted at its facility at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, MA.

4. At all times relevant hereto, the employees, agents, and staff members of Defendant were acting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency with Defendant, and Defendant is vicariously liable for their acts and omissions under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See *Wang Laboratories, Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc.*, 398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986).

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This is a civil action for negligence arising under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

6. Jurisdiction is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department because the causes of action arise from events that occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A.

7. Venue is proper in this Court because the incident giving rise to this claim occurred at Defendant’s premises located at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, MA 02302, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, § 2.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

9. Defendant operates an after-school program for minor children at its facility in Brockton, which includes use of a gymnasium where children play and engage in physical activities.

10. Defendant advertises and represents to parents and guardians, including Plaintiff, that children enrolled in its after-school program will be supervised at all times while in the gym and participating in activities.

11. On or about March 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s minor son, J.J., then eight years old and small for his age, was enrolled in and attending Defendant’s after-school program at 123 Community Center Way, Brockton, MA.

12. On that date, J.J. and approximately twenty (20) other children were present in the gymnasium as part of the after-school program.

13. It was Defendant’s policy and/or practice, and the reasonable standard of care, that at least two staff members be present in the gym to supervise a group of approximately twenty children engaged in physical activity.

14. On March 15, 2023, only one staff member was physically present in the gym supervising the children; the second staff member who was supposed to be present left the gym area to “do paperwork” in the office, leaving the children inadequately supervised.

15. The staff member who remained in the gym was primarily standing near the bleachers and was distracted by and looking at her cell phone instead of actively supervising the children.

16. While the staff member was inattentive, two older, larger boys, approximately twelve years of age, began engaging in a rough, tackle-style game on the hardwood gym floor.

17. This rough play involved physical tackling and created an obvious, foreseeable, and unreasonable risk of physical harm—especially to younger, smaller children like J.J.—if not promptly stopped or controlled by responsible adult supervision.

18. Several children observed the rough tackling and, concerned for safety, complained to the supervising staff member and informed her of the dangerous play.

19. In response, the staff member negligently and dismissively stated “boys will be boys,” and failed to intervene, instruct the older boys to stop, separate them, or otherwise take reasonable steps to protect the younger children.

20. Despite having actual notice of the dangerous conduct, the staff member took no reasonable action to stop or supervise the rough tackling game and continued to fail to monitor the children properly.

21. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to provide adequate supervision and to stop the hazardous rough play, one of the larger boys tackled J.J. forcefully onto the hardwood floor.

22. J.J. struck his head hard on the floor, lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds, and experienced confusion and disorientation upon regaining consciousness.

23. Emergency medical attention was required; J.J. was taken to the emergency room, where he was evaluated and diagnosed with a concussion.

24. J.J. missed several days of school due to his concussion and related symptoms, including headache, confusion, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.

25. As a direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,800 in medical bills for emergency room care, follow-up visits, and related medical treatment for J.J.

26. As a further direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff lost approximately $1,200 in wages because he was required to take time off from work to care for J.J., attend medical appointments, and manage the aftermath of the injury.

27. J.J. has suffered and may continue to suffer pain, discomfort, emotional distress, anxiety, and disruption to his normal life and schooling as a result of the concussion and the circumstances of the injury.

28. Plaintiff has suffered, and may continue to suffer, emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life associated with seeing his child injured and managing the consequences of Defendant’s negligence.

29. Defendant, through its employees and agents, failed to exercise reasonable care in supervising children in the gym and in preventing foreseeable harm, in violation of its duty under Massachusetts law to act as a reasonably prudent operator of a youth facility and after-school program would act under the same or similar circumstances.

---

## IV. CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENCE

30. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

### Duty

31. Under Massachusetts law, a person or entity owes a duty of reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 143–44 (2006); *Hebert v. Enos*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 817, 820–21 (2004).

32. A landowner and operator of a facility such as Defendant owes a duty to lawful visitors, including children in its care, to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe and to protect them against reasonably foreseeable risks of harm. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 742 (1995).

33. An organization that undertakes the supervision and care of children, including an after-school program and community center, owes a heightened duty of reasonable care in supervising those children and protecting them from unreasonable risks of physical harm, including harm from other children’s dangerous conduct that is known or reasonably foreseeable. See *Wallace v. Wilson*, 411 Mass. 8, 12–13 (1991) (duty to protect child from foreseeable harm); *Commonwealth v. Welansky*, 316 Mass. 383, 397 (1944) (duty arises from control of premises and patron safety).

34. Defendant, having voluntarily undertaken to supervise and care for J.J. in its after-school program, owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising him and other children in the gym, in maintaining adequate staffing, and in responding appropriately to known dangerous conduct. See *Cottam v. CVS Pharmacy*, 436 Mass. 316, 321–22 (2002) (duty from voluntary undertaking); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 50–54 (1983) (duty to take reasonable measures to protect students from foreseeable harm).

### Breach

35. Defendant, by and through its employees and agents, breached its duties of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to maintain the required or reasonably necessary number of staff members in the gym to supervise approximately twenty children engaged in physical activity;

   b. Permitting one of the two staff members who was supposed to be supervising to leave the gym for non-emergency “paperwork,” leaving the children inadequately supervised;

   c. Allowing the remaining staff member to be distracted by her cell phone rather than actively supervising the children;

   d. Failing to intervene or stop the rough tackle-style play between older boys on a hard gym floor after being expressly notified by other children of the dangerous behavior;

   e. Dismissing safety concerns with the statement “boys will be boys” and consciously choosing not to act to reduce or eliminate a known risk of harm;

   f. Failing to adopt, follow, or enforce adequate policies and procedures regarding supervision levels, staff attentiveness, and prompt intervention in dangerous play;

   g. Failing to take reasonable precautions to separate older, larger children from younger, smaller children when rough play or tackling was occurring;

   h. Failing to train and supervise staff adequately in child safety, risk recognition, and appropriate responses to dangerous conduct.

36. A reasonably prudent operator of an after-school program and community center in like circumstances would have maintained continuous, attentive supervision; would not have allowed one supervisor to leave; would have promptly stopped the rough play upon notice; and would have implemented and enforced policies to prevent the kind of foreseeable injury that occurred here. See *Mullins*, 389 Mass. at 53–54; *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–48.

37. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care owed under Massachusetts law and constituted negligence. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (negligence is failure to act as an ordinary prudent person under the circumstances); *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267 (1986).

### Foreseeability

38. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that leaving a group of approximately twenty children in a gym with only one inattentive staff member, and permitting older children to engage in rough, tackle-style play on a hard floor, would create a substantial risk of serious physical injury to younger and smaller children.

39. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that, once notified by other children of the rough tackling and dangerous conduct, the failure to intervene or stop the play would likely lead to injury. See *Mullins*, 389 Mass. at 54 (foreseeability of harm where risk is or should be known); *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147.

40. The conduct of the older children in tackling J.J. was a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s failure to supervise and failure to respond to the known dangerous rough play, and does not constitute a superseding cause that would relieve Defendant of liability. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996); *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 445–46 (2007).

### Causation

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, J.J. was tackled by an older, larger child and struck his head on the hardwood floor.

42. As a direct and proximate result of the impact and Defendant’s negligence, J.J. sustained a concussion, loss of consciousness, confusion, and related symptoms, and required emergency medical treatment and follow-up care.

43. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about J.J.’s injuries and the resulting economic and non-economic damages to Plaintiff and his minor child. See *Aspen v. Boston*, 398 Mass. 32, 34 (1986).

### Damages

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff and his minor child have suffered and will continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Medical expenses for emergency room care, diagnostic tests, physician visits, and related treatment for J.J., in an amount currently estimated at approximately $5,800, and such additional medical expenses as may be incurred in the future;

   b. Lost wages and loss of income to Plaintiff, currently estimated at approximately $1,200, resulting from time missed from work to care for his injured child and attend medical appointments;

   c. Pain and suffering experienced by J.J. as a result of the concussion, loss of consciousness, and related symptoms;

   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish suffered by J.J. arising from the incident and its aftermath;

   e. Impairment and disruption of J.J.’s normal life, including missed school days and interference with his education and daily activities;

   f. Emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life suffered by Plaintiff associated with witnessing and dealing with his child’s injury and its consequences;

   g. Costs and inconvenience associated with securing medical care and managing the injury.

45. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for all losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 548–49 (1982); *Dobos v. Driscoll*, 404 Mass. 634, 640–41 (1989).

46. Plaintiff also seeks pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and costs as allowed by law.

---

## V. APPLICABLE STATUTES AND AUTHORITIES (NON-EXHAUSTIVE)

47. This action arises under and is informed by, among others, the following Massachusetts statutes and common-law principles, which Plaintiff cites for notice and support (not as separate causes of action):
