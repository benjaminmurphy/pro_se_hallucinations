**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BRISTOL COUNTY DIVISION  

------------------------------------------------------  
EMILY JOHNSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.                     Docket No. ___________

MICHAEL SMITH,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Emily” or “Plaintiff”), and complains of the Defendant, Michael Smith (“Michael” or “Defendant”), and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children Liam Smith (age 10) and Ava Smith (age 8) (collectively, “the children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the children.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this is a Complaint for Modification of a prior custody and parenting order of this Court concerning minor children who reside in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior Judgment/Order concerning custody and parenting time was issued by this Court and the parties and children reside within this County.

---

### II. PRIOR ORDER

5. On or about May 14, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2021 Custody Order”) establishing legal and physical custody, parenting time, and related provisions concerning the parties’ minor children.

6. Under the 2021 Custody Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the children.

7. Under the 2021 Custody Order, the children primarily reside with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and have a regular parenting schedule with the Defendant, Michael Smith.

8. The 2021 Custody Order further requires each parent to support and encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent and prohibits disparaging or undermining comments about the other parent in the presence of the children.

9. The 2021 Custody Order is a valid, existing order of this Court and remains in full force and effect unless and until modified by further order of this Court.

---

### III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

10. Under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, this Court may modify an existing judgment regarding custody and parenting time upon a showing of (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the children.

11. Massachusetts appellate courts have long held that modification of custody requires a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration. *See, e.g.,*  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015);  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

12. The Court has broad equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6 to fashion orders to protect the best interests and welfare of minor children and to ensure that existing judgments are adapted to present conditions. *See* *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

13. Since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances concerning the children’s welfare and the parties’ ability to effectively exercise shared legal custody and parenting time under the current arrangement.

14. Over approximately the last year, the Defendant, without prior consultation or joint decision-making with the Plaintiff, has repeatedly enrolled the children in extracurricular activities, events, or obligations that occur during the Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time.

15. The Defendant has done so unilaterally, despite the parties’ shared legal custody arrangement, which requires that major decisions affecting the children—particularly recurring extracurricular commitments that impact parenting schedules—be made jointly, or at least after meaningful consultation, in accordance with the spirit of G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant case law such as *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

16. After unilaterally enrolling the children in activities during the Plaintiff’s scheduled weekends, the Defendant has repeatedly told the children, in substance, that if they miss those activities while they are with the Plaintiff, it is the Plaintiff’s fault and not his.

17. The children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant has called the Plaintiff “selfish” and has told them that the Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” when the Plaintiff has requested to swap or adjust weekends to accommodate the children’s schedules in a reasonable way.

18. These comments by the Defendant disparage the Plaintiff to the children, directly contradict the 2021 Custody Order’s non-disparagement and co‑parenting provisions, and are inconsistent with the duty of each parent to foster the children’s relationship with the other parent recognized under Massachusetts law. *See, e.g.,* *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (court may consider one parent’s efforts to undermine the child’s relationship with the other parent); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

19. The children have been emotionally affected by the Defendant’s conduct. One of the children has begun experiencing recurrent stomach aches and physical distress on transition days when moving between households, which the Plaintiff reasonably believes is associated with the emotional tension and pressure they feel about pleasing both parents and “taking sides.”

20. The children’s increased anxiety and physical symptoms around transitions constitute a change in their emotional and physical condition since entry of the 2021 Custody Order and demonstrate that the current implementation of the existing order is negatively impacting their welfare.

21. The Defendant’s pattern of unilateral decision‑making, scheduling children’s activities during the Plaintiff’s parenting time without agreement, and then blaming the Plaintiff to the children for any scheduling conflicts has created ongoing confusion, conflict, and stress for the children.

22. The Defendant’s conduct has effectively undermined the practical functioning of joint legal custody, as the parties are no longer able to consistently make major and recurring decisions together regarding the children’s schedules, in violation of the principles articulated in *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

23. The Defendant’s disparaging comments about the Plaintiff in the presence of the children violate the clear terms and intent of the 2021 Custody Order and are contrary to the children’s best interests, as courts have recognized that a parent’s unwillingness or inability to support the child’s relationship with the other parent is highly relevant in custody determinations. *See* *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

24. Massachusetts courts have emphasized that a child’s best interests are served when parents cooperate, communicate effectively, and refrain from exposing children to conflict and disparagement. *See, e.g.,* *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (best interests standard focuses on child’s welfare, including emotional well‑being); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

25. The Plaintiff has attempted, in good faith, to comply with the spirit and letter of the 2021 Custody Order by maintaining the children’s primary residence with her, following the schedule as best as possible, and seeking reasonable changes or swaps to accommodate the children’s evolving needs and activities.

26. The Defendant’s continuing pattern of unilateral scheduling and disparagement has made adherence to the existing schedule increasingly difficult and has caused the children emotional distress, thereby constituting a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the children’s welfare since May 14, 2021.

27. Under the standards set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 28 and case law such as *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981), these changes in the parties’ ability to co‑parent cooperatively and in the children’s emotional and physical condition warrant a modification of the existing custody and parenting provisions.

---

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

28. The controlling consideration in all custody and parenting matters is the best interests of the children. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

29. The children already reside primarily with the Plaintiff under the 2021 Custody Order, and the Plaintiff provides a stable, consistent home environment that meets their daily physical, educational, and emotional needs.

30. Clarifying and modifying custody to reflect that the children shall continue to reside primarily with the Plaintiff, with a clearly defined and enforceable parenting schedule and explicit rules governing extracurricular scheduling and decision‑making, will promote stability and predictability for the children.

31. A modified order that clearly sets out that:  
   a. The Plaintiff has primary physical custody;  
   b. The parties shall confer and agree in advance regarding enrollment of the children in recurring extracurricular activities, especially where such activities will affect the other parent’s scheduled parenting time; and  
   c. Both parties shall strictly comply with non‑disparagement provisions and actively support the children’s relationship with the other parent;  

   is necessary to protect the children from ongoing conflict and from being placed in the middle of parental disputes.

32. Establishing a more structured parenting plan that protects the Plaintiff’s primary custodial role, while providing the Defendant with appropriate parenting time subject to clear rules about scheduling and communication, will reduce the children’s stress and anxiety, thus serving their best interests in accordance with *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), and *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

33. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant jurisprudence, including *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the Court may consider each parent’s ability and willingness to foster the children’s relationship with the other parent and to place the children’s needs above parental conflict. The Defendant’s repeated disparagement of the Plaintiff to the children and his practice of blaming the Plaintiff for conflicts he created demonstrate a failure in this regard.

34. In light of the above, a modification that formally recognizes the Plaintiff as the children’s primary physical custodian, clarifies and refines the parenting schedule, and imposes specific, enforceable provisions regarding decision‑making, scheduling, and non‑disparagement is in the children’s best interests.

---

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

35. The Plaintiff does not seek to eliminate the Defendant’s relationship with the children, but rather to protect the children’s emotional and physical well‑being by clarifying primary custody, formalizing a parenting plan that reduces conflict, and creating explicit rules for scheduling and parental communication.

36. The Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the 2021 Custody Order as follows (subject to the Court’s discretion and any additional orders deemed necessary):

   **a. Primary Physical Custody**

   37. That the Court enter an order that the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, shall have primary physical custody (primary residence) of the minor children, Liam Smith and Ava Smith, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the existing realities of the children’s living arrangements.

   **b. Legal Custody and Decision‑Making**

   38. That the Court either:  
      (i) reaffirm joint legal custody conditioned upon the parents’ compliance with specific decision‑making and communication protocols set forth below; **or**  
      (ii) if the Court finds that joint legal custody is no longer workable due to the inability of the parties to communicate and cooperate, award sole legal custody to the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, in accordance with the best‑interests analysis under *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), and *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

   39. That, if joint legal custody is maintained, the Court order that:  
      a. The parties shall meaningfully consult with one another and attempt, in good faith, to agree regarding major decisions affecting the children’s education, medical care, mental health, and recurring extracurricular activities;  
      b. Neither parent shall unilaterally enroll the children in any recurring extracurricular activities or ongoing commitments that will regularly interfere with the other parent’s scheduled parenting time without that parent’s written or clearly documented consent; and  
      c. If a dispute arises about extracurricular scheduling, the parties shall first attempt to resolve it through written communication (such as email or a co‑parenting app) before seeking Court intervention.

   **c. Parenting Schedule**

   40. That the Court adopt or clarify a parenting schedule such that:  
      a. The children’s primary residence remains with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson;  
      b. The Defendant, Michael Smith, has parenting time on a regular, specified schedule (for example, alternate weekends and such mid‑week time as the Court deems appropriate), with holiday and vacation schedules to be defined or reaffirmed; and  
      c. Any changes to the parenting schedule shall be made in writing (email or mutually agreed co‑parenting platform), and both parties shall respond to reasonable schedule change requests in a timely and good‑faith manner.

   **d. Extracurricular Activities and Scheduling**

   41. That the Court order that:  
      a. The parties shall, to the extent reasonably possible, schedule the children’s recurring extracurricular activities in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with either parent’s established parenting time;  
      b. In the event the children are already enrolled in activities that overlap with a parent’s time, both parents shall cooperate in good faith to ensure transportation and participation without blaming the other parent for reasonable scheduling conflicts;  
      c. Neither parent shall tell the children that the other parent is “selfish,” “doesn’t love them,” or is otherwise to blame if, after reasonable efforts at coordination, a particular event cannot be attended due to the parenting schedule, and any such issues shall be discussed only between the adults, not with or through the children.

   **e. Non‑Disparagement and Support of Parent‑Child Relationships**

   42. That the Court enter a detailed non‑disparagement order, including:  
      a. Neither parent shall disparage, criticize, or undermine the other parent in the presence or hearing of the children;  
      b. Neither parent shall communicate to the children, directly or indirectly, that the other parent is selfish, does not love them, or is otherwise to blame for reasonable disagreements or schedule changes;  
      c. Each parent shall affirmatively encourage and support the children’s love and affection for the other parent and shall not attempt to influence the children to align with one parent against the other, consistent with *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

   **f. Dispute Resolution and Communication**

   43. That the Court order that all non‑emergency co‑parenting communications regarding schedules, extracurriculars, and non‑urgent matters be conducted in writing (e.g., email or a co‑parenting communication application) to minimize conflict and create a clear record.

   44. That the Court may, in its discretion, order the parties to participate in parent education, co‑parenting counseling, or other services designed to improve communication and cooperation where appropriate.

   **g. Further Relief**

   45. That the Court, pursuant to its broad equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6, grant such additional orders as may be necessary to protect the children’s best interests and to ensure that the modified judgment is workable, clear, and enforceable.

---

### VII. CONCLUSION

46. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2021 Custody Order, including: the Defendant’s unilateral decisions regarding the children’s extracurricular activities; his repeated disparagement of the Plaintiff to the children; and the resulting emotional and physical distress experienced by the children, especially around transition days.

47. These changes have undermined the effective functioning of joint legal custody and the existing parenting schedule and have adversely affected the children’s welfare.

48. A modification clearly designating the Plaintiff as the children’s primary physical custodian, clarifying legal custody and decision‑making, defining and refining the parenting schedule, and imposing explicit rules for scheduling decisions, non‑disparagement, and communication is in the best interests of the children as required by G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the Massachusetts cases cited above.
