In fact, Payton\u2019s main holding is that Massachusetts does NOT allow recovery for negligently inflicted emotional distress in the absence of physical harm, and it only describes recovery for emotional distress with physical injury as traditional background (\u201cparasitic\u201d damages). The case does not create or focus on a rule about loss of enjoyment of life or similar distress when there is an underlying physical injury; rather, it restricts stand\u2011alone emotional distress claims without physical harm.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWhere plaintiffs have suffered directly inflicted personal injuries as a result of a defendant's negligence, courts have not been reluctant to allow recovery for emotional distress, occurring contemporaneously with those personal injuries, as an additional element of damages. \u2026 In these cases, recovery for emotional distress was allowed as a claim \u2018parasitic\u2019 to the \u2018host\u2019 claim of damages for negligently inflicted physical injuries. \u2026 We conclude that when recovery is sought for negligent, rather than intentional or reckless, infliction of emotional distress, evidence must be introduced that the plaintiff has suffered physical harm.\u201d"
