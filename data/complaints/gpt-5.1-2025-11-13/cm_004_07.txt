COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BRISTOL COUNTY DIVISION

SOPHIA REYNOLDS,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL REYNOLDS,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No. __________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Reynolds (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Reynolds.

2. The Defendant, Michael Reynolds, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Ethan Reynolds.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:

   - Ethan Reynolds, age 8 (date of birth intentionally omitted for privacy).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This matter is properly before the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, which previously exercised jurisdiction over custody and parenting time concerning the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C (to the extent applicable).

5. Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the original custody order was entered in this Court and the parties and minor child reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 208, § 6; G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

6. The Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

7. On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody and parenting time judgment (the “2018 Judgment”) regarding the minor child, Ethan Reynolds.

8. Under the 2018 Judgment, Mother was awarded primary physical custody of Ethan. Father was granted limited parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit. The 2018 Judgment expressly provided that Father would not have overnights with the child because, at that time, Father lived only in a single room in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have appropriate or stable sleeping space for a young child.

9. The 2018 Judgment was appropriate at the time it was entered, based on Ethan’s age (approximately three years old) and Father’s then-existing housing conditions, as well as the Court’s obligation to act in the best interests of the child under G.L. c. 208, § 31; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law. See, e.g., Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

11. Ethan is now eight (8) years old and is in school full-time. His developmental needs, school responsibilities, and daily routines are significantly different from when he was three years old. As children grow, their needs naturally evolve, and custody and parenting plans must sometimes be adjusted accordingly. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

12. Father’s living situation has materially improved and is substantially different from what it was in 2018. Father no longer lives in a single room in a shared apartment with roommates. Instead, Father now has his own separate apartment.

13. In Father’s current apartment, Ethan has his own bedroom and a suitable, stable, and age-appropriate place to sleep and keep his belongings during overnight visits with Father.

14. The primary reason the Court originally prohibited overnights with Father was Father’s prior lack of appropriate and independent housing for the child. That condition no longer exists. See, e.g., Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (material change found where parent’s housing and stability improved).

15. The current parenting schedule, which was created for a three-year-old child and a non-overnight situation, now results in Ethan being shuttled back and forth for multiple short visits on school nights. This frequent transportation disrupts his homework, bedtime routines, and overall school-week structure.

16. The existing schedule is exhausting for Ethan and for both parents, and it no longer fits Ethan’s age, school obligations, or emotional needs. See Custody of a Minor, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 780 (1987) (best interests include stability and continuity in the child’s daily life).

17. Ethan has repeatedly expressed a desire to have actual sleepovers at Father’s home. He wants to spend more meaningful, extended time with Father, rather than brief, fragmented visits during the school week.

18. Ethan’s expressed wishes are consistent with his age and maturity and should be considered as one factor in the best-interests analysis, although not controlling. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1034 (1999); Adoption of Xan, 86 Mass. App. Ct. 668 (2014).

19. Both parents recognize that the current structure of frequent short visits with no overnights is no longer appropriate or practical, given Ethan’s age, his school schedule, and Father’s improved circumstances.

20. Mother and Father both agree that the schedule should be modified so that Ethan can have overnights with Father and a more age-appropriate parenting time schedule that better supports Ethan’s school routine, sleep schedule, and emotional well-being.

21. The parties’ joint recognition that modification is appropriate, while not dispositive, supports the conclusion that there has been a material change in circumstances and that a modification is in Ethan’s best interests. See White v. Laingor, 434 Mass. 64 (2001) (court gives weight to cooperative parenting and agreements that promote the child’s best interests).

22. There is no allegation that Father is unfit, and this Complaint for Modification is not based on any claim of misconduct by Father. Rather, it is based on positive changes in Father’s circumstances, the child’s maturation, and the practical impact of the existing schedule on Ethan’s life.

23. Massachusetts law recognizes that when a custodial or parenting time arrangement, though once reasonable, no longer serves the child’s best interests because of changed circumstances, the Court has both the authority and the responsibility to modify the order. G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

24. The requested modification advances the statutory policy in G.L. c. 208, § 31 that children should have “frequent and continuing contact with both parents” where such contact is consistent with the child’s best interests.

25. The combination of (a) Ethan’s age and full-time school attendance, (b) Father’s significantly improved and now appropriate housing, including a separate bedroom for Ethan, (c) the burdensome and disruptive nature of the current three-short-visits-plus-Sunday schedule, and (d) Ethan’s consistent desire for overnights with Father, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

26. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must determine custody and parenting time based on the best interests of the child, considering all relevant factors affecting the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs. See Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

27. A revised parenting schedule that includes regular overnights with Father will provide Ethan with:

   a. More stable and less rushed time with Father, rather than fragmented short visits;  
   b. An opportunity to build and strengthen his relationship with Father through normal daily routines, such as dinner, homework, bedtime, and morning preparation for school; and  
   c. A more age-appropriate structure for an eight-year-old elementary school student.

28. A modified schedule that reduces the number of short weekday transitions will lessen the stress, travel, and disruption to Ethan’s homework and sleep, thus promoting his educational success and emotional stability. See Custody of a Minor, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 780 (1987).

29. Overnights with Father are now safe and appropriate because Father has obtained a suitable, independent residence with a dedicated bedroom for Ethan, thereby addressing the primary concern that led the Court to exclude overnights in the 2018 Judgment.

30. The requested modification will maintain Mother’s role as the primary physical custodian (unless the Court decides otherwise), while expanding Ethan’s parenting time with Father in a way that is balanced, predictable, and consistent with Ethan’s best interests.

31. The proposed modification is consistent with the goal of encouraging cooperative co-parenting and substantial involvement of both parents in the child’s life. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

32. Under the principles articulated in cases such as Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998), and Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001), the combination of a clear material change in circumstances and evidence that modification will benefit the child requires that the existing order be revisited and adjusted.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

33. Mother does not seek to change legal custody at this time, except to the extent the Court deems any clarification necessary. To the extent the 2018 Judgment granted joint legal custody, Mother requests that joint legal custody continue, subject to appropriate co-parenting communication regarding Ethan’s education, medical care, and activities.

34. Mother requests that the Court modify the 2018 Judgment to create a new parenting plan for Father that includes regular overnights and reduces the number of short, disruptive visits during the school week.

35. By way of example and without limiting the Court’s discretion, Mother asks that the Court enter an order substantially as follows, or such other schedule as the Court finds to be in Ethan’s best interests:

   a. Father shall have parenting time with Ethan on alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m.) until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., including overnights on both Friday and Saturday nights;  

   b. In addition, Father shall have one midweek overnight each week during the school year (for example, from after school or 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday until the following morning when Father brings Ethan to school or returns him to Mother at an agreed-upon time);  

   c. During school vacations, summer, and holidays, the parties shall follow a reasonable, age-appropriate shared schedule to be set forth in detail in the modified judgment, providing Ethan with substantial and meaningful time with both parents;  

   d. The order excluding overnights with Father based on his former housing situation shall be vacated in its entirety;  

   e. Exchanges shall occur at the child’s school or at another mutually agreed-upon neutral location to minimize disruption to Ethan.

36. Mother further requests that the Court include in the modified order any standard provisions regarding:

   a. Sharing of information about Ethan’s schooling, medical care, and activities;  
   b. Reasonable notice and cooperation for vacations and special events; and  
   c. Methods of resolving minor scheduling disputes in a child-focused and cooperative manner.

37. The proposed modification is intended solely to better serve Ethan’s needs and schedule, not to diminish Father’s role or Mother’s role, and is consistent with the principle that stable and positive relationships with both parents typically promote a child’s welfare. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).

### VII. COMPLIANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS LAW

38. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and, to the extent applicable, G.L. c. 209C, which authorize the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the child’s best interests.

39. The requested relief is also consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31, which directs the Court to focus on the best interests of the child in allocating legal and physical custody and in setting parenting time.

40. The facts alleged herein demonstrate a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Judgment and establish that modifying the parenting schedule to add overnights with Father and reduce weekday disruptions is in Ethan’s best interests.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody and parenting time judgment;

B. Modify the existing custody and parenting time provisions to:

   1. Maintain, confirm, or clarify legal custody consistent with the Court’s prior intent and the best interests of the child;  
   2. Establish a new parenting schedule for Father providing for regular overnights, including alternating weekend overnights and at least one midweek overnight during the school year, and a reasonable allocation of holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time;  
   3. Vacate the prior prohibition on overnights with Father, in light of Father’s improved and appropriate housing and the child’s current age and needs; and  
   4. Reduce or eliminate the current pattern of multiple short weekday visits that interfere with Ethan’s homework, bedtime, and overall school-week stability;

C. Enter such additional and further orders as are necessary to protect and promote the best interests of the minor child, including standard co-parenting provisions regarding communication, information sharing, and transportation;

D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
SOPHIA REYNOLDS
