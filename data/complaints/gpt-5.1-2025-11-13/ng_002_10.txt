---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Newton Commonwealth Park is a public park located in Newton, Massachusetts, within Middlesex County.

7. At all relevant times, the City of Newton maintained rules and regulations for Newton Commonwealth Park that required that all dogs be kept on a leash while in the park.

8. Prominent signs posted in Newton Commonwealth Park, including along the jogging paths, state that dogs must be kept on leashes at all times.

9. Upon information and belief, on numerous prior occasions before September 15, 2023, Defendant John Thompson brought a large dog (the “Dog”) to Newton Commonwealth Park and allowed the Dog to run loose off-leash, in violation of the posted leash rules and applicable municipal ordinances.

10. On September 15, 2023, at approximately afternoon hours, Plaintiff was lawfully present in Newton Commonwealth Park, jogging on a paved or packed-dirt path regularly used by joggers and walkers.

11. Plaintiff was exercising reasonable care for her own safety, paying attention to the path ahead of her and her surroundings while jogging at a normal pace.

12. At the same time and place, Defendant was present in Newton Commonwealth Park with the Dog.

13. Defendant’s Dog is a large dog, of a size and appearance such that a reasonable person could anticipate that an uncontrolled charge or approach by such a dog could cause fear, alarm, or evasive action by pedestrians and joggers.

14. On September 15, 2023, Defendant intentionally or recklessly removed or failed to attach the Dog’s leash to the Dog’s collar or harness, despite having the leash in his possession, and allowed the Dog to run free off-leash in an area of the park frequented by joggers and pedestrians.

15. At all relevant times, Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet from the path where Plaintiff was jogging, socializing and speaking with friends, and holding the Dog’s leash over his shoulder rather than exercising physical control over the Dog.

16. While Plaintiff was jogging on the path, Defendant’s Dog suddenly and without warning charged rapidly toward Plaintiff, barking loudly in an aggressive or alarming manner.

17. The Dog approached Plaintiff quickly enough, and in such a manner, that Plaintiff reasonably believed the Dog might bite, knock her down, or otherwise physically harm her if she did not take immediate evasive action.

18. The Dog was not under adequate physical restraint or control by Defendant at the time it charged at Plaintiff.

19. Upon seeing and hearing the Dog charging and barking, and with Defendant located approximately thirty (30) feet away and not in immediate control of the Dog, Plaintiff, acting as a reasonable person under the circumstances, became fearful for her safety and took immediate evasive action to avoid being bitten or attacked.

20. In an effort to avoid the Dog, Plaintiff swerved abruptly off the path to her side, leaving the main jogging surface.

21. As Plaintiff swerved off the path to escape the perceived imminent danger posed by the uncontrolled and charging Dog, she encountered uneven ground and a protruding tree root adjacent to the path.

22. Plaintiff’s foot struck the protruding tree root, causing her to trip, lose her balance, and fall down a small embankment next to the path.

23. Plaintiff landed forcefully, bracing herself with her outstretched arm, and suffered a broken wrist as a direct result of the fall.

24. The Dog itself did not physically contact Plaintiff, because the fall and resulting injury occurred as Plaintiff took evasive action to avoid the Dog.

25. After Plaintiff fell, the Dog stopped advancing and, only then, Defendant called the Dog back to him.

26. Several other joggers and park users in the vicinity witnessed the entire sequence of events, including the Dog’s charge, Plaintiff’s evasive maneuver, and Plaintiff’s fall.

27. Plaintiff immediately experienced pain, shock, and distress following the fall.

28. Plaintiff sought medical attention and was transported to, or later presented at, an emergency room in the Newton/Boston area on or shortly after September 15, 2023.

29. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was evaluated and diagnosed with a fracture of the wrist (a broken wrist).

30. Plaintiff’s injury required immobilization of her wrist with a brace (and/or splint or cast) for a period of weeks.

31. As a result of the broken wrist, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, discomfort, and significant limitations in the use of her arm and hand during the healing period.

32. Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,500 in medical expenses related to emergency treatment, diagnostic imaging, follow-up visits, and related medical care for her broken wrist.

33. Because of the injury, Plaintiff missed work and lost wages of approximately $1,200.

34. Plaintiff’s broken wrist also prevented her from participating in and performing at a piano recital for which she had prepared and practiced over a substantial period of time.

35. Plaintiff’s inability to perform at the recital caused her emotional distress, disappointment, and loss of enjoyment of life.

36. Plaintiff has suffered, and may continue to suffer, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-economic damages as a result of the incident and her injury.

37. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused directly and proximately by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to Defendant’s failure to keep the Dog on a leash and under proper control, and Defendant’s failure to exercise due care to avoid creating a risk of harm to park users such as Plaintiff.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

38. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 37 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

39. Under Massachusetts common law, every person owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); *Muise v. Romney*, 385 Mass. 108, 110 (1982).

40. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control, supervision, and restraint of his Dog in a public park, so as to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to persons lawfully using the park, including joggers such as Plaintiff. See *Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 283 Mass. 158, 161–62 (1933) (duty to exercise reasonable care under circumstances); *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–48 (duty to control third-party conduct when creating or increasing risk of harm).

41. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to comply with applicable statutes, ordinances, and park regulations requiring dogs to be kept on a leash within Newton Commonwealth Park. See, e.g., G.L. c. 140, § 173 (municipal regulation of dogs); *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 359 (1990) (violation of statute or regulation as evidence of negligence).

42. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that allowing a large dog to run loose off-leash, in close proximity to jogging paths, posed a foreseeable risk that the dog could charge at, approach, or startle pedestrians and joggers, causing them to fall or be injured. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–48 (foreseeability of harm governs existence and scope of duty).

**Breach**

43. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to keep the Dog on a leash in accordance with posted park rules and applicable ordinances;  

   b. Allowing the Dog to run loose and uncontrolled in a public park frequented by joggers and pedestrians;  

   c. Failing to maintain physical control over the Dog while socializing with friends, despite knowing that the Dog was off-leash;  

   d. Failing to properly supervise the Dog and prevent it from charging toward park users, including Plaintiff; and  

   e. Failing to timely intervene or recall the Dog before it charged toward Plaintiff, creating a situation of apparent and imminent danger.

44. Defendant’s conduct constituted a failure to act as a reasonably prudent dog owner would act under the same or similar circumstances. See *Andrews*, 283 Mass. at 162; *Oliveria v. Nat’l Amusements, Inc.*, 452 Mass. 53, 57–58 (2008).

45. Defendant’s violation of the park’s leash rules and applicable municipal dog control regulations is evidence of negligence and supports a finding that Defendant breached his duty of care. See *Bennett*, 408 Mass. at 359; *Guinan v. Famous Players-Lasky Corp.*, 267 Mass. 501, 516 (1929).

**Causation**

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, the Dog charged and barked loudly at Plaintiff while off-leash and uncontrolled.

47. It was reasonably foreseeable that a large, barking, off-leash dog charging toward a jogger could cause the jogger to take sudden evasive action and suffer injury as a result. See *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978) (foreseeability of manner of harm not required to be precise, only within scope of risk); *Jesionek* (defendant may be liable where its negligence causes plaintiff to take evasive action leading to injury).

48. Massachusetts law recognizes that a negligent actor is liable for harm that results from a foreseeable reaction or response to the danger created by the actor’s negligence. See *Jesionek*, 376 Mass. at 105–06; *Carter v. Yardley & Co., Ltd.*, 319 Mass. 92, 97–100 (1946).

49. Plaintiff’s decision to swerve off the path to avoid the Dog was a normal, reasonable, and foreseeable reaction by a person confronted with what appeared to be an imminent threat of being bitten or attacked by an uncontrolled, charging, barking dog.

50. Plaintiff’s resulting trip over the tree root and fall down the embankment were directly caused by her evasive maneuver, which in turn was directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent failure to control and leash the Dog.

51. The fact that the Dog did not physically contact Plaintiff does not break the chain of causation; Defendant is liable for the foreseeable injuries caused by Plaintiff’s reasonable efforts to avoid the danger created by Defendant’s negligence. See *Jesionek*, 376 Mass. at 105–06; *Carter*, 319 Mass. at 99–100.

52. Plaintiff’s injuries were a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s negligence and fall within the scope of the risk created by allowing a large dog to run off-leash in a public park. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–48; *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996).

**Damages**

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist and associated physical injuries.

54. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $3,500 for emergency room treatment, diagnostic imaging, follow-up care, and related medical services.

55. Plaintiff lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to time missed from work as a result of her injuries.

56. Plaintiff experienced, and continues to experience, significant physical pain and suffering, including pain, limitation of motion, reduced strength and function in her wrist and arm, and discomfort during daily activities.

57. Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life, including, but not limited to, her inability to participate in and perform at a piano recital for which she had diligently practiced, and limitations on other recreational and personal activities.

58. Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish associated with the incident, the injury, and her resulting limitations.

59. Plaintiff’s damages include past and future medical expenses, lost wages and/or diminished earning capacity, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, and all other damages allowed under Massachusetts law for personal injury caused by negligence. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B; *Conley v. Moran*, 349 Mass. 311, 316 (1965).

**Comparative Negligence**

60. Plaintiff at all relevant times exercised reasonable care for her own safety, and any suggestion that Plaintiff should have acted differently under the sudden threat presented by the charging Dog is misplaced.

61. To the extent Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies any such negligence. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged comparative negligence on the part of Plaintiff would not bar recovery but would only proportionately reduce damages, provided that Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than the total negligence of Defendant.

62. Plaintiff’s reaction was that of a reasonable person confronted with a sudden emergency not of her own making, and such conduct does not constitute negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Hanlon v. Town of Southborough*, 381 Mass. 123, 126–27 (1980) (discussing reasonable conduct under emergency circumstances).
