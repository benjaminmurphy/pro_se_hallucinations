      "support_reasoning": "The opinion in Rosenberg v. Merida concerns child support, attachment of assets, and a change from shared to sole legal custody; it does not discuss parenting time/visitation conditions or restrictions aimed at third parties in the home. The only pertinent language is a general statement that Probate and Family Court judges have broad discretion in divorce matters to protect children\u2019s interests, but it is in the context of financial security and college expenses, not tailoring visitation conditions or prohibiting contact with specific individuals. Thus, the case does not substantively support the specific proposition about conditioning parenting time based on third-party risks.",
