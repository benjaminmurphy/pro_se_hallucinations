      "proposition": "Massachusetts law recognizes that the use of third\u2011party caregivers may be relevant to a child\u2019s best interests, especially when it results in instability, insufficient supervision, or exposure to individuals not vetted by the other parent or the Court.",

      "support_confidence": "medium",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does recognize that the nature and consequences of a substitute caregiver arrangement (including instability in a foster home) are relevant to a child\u2019s best interests. The court notes the disruptions in the foster home caused by changing foster children and explicitly approves the trial judge\u2019s reliance on this in light of expert testimony that Hugo needed a consistent and predictable environment. However, the case does not squarely address \u201cunvetted\u201d third parties or supervision problems as a doctrinal point; its support is more inferential than explicit.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAs to his finding that Ms. L. derived her income from foster care, the judge appropriately took note of disruptions within the foster family that Hugo had experienced and might continue to experience as foster children enter and leave Ms. L.\u2019s home, a relevant matter in light of the expert testimony that Hugo needs a consistent and predictable home environment.\u201d"
