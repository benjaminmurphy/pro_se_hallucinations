COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
(Jury Trial Demanded)

Plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant ABC Realty Management (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jane Doe is an individual residing on the third floor of a residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant ABC Realty Management is a business entity engaged in the ownership, management, operation, and/or control of residential rental property in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was the landlord and/or property manager responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair, and safety of the common areas of the Premises, including the common hallways and smoke detectors serving Plaintiff’s apartment.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of personal injuries and property damage sustained by Plaintiff in Lynn, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $7,500 in medical expenses and $2,000 in lost wages, exclusive of pain and suffering and other damages, and is within the jurisdictional limits of the Lynn District Court. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A.

6. Venue is proper in the Lynn District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred at the Premises located at 123 Maple Street in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. At all times relevant, Plaintiff resided as a lawful tenant on the third floor of the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.

8. The common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment is equipped, or is required to be equipped, with a smoke detector and/or fire alarm device intended to provide early warning of fire to residents on Plaintiff’s floor.

9. For an extended period of months prior to September 15, 2023, the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit emitted periodic “chirping” sounds, indicating a low or failing battery.

10. Rather than being properly maintained, serviced, or having its battery replaced by Defendant, someone—identity unknown to Plaintiff—removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector and left it on a nearby windowsill.

11. Following removal of the battery, the hallway smoke detector had no power source and was non‑functional, rendering it unable to detect smoke or provide an audible alarm.

12. Defendant, as landlord and property manager, had a nondelegable duty to maintain the common areas of the Premises, including smoke detectors and related life‑safety systems, in a reasonably safe condition and in compliance with Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

13. Massachusetts regulations, including but not limited to 105 CMR 410.482 and related provisions of the State Sanitary Code, require landlords to provide and maintain smoke detection and fire warning systems in residential rental premises.

14. The Massachusetts State Building Code and State Fire Code likewise require properly functioning smoke detection in common areas of multi‑unit residential buildings, including common halls that serve as egress routes for tenants. See, e.g., 780 CMR (State Building Code) and 527 CMR (State Fire Code).

15. Plaintiff personally observed that the battery had been removed from the hallway smoke detector outside her unit and was sitting loose on the windowsill for an extended time before the incident described below.

16. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the defective and non‑functioning hallway smoke detector on at least three separate occasions, verbally and/or in writing, prior to September 15, 2023.

17. On each of these occasions, Plaintiff informed Defendant that the hallway smoke detector was chirping, that the battery had been removed, and that the device was not operational.

18. In response to these notices, Defendant’s agents or employees told Plaintiff that Defendant would “take care of it,” thereby acknowledging awareness of the condition and undertaking to correct it.

19. Despite repeated notice and opportunity to repair, replace, or restore the smoke detector to proper working order, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to address the missing battery or otherwise ensure that the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was functional.

20. On or about the night of September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first‑floor apartment at the Premises, believed to have originated in that apartment’s kitchen.

21. At the time of the fire, the hallway smoke detector on Plaintiff’s floor, outside her unit, remained without a battery and non‑operational.

22. Because the hallway smoke detector had no battery and was inoperative, it failed to activate or sound any alarm when smoke from the first‑floor fire migrated to the upper floors, including the third‑floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment.

23. Plaintiff received no audible warning from the hallway smoke detector or other fire alarm device on her floor, and therefore remained unaware of the fire until smoke had already accumulated in the hallway.

24. Plaintiff first became aware that something was wrong when she smelled smoke inside her apartment.

25. When Plaintiff opened her door into the common hallway, she found that the hallway was already thick with smoke, significantly impairing visibility and breathing.

26. Plaintiff attempted to evacuate the building via the common hallway and stairway, but was forced to pass through dense smoke in order to exit, as she had not received early warning that would have allowed her to leave sooner.

27. As a direct consequence of the late discovery of the fire and the heavy smoke in the common areas, Plaintiff inhaled substantial quantities of smoke, causing her to experience difficulty breathing, coughing, chest discomfort, and other symptoms.

28. Emergency responders were called to the scene, and Plaintiff was transported to a hospital, where she was examined and treated for smoke inhalation and associated respiratory distress.

29. Plaintiff remained at the hospital overnight for observation and treatment related to smoke inhalation.

30. Following her discharge, Plaintiff required additional medical care, including follow‑up visits and treatment for ongoing breathing difficulties and related symptoms.

31. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $7,500 as a result of the injuries she sustained from smoke inhalation and related treatment.

32. Plaintiff was unable to work for a period following the incident because of her injuries and recovery, resulting in lost wages of approximately $2,000.

33. In addition to her personal injuries, Plaintiff’s personal property located in her apartment, including clothing, furniture, electronics, and household items, sustained substantial smoke and water damage from the fire and firefighting efforts.

34. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, physical discomfort, anxiety, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the fire and her injuries.

35. The absence of a functional hallway smoke detector and the resulting delay in warning substantially increased Plaintiff’s exposure to smoke and materially contributed to the seriousness of her injuries and the extent of her property damage.

36. Had the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment been properly maintained, with a working battery, it would have sounded an alarm at an earlier stage of the fire, providing Plaintiff with timely notice and an opportunity to evacuate before the hallway filled with heavy smoke.

37. Defendant had actual notice of the defective smoke detector through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and/or, at a minimum, constructive notice of the condition, yet failed to remedy it in a timely and reasonable manner.

38. Defendant’s failure to maintain a working smoke detector in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit constituted a dangerous condition in a common area under Defendant’s control.

39. Defendant knew or should have known that non‑functioning smoke detectors in common egress areas of a multi‑unit building pose a foreseeable and serious risk of injury to tenants in the event of fire.

40. Defendant’s conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and other residents of the Premises, and the injuries suffered by Plaintiff were the foreseeable result of that risk.

---

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (Sole Cause of Action)

41. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

42. Defendant, as landlord and property manager, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including all common areas and common safety devices such as smoke detectors, in a safe condition and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. See Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162, 169 (1980) (landlord owes duty of reasonable care as to common areas and, in residential tenancies, to lawful visitors and occupants).

43. Defendant’s duty arises from the common law of negligence, the implied warranty of habitability, and statutory and regulatory obligations, including but not limited to:

   a. G.L. c. 186, § 14 (requiring landlords to maintain premises in compliance with law and not to interfere with quiet enjoyment);  
   b. G.L. c. 143 and related provisions of the State Building Code (780 CMR), requiring appropriate fire and life‑safety equipment; and  
   c. 105 CMR 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), including requirements for smoke detectors and fire warning systems.

44. Massachusetts law recognizes that landlords must exercise reasonable care to prevent defective conditions in areas under their control that create a risk of harm to tenants, including dangers from fire and smoke. See Lindsey v. Massios, 372 Mass. 79, 82–83 (1977); King v. G & M Realty Corp., 373 Mass. 658, 660–61 (1977).

45. Defendant also had a duty, once notified of a defective smoke detector or similar hazard, to take reasonable steps within a reasonable time to repair, replace, or otherwise correct the condition. See Lyon v. Morphew, 424 Mass. 828, 832 (1997).

**Breach**

46. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to the following acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to inspect, maintain, and repair the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit;  
   b. Allowing the smoke detector to operate for months with a low battery, as evidenced by persistent “chirping,” without timely replacing the battery;  
   c. Permitting the battery to be removed and left on a windowsill, leaving the smoke detector non‑functional;  
   d. Failing to restore power to the detector or replace it with a functioning device;  
   e. Failing to respond adequately and promptly to Plaintiff’s at least three complaints and notices that the detector was malfunctioning and had no battery;  
   f. Failing to comply with applicable statutes, codes, and regulations requiring functional smoke detectors in common hallways and egress routes; and  
   g. Failing to take reasonable measures to ensure that fire‑safety and life‑safety systems at the Premises were in good working order.

47. Massachusetts law holds that violation of a safety statute or regulation designed to protect tenants may be evidence of negligence. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990); Perry v. Medeiros, 369 Mass. 836, 841–42 (1976).

48. Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain a functioning hallway smoke detector as required by the State Sanitary Code and fire‑safety regulations constitutes evidence of negligence and a breach of Defendant’s duty to Plaintiff. See 105 CMR 410.482 (smoke and carbon monoxide alarms) and related sections.

49. Defendant’s conduct in ignoring Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and failing to “take care of” the problem within a reasonable time constitutes a further breach of its duty of reasonable care. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 379 (2010) (reasonable care standard applies to property owners as to hazards they know or should know about).

**Causation**

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff did not receive timely audible warning of the fire in the building on September 15, 2023.

51. The absence of a functioning hallway smoke detector delayed Plaintiff’s awareness of the fire until the hallway was already filled with dense smoke, causing Plaintiff to traverse a hazardous smoke‑filled environment in order to exit the building.

52. The delayed warning and consequent exposure to heavy smoke were substantial contributing causes of Plaintiff’s smoke inhalation injuries, respiratory distress, hospitalization, and continuing symptoms.

53. The same delay and the resulting spread of smoke and water into Plaintiff’s apartment also caused or materially contributed to the smoke and water damage to Plaintiff’s personal property.

54. Plaintiff’s injuries were the foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain functional smoke detection equipment in a multi‑unit residential building. Fires in such buildings are a well‑known risk, and the purpose of smoke detectors is precisely to reduce the risk of injury from delayed detection and evacuation.

55. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s injuries and damages and was a proximate cause of those injuries under Massachusetts law. See Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law on causation); Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002).

**Damages**

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:

   a. Bodily injury, including smoke inhalation and associated respiratory problems;  
   b. Past and future medical expenses, reasonably estimated at approximately $7,500 to date and subject to proof at trial;  
   c. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $2,000 in wages lost due to time missed from work;  
   d. Damage to and loss of personal property due to smoke and water, including but not limited to clothing, furniture, electronics, and household items, in an amount to be determined at trial;  
   e. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, breathing difficulties, and discomfort;  
   f. Emotional distress, anxiety, fear, and loss of peace of mind arising from the fire, the dangerous conditions encountered during evacuation, and ongoing concerns about safety; and  
   g. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal activities.

57. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and compensation for pain and suffering. See G.L. c. 231, § 60H; Santos v. Chrysler Corp., 430 Mass. 198, 217 (1999); Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 549–50 (1982).

58. To the extent any of Defendant’s conduct is found to constitute a willful or knowing violation of statutory obligations relating to the condition of the Premises, Plaintiff reserves all rights to seek any enhanced or multiple damages available under applicable statutes, including G.L. c. 93A and G.L. c. 186, § 14, although the present Complaint sounds solely in common‑law negligence.
