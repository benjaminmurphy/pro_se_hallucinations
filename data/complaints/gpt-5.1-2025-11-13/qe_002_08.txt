COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Samantha Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Linda Carver (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Samantha Johnson is an individual residing at 27 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Linda Carver is an individual and the owner and landlord of the Premises located at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was and is responsible for maintaining the Premises in compliance with applicable law, including the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and local housing codes, and for honoring the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff as a residential tenant.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises out of Defendant’s breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, is approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00), plus statutory damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14.

6. Jurisdiction is proper in the Housing Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 20, because this action concerns residential landlord–tenant relations, conditions at a residential dwelling, and alleged violations of tenants’ statutory rights.

7. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Roxbury, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department. See G.L. c. 185C, § 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

9. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the basement unit located at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119, with Defendant as landlord.

10. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) to Defendant for the Premises.

11. Plaintiff’s tenancy is and has been a residential tenancy governed by G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

12. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late paying the October rent due to medical bills. Plaintiff subsequently paid the October rent in full, including the late fee charged by Defendant.

13. On information and belief, after October 2025, Plaintiff was not in material default of her rental obligations and remained a lawful tenant entitled to the protections of Massachusetts landlord–tenant law, including the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.

14. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff began to notice water seeping into the basement apartment through at least one basement wall whenever there was heavy rain.

15. The water intrusion occurred repeatedly during or following periods of heavy rain and caused the floor and lower portions of the wall to become wet and damp.

16. The water intrusion created damp conditions that required Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier on a near‑constant basis in order to minimize moisture, odors, and potential mold growth.

17. On or about a date in November 2025, after Plaintiff noticed the water problem, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message about the water seeping into the unit during heavy rain.

18. Defendant responded to Plaintiff that she would “look into it,” thereby acknowledging notice of the condition.

19. Despite this notice, weeks went by without Defendant making any repairs or arranging for any professional inspection or remediation of the water problem.

20. The water intrusion and resulting dampness damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including at least one rug and a bookshelf located against or near the affected wall, with total property damage of approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00).

21. The presence of water infiltration and dampness at the Premises rendered the basement unit less safe, less sanitary, and less habitable, and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as a residence.

22. Because Defendant did not timely and adequately address the water intrusion, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston housing or inspection authorities (“the City”) to request an inspection of the Premises.

23. The City conducted an inspection of the Premises in or about late November 2025.

24. During that inspection, the City identified the water‑penetration issue as a violation and also identified additional housing or sanitary code violations at the Premises.

25. Upon information and belief, the conditions observed by the City and identified as violations included, but were not necessarily limited to, ongoing water penetration into a habitable area of the dwelling and related sanitary and safety concerns, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500 (structural elements to be kept in good repair; protections against water and dampness).

26. Defendant was informed or should have been informed of the City’s findings and cited violations, and thus had further and unequivocal notice of the defective and unsafe conditions at the Premises.

27. Despite Plaintiff’s prior notice and the City’s inspection and identification of violations, Defendant did not timely or adequately repair or correct the water intrusion problem.

28. At the time of filing this Complaint, the water intrusion into the basement unit during heavy rain remains unresolved or inadequately resolved, continuing to interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

29. As a direct result of the continuing water intrusion and dampness, Plaintiff has sustained property damage, incurred increased electricity usage and costs to run a dehumidifier, and endured substantial discomfort, inconvenience, and anxiety regarding the safety and habitability of her home.

30. Following the City’s inspection and the issuance or identification of code violations, Defendant began to treat Plaintiff as a “problem tenant,” including by making statements characterizing Plaintiff as such and otherwise exhibiting hostility or displeasure with Plaintiff’s decision to contact the City.

31. After the inspection and code citations, Defendant informed Plaintiff that Defendant would not be renewing Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 (or March of the upcoming lease‑end month, hereafter “March”).

32. Defendant has stated that the non‑renewal decision is based on Plaintiff’s late payment of rent in October 2025, despite the fact that Plaintiff paid the October rent and late fee in full and has not been chronically late or in material breach.

33. The timing of Defendant’s non‑renewal decision, which followed shortly after Plaintiff contacted the City and an inspection revealed code violations at the Premises, is suspicious and suggests that Defendant’s adverse action was, at least in part, in retaliation for Plaintiff’s exercise of her rights to call the City and seek enforcement of housing and sanitary codes.

34. Defendant’s failure to repair the water intrusion and failure to maintain the Premises in compliance with applicable housing and sanitary codes after repeated notice from Plaintiff and the City, as well as Defendant’s treatment of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and decision not to renew the lease under these circumstances, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
**(Breach of Statutory Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

35. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

36. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment, which provides in pertinent part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly” interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises by any act or omission.

37. G.L. c. 186, § 14 further provides that a landlord who violates this covenant is liable for actual and consequential damages or for statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

38. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that a landlord’s failure to maintain leased premises in a habitable and code‑compliant condition, especially after notice of serious defects, can constitute an unlawful interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:

   a. **Hemingway v. Commonwealth**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and relationship between serious housing code violations and tenant remedies);

   b. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfered with tenants’ use, even without actual intent);

   c. **Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (linking code violations to breach of landlord obligations);

   d. **Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord’s failure to correct serious conditions after notice supports finding of breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14);

   e. **Dorgan v. Loukas**, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 705 (2011) (substantial interference with habitability and safety constitutes breach of quiet enjoyment);

   f. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment breached by conditions substantially interfering with safe occupancy);

   g. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s conduct causing severe interference with tenant’s psychological and physical well‑being can breach quiet enjoyment);

   h. **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (memorandum) (landlord’s neglect of serious housing defects following notice may constitute breach of quiet enjoyment).

39. The State Sanitary Code, promulgated under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, requires that residential premises be maintained in safe and sanitary condition free from chronic dampness or water penetration. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.550, and related provisions regarding water, structural integrity, and prevention of moisture and related hazards.

40. Violations of the State Sanitary Code can support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 when they materially affect the health or safety of occupants. See, e.g., **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (housing code violations and failure to remedy conditions support tenant remedies and rent abatement); **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (code violations and landlord inaction after notice constitute substantial interference).

41. Defendant had actual notice of the water intrusion and dampness no later than November 2025, when Plaintiff texted Defendant and described water seeping through the basement wall during heavy rain.

42. Defendant had further actual and/or constructive notice of the conditions and code violations from the City inspection conducted in or about late November 2025.

43. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take timely and adequate steps to identify, correct, and remediate the water intrusion and resulting dampness at the Premises.

44. Defendant’s inaction and failure to repair the water intrusion and related code violations over a period of weeks or longer, after repeated notice, constituted a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a safe and habitable residence.

45. Plaintiff’s repeated exposure to water intrusion, dampness, property damage, and the need to run a dehumidifier constantly to mitigate moisture constitute a material impairment of the character and value of her tenancy, and of her right to occupy the Premises in peace and safety.

46. In Massachusetts, a landlord’s “omission” can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment when it foreseeably and substantially interferes with the tenant’s use of the premises. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 718–719 (landlord liable for interference by failing to take steps within his control); **Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. at 851–852.

47. Defendant’s failure to correct the water problem and code violations, after notice from both Plaintiff and the City, was an omission within Defendant’s control and foreseeably interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.

48. In addition, Defendant’s decision to treat Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” after the City inspection and to inform Plaintiff that her lease would not be renewed in March, closely following Plaintiff’s exercise of her rights to contact housing authorities, further interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment by creating an atmosphere of hostility, insecurity, and threatened loss of housing.

49. Defendant’s adverse treatment of Plaintiff and decision not to renew the tenancy, following Plaintiff’s report of code violations, is consistent with retaliatory conduct and coercive interference with Plaintiff’s statutory rights. See G.L. c. 186, § 18 (prohibiting retaliation for tenant’s contact with housing inspectors); **Spence v. O’Brien**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983) (retaliatory actions by landlord after tenant complaints can violate statutory tenant protections and quiet enjoyment).

50. Whether or not labeled as “retaliation” in this Complaint, Defendant’s conduct in response to Plaintiff’s protected activity—including threats of non‑renewal and characterizing Plaintiff as a “problem tenant”—constitutes indirect interference with Plaintiff’s peaceful and secure enjoyment of her home within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

51. Massachusetts courts have held that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when a landlord “seriously interferes with the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the leased premises,” including by acts of harassment, intimidation, or sustained failure to correct defective conditions after notice. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 102–104; **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. at 284–285.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Property damage to personal belongings, including a rug and bookshelf, in the amount of approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00);

   b. Increased electricity usage and costs due to the necessity of running a dehumidifier on a more‑or‑less constant basis;

   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Premises due to water intrusion, dampness, and the need to move or remove belongings from the affected areas;

   d. Discomfort, inconvenience, anxiety, and emotional distress associated with living in a damp and potentially unsafe environment and facing threats to the continuation of her tenancy following her exercise of legal rights.

53. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages arising from Defendant’s breach of quiet enjoyment or, in the alternative, statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

54. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is approximately $1,200.00, so three months’ rent equals $3,600.00.

55. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages of at least $3,600.00 under G.L. c. 186, § 14, or such amount as the Court finds just and proper under the statute, plus her property damages of approximately $400.00, additional consequential damages (including increased utility costs), and all other relief allowed by law.

56. Defendant’s acts and omissions were willful, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, in that Defendant consciously ignored multiple notices of serious conditions from Plaintiff and the City and persisted in failing to remedy those conditions while also taking adverse housing‑related action against Plaintiff following her report to the City.

57. In light of the above, Defendant has breached the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts law, including but not limited to the authorities cited above.
