    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

Plaintiff Jessica Taylor (“Plaintiff”), acting pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Stevens (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Taylor is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant Mark Stevens, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing residential tenancies, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases.

5. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000, and this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and applicable rules of the District Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department because the Premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 223, § 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–6 as if fully stated herein.

8. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

9. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises from on or about January 1, 2022 through the present.

10. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant for the Premises.

11. At all relevant times, Defendant has had responsibility for providing and maintaining essential services to the Premises, including hot water, in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

12. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.190 and related provisions of the State Sanitary Code, a landlord of a residential dwelling in Massachusetts is required to provide and maintain facilities capable of heating water to prescribed minimum temperatures for bathing and cleaning.

13. Under G.L. c. 239, § 8A and settled case law, compliance with the State Sanitary Code is an implied condition of every residential tenancy. See, e.g., *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 187–88 (1973).

14. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified and protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14, and by common law. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

15. Pursuant to that covenant, Plaintiff is entitled to the undisturbed and habitable use and enjoyment of the Premises, including access to essential services such as hot water.

16. Approximately three weeks before the date of this Complaint, in or about early November 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s Apartment stopped working.

17. On the same day that the hot water went out, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water.

18. Defendant responded that the water heater needed a part and that he had ordered the part.

19. Approximately one week later, the hot water had still not been restored. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant and reported the continuing loss of hot water.

20. Defendant responded that the needed part was “backordered” and stated that he was waiting for it to arrive.

21. Approximately another week passed with no hot water. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant; Defendant again responded that he was “working on it” and still waiting for the part.

22. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water in her Apartment for approximately three weeks.

23. Throughout this period, Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers in her Apartment.

24. Plaintiff has incurred additional out-of-pocket expenses to maintain basic hygiene because of the lack of hot water, including, but not limited to, paying approximately $30 per month for a gym membership that she did not previously need, in order to have access to hot showers, and the cost of fuel to travel to and from the gym.

25. Plaintiff is the parent of a young baby. Because it is unsafe and unreasonable to bathe her baby in cold water, Plaintiff has been forced to transport her baby to Plaintiff’s mother’s home for baths.

26. The lack of hot water has made daily living significantly more difficult, unsanitary, and stressful for Plaintiff and her child, and has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a habitable residence.

27. The continued absence of hot water for an extended period is a serious violation of the State Sanitary Code and constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–202 (1979) (substantial interference with quiet enjoyment can arise from conditions endangering health or safety, including code violations); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

28. Defendant has remained aware of the lack of hot water since Plaintiff first reported it, yet, as of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to take effective and timely measures to restore hot water to the Premises.

29. While Defendant has communicated with Plaintiff and stated that he is “working on it,” Defendant has nonetheless allowed the condition—no hot water—to persist for about three weeks, with no definite end date or alternative arrangements to ensure Plaintiff has hot water in her home.

30. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is strictly liable for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord, “directly or indirectly, by himself or his servants or other persons acting for him, interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982) (landlord’s liability under § 14 does not require intent to harm, only that the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s action or inaction is interference with quiet enjoyment).

31. The extended failure to provide hot water, an essential service required by law, constitutes such an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, even if Defendant did not subjectively intend to harm Plaintiff. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03 (landlord’s failure to correct serious conditions can breach quiet enjoyment); *Dartmouth v. Silva*, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 416, 421–23 (2004).

32. Defendant had a duty to ensure that the Premises complied with the State Sanitary Code and to timely repair or replace equipment necessary to provide hot water. See *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 200–01; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

33. Defendant’s delay and failure to restore hot water for approximately three weeks, despite repeated notice and requests from Plaintiff, is unreasonable and constitutes a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

34. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use of hot water in her home for approximately three weeks;

   b. Out-of-pocket costs for a gym membership (approximately $30 per month) for access to hot showers;

   c. Additional transportation costs (gas and related expenses) to travel to and from the gym and her mother’s home;

   d. Inconvenience, disruption of daily life, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises as a habitable residence;

   e. Emotional distress, frustration, and discomfort associated with living without hot water and having to make alternative arrangements for herself and her baby.

35. Plaintiff estimates her actual monetary damages to be at least $400.00, and reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial.

36. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant who establishes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. See *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 199–202; *Leardi v. Brown*, 394 Mass. 151, 159–63 (1985).

37. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00; three months’ rent is therefore $3,600.00, which is greater than the $400.00 in actual damages Plaintiff currently estimates.

38. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in the amount of three months’ rent, or $3,600.00, or such other amount as the Court deems just, plus costs and any attorney’s fees to which she may be entitled by statute or otherwise.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

39. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–38 as though fully set forth herein.

40. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful tenant in possession of the Premises under an agreement with Defendant and subject to the protections of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized in Massachusetts common law.

41. Defendant, as landlord, had a non-delegable duty to provide and maintain the Premises in habitable condition, including compliance with the State Sanitary Code requirements for hot water, and to refrain from actions or omissions that would directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises. See *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 200–01; *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 716–18.

42. The prolonged lack of hot water at the Premises—approximately three weeks or more—constitutes a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home and violates the State Sanitary Code and the implied warranty of habitability. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Guirola*, 410 Mass. 820, 823–24 (1991); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

43. Defendant knew or should have known of the lack of hot water from the date Plaintiff first reported the condition and on multiple subsequent occasions.

44. Despite this notice and the serious nature of the condition, Defendant failed to take effective and timely steps to restore hot water to the Premises for approximately three weeks.

45. Defendant’s failure and delay, under the circumstances, constitute an unreasonable and unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Lowery*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983; *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

46. Defendant’s breach does not require proof of malice or bad faith; it is sufficient that the natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s acts or omissions was a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 716–18; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 199–202.

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including, but not limited to, the loss of hot water, the cost of alternative facilities (gym membership and travel), inconvenience, and emotional distress.

48. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See *Leardi*, 394 Mass. at 159–63; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 199–202.
