  Defendant / Respondent.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)


NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother” or “Plaintiff”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Smith (“Father” or “Defendant”), and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Sophie Smith (d.o.b. ________, age 10) and Jacob Smith (d.o.b. ________, age 8) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31; G.L. c. 209, § 37 (if applicable); and its general equity jurisdiction in matters concerning custody, parenting time, and the welfare of minor children.

4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody and parenting orders were issued by this Court, both parties reside in, or have substantial connections to, Bristol County, and the Children reside primarily with the Plaintiff in this county.

---

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

5. On or about April 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2021 Order”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the Children.

6. The 2021 Order provides, in substance, that the parties share joint legal custody of the Children, with the Children residing primarily with the Plaintiff and visiting with the Defendant on a regular schedule, including every other weekend.

7. The 2021 Order further provides, in substance, that:

   a. Each parent shall foster and support the Children’s relationship with the other parent; and  

   b. Neither parent shall disparage the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children.

8. The 2021 Order remains in full force and effect unless and until modified by this Court.

---

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

9. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a judgment relative to custody or parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment and where modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.

10. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must consider the best interests of the child as the paramount concern in determining custody, including the past and present parental cooperation, capacity to meet the child’s needs, and willingness to support the child’s relationship with the other parent.

11. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a custody or parenting judgment may be modified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and when modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g.:

   a. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (material and substantial change and best interests standard govern modification of custody);  

   b. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (change in circumstances must be substantial and relate to the child’s welfare);  

   c. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (best interests of the child are paramount; court evaluates parental ability to cooperate and place child’s needs first);  

   d. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (modification appropriate where prior arrangements no longer serve child’s welfare);  

   e. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (central inquiry is stability and best interests; court may adjust arrangements when conflict between parents adversely affects the child);  

   f. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests analysis emphasizes emotional, physical, and developmental needs of child);  

   g. *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016) (parent’s conduct that undermines child’s relationship with other parent is relevant to custody determinations);  

   h. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (pattern of interference with parenting time and poor communication may justify modification);  

   i. *Cabot v. Cabot*, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 756 (2002) (Court considers each parent’s willingness and ability to foster relationship with the other parent);  

   j. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (emphasizing that stability and a parenting plan that minimizes conflict are in the child’s best interests).

12. Courts may also reconsider joint legal custody where there is substantial, ongoing parental conflict or a demonstrated inability to communicate and cooperate about significant child-related decisions. *See, e.g., Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840–842; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–185.

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

13. Since entry of the 2021 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the Children and the functioning of the current custody and parenting-time arrangement.

14. Over the past year, the Defendant has repeatedly enrolled the Children in extracurricular and other activities that are scheduled during the Plaintiff’s designated parenting time (including weekends that, under the 2021 Order, belong to the Plaintiff) without prior discussion, consultation, or agreement with the Plaintiff.

15. By signing the Children up for activities during the Plaintiff’s scheduled weekends without consultation, the Defendant has:

   a. Compromised the predictability and stability of the parenting-time schedule;  

   b. Effectively reduced the Plaintiff’s parenting time without Court approval; and  

   c. Created recurrent conflict between the parties which the Children experience and report.

16. The Plaintiff has attempted to address these scheduling issues by requesting reasonable swaps of weekends and by seeking communication regarding activities, but the Defendant has not cooperated in a manner consistent with joint legal custody and the spirit of the 2021 Order.

17. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that, when they are with the Defendant, he tells them that it is the Plaintiff’s “fault” if they miss activities scheduled on the Plaintiff’s weekends, and that this is because the Plaintiff is “selfish.”

18. The Children have further reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant has told them or strongly implied that the Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” when she asks to swap weekends or seeks to exercise her parenting time as provided in the 2021 Order.

19. These statements to the Children disparage the Plaintiff, directly undermine her relationship with the Children, and are contrary to the 2021 Order’s requirement that each parent support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparagement.

20. The Children’s exposure to this conflict and disparagement has had an observable, negative impact on their emotional and physical well-being. One of the Children has begun experiencing stomach aches and physical distress specifically associated with transition days between households.

21. The Plaintiff reasonably believes, and is informed and believes, that these stomach aches and related symptoms are stress-related and tied to the conflict between the parties and the disparaging comments and blame placed on the Plaintiff in the presence of the Children.

22. The ongoing conflict, scheduling interference, and disparagement have eroded the cooperative co‑parenting relationship contemplated by joint legal custody, such that the parties are no longer able to effectively share decision-making authority in a way that serves the Children’s best interests.

23. The Defendant’s conduct, as alleged above, reflects a persistent pattern of:

   a. Making unilateral decisions about significant aspects of the Children’s lives (activities and weekend commitments) during the Plaintiff’s parenting time;  

   b. Failing to reasonably consult or communicate with the Plaintiff in advance; and  

   c. Undermining the Children’s trust in and relationship with the Plaintiff by blaming her for missed activities and calling her “selfish” and suggesting she does not love the Children.

24. These changes in circumstances—occurring well after the 2021 Order—are substantial and bear directly on the Children’s welfare, stability, and emotional security and thus satisfy the requirement of a material and substantial change under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law.

25. Continued adherence to the current joint legal custody and parenting schedule, without modification, will likely perpetuate or worsen the Children’s stress, physical symptoms, and emotional conflict, and will continue to expose them to disparagement and loyalty conflicts between their parents.

26. A more clearly defined and appropriately adjusted custodial and parenting-time arrangement is necessary to:

   a. Re‑establish predictability and stability for the Children;  

   b. Reduce conflict and the Children’s exposure to parental disputes;  

   c. Protect and strengthen the Children’s relationship with each parent; and  

   d. Ensure that scheduling decisions and communications are handled in a manner consistent with their best interests.

---

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

27. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the case law cited above, the best interests of the child standard governs all custody and parenting-time determinations.

28. The Children have historically resided primarily with the Plaintiff and continue to do so under the 2021 Order; the Plaintiff provides for their daily care, schooling, routines, and general welfare.

29. The stability of the Children’s primary residence with the Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, beneficial to them. The primary disruption and distress are arising from conflicts around the current parenting-time schedule and the Defendant’s unilateral scheduling of activities on the Plaintiff’s time, combined with disparaging statements.

30. The Plaintiff is willing and able to foster the Children’s relationship with the Defendant and supports appropriate and consistent parenting time for the Defendant, provided that:

   a. The schedule is clear and predictable;  

   b. Major scheduling decisions for the Children, including extracurricular and recurring weekend activities, are made with appropriate consultation; and  

   c. Both parents strictly refrain from disparaging each other to, or in the presence of, the Children.

31. The Defendant’s repeated disparagement of the Plaintiff to the Children and his blaming of the Plaintiff for missed activities interfere with the Children’s emotional security, place them in the middle of adult conflict, and are inconsistent with the best-interests standard articulated in *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677, and *Cabot v. Cabot*, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 756.

32. A modification of the current order is necessary to:

   a. Clarify that the Children’s primary residence is with the Plaintiff;  

   b. Establish or confirm a parenting-time schedule that is less susceptible to unilateral alteration;  

   c. Provide clear rules regarding consultation and agreement before activities are scheduled on the other parent’s parenting time; and  

   d. Protect the Children from future disparagement or blame from either parent.

33. A modified order that reduces conflict, reinforces non-disparagement, and clarifies scheduling responsibilities will further the Children’s emotional, physical, and developmental well‑being, consistent with the principles set forth in *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704; and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177.

---

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

34. In light of the material and substantial changes described above and the best interests of the Children, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2021 Order as follows (language to be refined by the Court as appropriate):

**A. Legal and Physical Custody**

35. That the Court confirm and clarify that the Children’s primary physical residence shall be with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson.

36. That the Court modify the existing joint legal custody arrangement as necessary to ensure that significant decisions concerning the Children (including education, medical care, and major extracurricular commitments) are made in a manner that:

   a. Requires meaningful consultation between the parties; and  

   b. Provides a clear mechanism for resolving impasses so that the Children’s best interests are not compromised by ongoing parental conflict.

(If the Court determines that joint legal custody is no longer workable due to the parties’ inability to cooperate, the Plaintiff requests that the Court award sole legal custody to the Plaintiff, or such other allocation of decision‑making authority as the Court deems in the Children’s best interests.)

**B. Parenting Time / Schedule**

37. That the Court enter a clear and specific parenting-time schedule, confirming that:

   a. The Children shall continue to reside primarily with the Plaintiff; and  

   b. The Defendant shall have regular parenting time on alternating weekends and such additional time as the Court deems appropriate, provided that the schedule is predictable and not unilaterally altered.

38. That the order expressly provide that neither party shall enroll the Children in ongoing, recurring, or mandatory activities that occur during the other parent’s scheduled parenting time without prior notice and reasonable opportunity to discuss, and, absent agreement, without further order of the Court.

39. That the order provide that if either parent wishes to schedule a special event or activity during the other parent’s time, the requesting parent shall:

   a. Provide reasonable advance notice;  

   b. Seek mutual agreement in good faith; and  

   c. Not pressure or blame the Children or disparage the other parent if the schedule cannot be changed.

**C. Non‑Disparagement and Communication**

40. That the Court reaffirm and strengthen the non-disparagement provisions of the 2021 Order by including specific language prohibiting each parent from:

   a. Making any disparaging, critical, or demeaning remarks about the other parent in the presence, hearing, or knowledge of the Children;  

   b. Attributing blame to the other parent in a manner that places the Children in the middle of parental conflict, including statements that the other parent does not love the Children or is selfish; and  

   c. Using the Children to relay messages, negotiate schedule disputes, or otherwise act as intermediaries.

41. That the Court require that necessary co‑parenting communications about scheduling and major decisions occur directly between the parties (or through a mutually agreed platform such as a parenting communication application or email), and not through the Children.

**D. Additional Relief**

42. That the Court order such further provisions regarding:

   a. Dispute‑resolution procedures for non‑emergency disagreements (for example, mandatory written communication before filing future motions on minor scheduling issues);  

   b. Any counseling or co‑parenting education that the Court deems appropriate to reduce conflict and support the Children; and  

   c. Any other terms the Court finds necessary to protect the Children’s best interests, promote stability, and minimize exposure to parental conflict.

---

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the April 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time order;

2. Find that modification of custody and parenting-time arrangements is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor Children, Sophie Smith and Jacob Smith;

3. Modify the 2021 Order to confirm that the Children’s primary physical residence shall be with the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson;

4. Modify the existing legal custody arrangement as necessary to ensure effective, child‑focused decision making, up to and including awarding sole legal custody to the Plaintiff if the Court finds joint legal custody is no longer in the Children’s best interests;

5. Enter a clear and specific parenting-time schedule for the Defendant that preserves predictable, regular contact while minimizing conflict and unilateral alterations;

6. Order that neither parent may unilaterally enroll the Children in ongoing or recurring activities scheduled during the other parent’s court‑ordered parenting time without prior consultation and, absent agreement, further order of the Court;

7. Strengthen and clarify non‑disparagement and communication provisions so as to prohibit any disparagement of the other parent to, or in the presence of, the Children, and to prohibit the placing of blame on the other parent in a manner that harms the Children’s relationship with either parent;

8. Order such additional terms regarding communication, scheduling, and dispute-resolution as the Court deems just and proper to protect the Children’s emotional and physical well-being;

9. Award the Plaintiff her costs associated with this action as permitted by law; and

10. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the minor Children.
