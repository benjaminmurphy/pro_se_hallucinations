                      COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
                  (NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY/FIRE)

Plaintiff Jessica Thomas (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Lynnwood Apartments, Inc. (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

                                   PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thomas is an individual who, at all times relevant to this Complaint, resided on the third floor of the residential apartment building located at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Lynnwood Apartments, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation, with its principal place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled the residential apartment building located at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905 (“the Property” or “the Building”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant, directly or through its officers, employees, agents, and/or contractors, acted as landlord of the Building and was responsible for the maintenance, repair, and safety of the common areas and common systems, including smoke detection and fire safety equipment.

                       JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action sounds in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, and the applicable jurisdictional provisions governing civil actions in the District Court Department, because the damages claimed are within the monetary jurisdiction of the Lynn Division of the District Court Department.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 & 2, because the cause of action arose in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts, and the Property owned, managed, and/or controlled by Defendant is located at 150 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

7. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is a Massachusetts corporation and/or regularly conducts business in Massachusetts and in Essex County, and because the acts and omissions complained of occurred within this Commonwealth.

                             STATEMENT OF FACTS

8. On or about September 12, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful residential tenant of the Building, occupying an apartment on the third floor immediately adjacent to a common hallway.

9. Defendant, as landlord and owner/manager of the Building, owed all tenants, including Plaintiff, a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the common areas of the Building, including common hallways and life-safety systems, in a reasonably safe condition. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).

10. The common hallway directly outside Plaintiff’s unit was equipped with a smoke detector intended to provide early warning of fire or smoke conditions to occupants of the third floor, including Plaintiff.

11. For an extended period of months before September 12, 2023, the smoke detector in the third-floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit emitted intermittent “chirping” sounds, indicating a low or failing battery.

12. Eventually, an unknown person, in an apparent attempt to silence the detector, removed the battery from the smoke detector and left the battery sitting on the nearby hallway windowsill.

13. From the time the battery was removed until the date of the fire, the common hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment was nonfunctional and incapable of detecting smoke or providing audible warning of smoke or fire conditions to the tenants on the third floor.

14. Plaintiff personally observed the low-battery chirping condition and, subsequently, the complete lack of a battery in the smoke detector.

15. Plaintiff notified Defendant and/or Defendant’s agents or representatives of the defective condition of the common hallway smoke detector at least three separate times over the course of several months prior to September 12, 2023.

16. During those communications, Plaintiff explained that the detector was first chirping and later was missing a battery and not functioning.

17. Each time, Defendant and/or Defendant’s agents told Plaintiff that they would “take care of it” or words to that effect, thereby acknowledging notice of the condition and assuming responsibility for addressing it.

18. Despite these multiple complaints and assurances, Defendant failed to repair, replace, or otherwise restore the proper operation of the smoke detector in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit before September 12, 2023.

19. At all relevant times, Defendant had actual notice of the defective and inoperative smoke detector, as well as constructive notice based on the length of time the detector was chirping and then left without a battery in a highly visible and accessible common hallway.

20. On the night of September 12, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment in the Building, believed to have started in the kitchen area.

21. As the fire developed, smoke and fire gases traveled from the first floor to the upper floors, including the third floor, through common areas and stairwells.

22. Because the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s third-floor unit had no battery and was not operational, no audible smoke alarm sounded in the third-floor common hallway.

23. Plaintiff received no early smoke or fire warning by way of the third-floor hallway detector and thus had no timely notice of the dangerous fire conditions developing in the Building.

24. Plaintiff first became aware that something was wrong only when she personally smelled smoke inside her apartment.

25. By the time Plaintiff noticed the smell of smoke and exited her apartment into the hallway, the third-floor hallway and stairwell were already thick with smoke, substantially reducing visibility and making it difficult to breathe.

26. Plaintiff was forced to navigate the smoke-filled hallway and stairwell to evacuate the Building without the benefit of any early warning or additional time that would have been provided by a properly functioning smoke detector.

27. During her effort to escape the Building, Plaintiff inhaled significant quantities of smoke and experienced acute breathing difficulties, chest tightness, coughing, and distress.

28. Plaintiff ultimately managed to exit the Building but required emergency medical evaluation and treatment due to smoke inhalation and related respiratory issues.

29. Plaintiff was transported to and treated at a hospital emergency department, where she received oxygen and other care for smoke inhalation and difficulty breathing, and she remained under observation overnight.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the smoke detector in working condition with a functioning battery, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries including smoke inhalation, respiratory distress, and difficulty breathing.

31. Plaintiff’s injuries required medical treatment, and her medical expenses to date are approximately Five Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($5,200.00).

32. Plaintiff’s injuries and hospitalization also caused her to miss work and lose approximately One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) in wages.

33. In addition to her personal injuries, Plaintiff’s personal property in her apartment, including furniture, clothing, electronics, and other household items, was damaged by smoke, soot, and water from the firefighting efforts.

34. Plaintiff has incurred and will continue to incur expenses related to cleaning, repairing, or replacing her damaged personal property.

35. Plaintiff has also suffered pain and suffering, fear, anxiety, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the fire and her injuries.

36. The condition of the common hallway smoke detector, including its lack of a functioning battery, was open and obvious to Defendant’s agents or employees who had access to the common areas and bore responsibility for their maintenance and safety.

37. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known, that a nonfunctioning smoke detector in a multi-unit residential building posed a serious and unreasonable risk of harm to tenants, including Plaintiff, in the event of a fire.

38. Defendant had a non-delegable duty to provide and maintain required smoke detectors and fire safety equipment in the common areas of the Building, in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, building and fire codes, and the common law duty of reasonable care.

39. At all times relevant, Plaintiff was a lawful tenant and not comparatively negligent in any manner that caused or contributed to the fire or to the inoperative condition of the smoke detector.

40. Any negligence of third parties, including the tenant where the fire originated or any unknown person who may have removed the battery, does not relieve Defendant of its independent duty to maintain safe common areas and to properly inspect and maintain smoke detection devices, nor does it break the chain of causation between Defendant’s negligence and Plaintiff’s injuries.

41. The harms and injuries suffered by Plaintiff were the reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to maintain the smoke detector in working order and to respond reasonably to Plaintiff’s repeated reports of the defective life-safety device.

                     DUTIES OWED UNDER MASSACHUSETTS LAW

42. Under Massachusetts common law, a landlord owes a duty of reasonable care to tenants and lawful occupants with respect to the condition of common areas the landlord controls. Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).

43. This duty extends to the maintenance of building safety systems, including smoke detectors and other fire safety equipment, where such systems are under the landlord’s control and are intended for the protection of tenants. See Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162, 167–70 (1980).

44. A landlord must exercise reasonable care to inspect and repair dangerous conditions in common areas that the landlord knows about or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should know about. See Lindsey v. Massios, 372 Mass. 79, 82 (1977).

45. A landlord who has actual or constructive notice of a defect in a common area has a duty to repair that defect within a reasonable time and may be held liable for injuries proximately caused by the failure to do so. See Falden v. Gordon, 333 Mass. 135, 137 (1955); Crowell v. McCaffrey, 377 Mass. 443, 451 (1979).

46. Defendant also had obligations arising under Massachusetts statutes and regulations regarding fire and building safety, including but not limited to:

    a. G.L. c. 148, § 26F (requiring automatic smoke or heat detectors in certain residential buildings and imposing duties on owners to install and maintain such devices);

    b. G.L. c. 143, §§ 3, 3T, and related provisions (governing building safety and enforcement of building codes);

    c. The State Building Code, 780 CMR, including provisions adopting NFPA 72 (National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code) and requiring the installation and maintenance of smoke detection systems in multi-unit residential occupancies;

    d. The State Fire Code, 527 CMR and 527 CMR 1.00, including provisions requiring maintenance of fire protection and detection systems in an operable condition.

47. While a violation of a statute, regulation, or building/fire code is not per se negligence, such violations may constitute evidence of negligence and of the standard of reasonable care under Massachusetts law. Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990); LaClair v. Silberline Mfg. Co., 379 Mass. 21, 28 (1979).

48. As owner and landlord of the Building, Defendant was required by G.L. c. 148, § 26F, and applicable fire and building codes to install and maintain operable smoke detectors in the common areas of the Building, including the third-floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment.

49. Under Massachusetts law, where a landlord retains control over a building system or common area for the benefit and safety of tenants, the landlord is liable if it fails to act with reasonable care in maintaining that system and such failure causes foreseeable injury. See King v. G & M Realty Corp., 373 Mass. 658, 662–63 (1977); Piekos v. Bachand, 333 Mass. 211, 213–14 (1955).

50. Defendant’s above-described conduct, including its failure to remedy the non-functional smoke detector despite actual notice, constitutes a breach of its legal duties under Massachusetts common law and applicable statutes and regulations.

                                COUNT I  
                           NEGLIGENCE (ONLY CLAIM)

51. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 50 as if fully set forth herein.

52. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the common areas of the Building, including the third-floor hallway and its smoke detector, in a reasonably safe condition, and to comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and codes designed to protect tenants from fire-related harm.

53. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to the following negligent acts and omissions:

    a. Failing to maintain the third-floor hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit in a functioning and operable condition;

    b. Failing to ensure that the smoke detector contained a working battery and was capable of detecting smoke and sounding an alarm;

    c. Failing to timely inspect the common areas and smoke detector after receiving notice that the detector was chirping because of a low battery and later that it was non-functional;

    d. Failing to repair, replace, or otherwise correct the inoperative smoke detector within a reasonable time after receiving actual notice of its defective condition from Plaintiff;

    e. Failing to implement reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that common-area life-safety equipment, including smoke detectors, was regularly inspected, maintained, and promptly repaired;

    f. Failing to comply with G.L. c. 148, § 26F, and applicable building and fire code requirements (including 780 CMR and 527 CMR) mandating functional smoke detection devices in residential common areas;

    g. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other tenants of the absence or non-functioning condition of the hallway smoke detector and the increased risk of harm in the event of a fire;

    h. Failing to act as a reasonably prudent landlord/owner of a multi-unit residential building in maintaining fire safety systems and responding to tenant complaints.

54. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

55. The absence of a functioning smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit deprived Plaintiff of timely warning of the fire, delayed her awareness and evacuation, and caused her to encounter substantially greater smoke conditions than she would have faced had the smoke detector been operational.

56. The injuries suffered by Plaintiff, including smoke inhalation and related physical and emotional harms, were the reasonably foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain operable smoke detection equipment in a residential building and to respond to multiple complaints about the detector’s condition.

57. Defendant’s negligence need not be the sole cause of Plaintiff’s injuries; it is sufficient under Massachusetts law that Defendant’s conduct was a substantial contributing factor in producing Plaintiff’s injuries. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983).

58. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain the following damages:

    a. Physical injury, including smoke inhalation and related respiratory problems;

    b. Pain and suffering, physical discomfort, and limitations in usual activities;

    c. Emotional distress, anxiety, fear, and loss of enjoyment of life;

    d. Past medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,200.00, and reasonable and necessary future medical expenses as may be incurred;

    e. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000.00;

    f. Loss of earning capacity to the extent her injuries impact future work;

    g. Damage to personal property, including but not limited to clothing, furniture, electronics, and other items damaged by smoke and water;

    h. Other incidental and consequential damages and out-of-pocket costs.

59. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover full and fair compensation for all injuries proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. See Haddad v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 455 Mass. 91, 107 (2009); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 787 (1975).

60. To the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff denies that she was negligent in any respect. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any such negligence would be less than that of Defendant and would only proportionally reduce, but not bar, her recovery.

61. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint, including the amount of damages sought, as discovery and additional information become available.

                             PRAYER FOR RELIEF
