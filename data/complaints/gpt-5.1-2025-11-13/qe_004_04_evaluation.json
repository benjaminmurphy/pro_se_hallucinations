It holds that such omissions, despite attempted but ineffectual repairs, constitute a violation of \u00a7 14 because they foreseeably and substantially impaired the value of the leased premises as a dwelling. This directly supports the proposition that failure to remedy materially impairing conditions after notice and over time breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cCruz Management had notice of numerous sanitary, building and fire code violations in the apartment leased by Thomas. It was wholly foreseeable (in fact, it was inevitable) that the failure adequately to correct these violations, which included inadequate heat and hot water and a serious infestation of vermin, would impair substantially the value of the leased premises as a dwelling place for Thomas and her family. On the facts found by the judge a violation of \u00a7 14 has been shown.\u201d"

It does not discuss landlord\u2013tenant law, residential conditions, habitability, or the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Accordingly, it cannot serve as authority for the proposition that a landlord\u2019s failure to remedy materially impairing conditions constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, confers broad discretion on a judge in awarding alimony and making equitable property divisions. \u2026 The purpose of an award of alimony is to provide economic support to a dependent spouse. \u2026 The purpose of a property division is to recognize and equitably recompense the parties\u2019 respective contributions to the marital partnership. \u2026 An order to convey property in lieu of alimony past, present, and future is, in our opinion, inappropriate under most circumstances and constitutes an abuse of discretion here."
