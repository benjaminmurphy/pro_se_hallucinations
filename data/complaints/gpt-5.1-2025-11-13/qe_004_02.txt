MICHAEL SMITH,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Michael Smith (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 45 Brook Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (“the Premises”).

2. Defendant Michael Smith is an individual who, on information and belief, owns and/or controls and manages the residential rental property located at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action arising out of a residential landlord‑tenant relationship located in Worcester, Massachusetts, involving claims under G.L. c. 186.

4. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court, Housing Court Department, pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because the real property that is the subject of this action is located in Worcester, Massachusetts, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for a residential apartment at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, with Defendant as landlord.

6. Plaintiff’s tenancy is and at all relevant times has been a residential tenancy subject to G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and to the implied warranty of habitability under Massachusetts law. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

7. Plaintiff’s current rent is $1,200 per month, payable to Defendant.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant had care, custody, control, and responsibility for maintenance of the building and common structural systems, and for providing an apartment fit for human habitation, including freedom from rodent infestation, as required by the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., and G.L. c. 111, § 127A.

9. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code expressly requires that every dwelling be kept “free from infestation of rodents, skunks, cockroaches, and insect pests,” 105 CMR 410.550, and imposes on owners a duty to “exterminate and prevent infestation” where it exists in a dwelling containing more than one unit. See 105 CMR 410.550–410.560.

10. Approximately three months before the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff began to notice mouse droppings in her kitchen, including on countertops, in cabinets, and near food storage areas.

11. Upon discovering the mouse droppings, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent problem verbally and/or in writing, fulfilling her duty to notify the landlord of conditions requiring repair. See McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977).

12. After Plaintiff’s initial complaint, Defendant provided a few mouse traps in the Premises. Only approximately two mice were caught, and the presence of droppings continued.

13. The infestation was not abated. Plaintiff continued to find fresh mouse droppings in her kitchen on a regular basis, including multiple times per week.

14. Plaintiff maintains her apartment in a clean and sanitary condition, including promptly cleaning surfaces, storing food appropriately, and taking out trash regularly. Plaintiff disputes Defendant’s implication that her housekeeping has caused or contributed to the infestation.

15. Defendant told Plaintiff that the mouse problem was “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff needed to keep her kitchen cleaner, effectively placing blame on Plaintiff rather than addressing the underlying infestation in the building.

16. Defendant arranged for a single visit by an exterminator. The exterminator advised, in substance, that the building likely required more comprehensive and ongoing treatment to address the rodent problem effectively.

17. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for additional extermination or comprehensive building treatment, stating that such measures were “overkill” and “too expensive,” despite the exterminator’s recommendation and Plaintiff’s continued complaints.

18. After the exterminator’s single visit and Defendant’s refusal to take further appropriate action, rodents and/or mouse droppings continued to appear regularly in Plaintiff’s kitchen, indicating that the infestation persisted.

19. Plaintiff has been forced to discard food items in boxes and bags that were not fully sealed, including cereal, rice, pasta, snacks, baking supplies, and other pantry staples, due to the risk of contamination from rodent droppings and urine.

20. Over the past several months, Plaintiff has reasonably had to throw away approximately $200 worth of food that was contaminated or reasonably feared to be contaminated.

21. To protect remaining food from contamination, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers and related supplies at her own expense, incurring approximately $80 in costs.

22. As a result of the continuing rodent infestation and Defendant’s refusal to take adequate steps to abate it, Plaintiff has suffered significant interference with the use and enjoyment of her kitchen and apartment, including:

   a. Inability to safely store and prepare food without fear of contamination;  
   b. Ongoing anxiety and distress about health and safety;  
   c. Loss of value of the apartment as a habitable residence; and  
   d. Economic losses for food and supplies reasonably discarded or purchased.

23. Plaintiff’s cooking and eating in her home have been substantially disrupted. She reasonably fears illness from exposure to rodent droppings, urine, and potential disease.

24. Rodent infestations, including the presence of droppings in food preparation and storage areas, are conditions that materially impair the health, safety, and well‑being of occupants and constitute a violation of the State Sanitary Code. See 105 CMR 410.550; see also Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).

25. By reason of the ongoing rodent infestation and the landlord’s failure to properly remediate the condition, Plaintiff’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the Premises has been substantially and unreasonably interfered with.

26. Defendant’s failure to act adequately constitutes a breach of his statutory and common‑law obligations as landlord, including his duty not to interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, and interpreted in cases such as Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994), and Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

27. Plaintiff has remained current in the payment of rent during the relevant time period or has otherwise substantially performed her obligations as tenant, and any minor non‑performance is not material or related to the rodent conditions complained of.

28. Despite notice of the infestation and its continuation over a period of months, Defendant has refused to implement the comprehensive extermination and building repairs reasonably necessary to abate the condition, and has instead minimized the problem and blamed Plaintiff.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, Plaintiff has incurred monetary damages of at least $280, consisting of approximately $200 in spoiled and discarded food and approximately $80 in replacement food storage and related supplies, as well as the loss of value of the apartment’s use and enjoyment during the relevant time period.

30. Plaintiff reserves the right to prove at trial additional consequential damages, including but not limited to diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises during the period of infestation and emotional distress associated with the unsanitary and unsafe conditions. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979).

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

31. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every landlord is prohibited from “directly or indirectly” interfering with the quiet enjoyment of a residential tenant, and may be held liable for actual and statutory damages where such interference occurs.

33. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is an express statutory right and an implied term of every residential lease in Massachusetts. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

34. Interference with quiet enjoyment does not require that the landlord act with malice or an intent to harm; it is sufficient that the landlord’s acts or failures to act, after notice, cause a serious and substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994).

35. Substantial violations of the State Sanitary Code that persist after the landlord has notice have been held to constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).

36. Rodent infestations, particularly in kitchens and food preparation areas, endanger the health and safety of occupants and constitute substantial interferences with tenants’ use of their dwellings, and, when not adequately remedied by the landlord, breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994); see also 105 CMR 410.550–410.560.

37. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation for at least several months before this action, through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and the exterminator’s assessment.

38. Despite such notice, Defendant failed and refused to take reasonable steps to abate the infestation, including failing to:

   a. Implement the comprehensive extermination plan recommended by the exterminator;  
   b. Arrange for follow‑up visits and treatment;  
   c. Inspect and seal entry points and structural defects allowing rodents access; and  
   d. Otherwise maintain the Premises in a condition compliant with the State Sanitary Code.

39. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, after having notice of the rodent infestation, constitute an “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for indirect interference); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

40. The continuing rodent infestation and contamination of Plaintiff’s kitchen and food are substantial interferences that a reasonable person would find seriously impair the character and value of the tenancy. See Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994).

41. Defects that “materially impair the health or safety” of tenants and are not timely corrected by the landlord after notice may also demonstrate a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, evidencing the seriousness of the conditions underlying the quiet enjoyment claim. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977).

42. By reason of Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including:

   a. Out‑of‑pocket expenses of at least $280 (spoiled food and replacement storage supplies);  
   b. Loss of the fair rental value of the Premises during the period of infestation; and  
   c. Emotional distress, discomfort, and anxiety resulting from persistent unsanitary and unsafe conditions in her home.

43. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for (a) actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is self‑represented and not presently claiming attorneys’ fees, she is entitled at minimum to her actual damages and any enhanced statutory damages the Court deems appropriate. See Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

44. Defendant’s failure to remedy these conditions after notice is willful or, at a minimum, in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory rights and health and safety, justifying an award of the maximum statutory damages available under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

---

### V. DAMAGES

45. Plaintiff has suffered actual monetary damages in the approximate amount of $280, representing:

   a. Approximately $200 in spoiled and discarded food contaminated or reasonably suspected of being contaminated by rodent droppings or urine; and  
   b. Approximately $80 in plastic containers and related items purchased to protect food from further contamination.

46. In addition, Plaintiff has suffered non‑economic harm, including anxiety, fear of illness, and loss of enjoyment of daily life activities such as cooking and eating in her own home.

47. Plaintiff seeks recovery of her actual damages, and, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, the greater of her actual damages or three months’ rent, as well as costs of this action.

48. At a monthly rent of $1,200, three months’ rent equals $3,600; Plaintiff seeks at least this amount as statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, subject to the Court’s determination.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Michael Smith and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, by failing to adequately remedy the rodent infestation and associated unsanitary and unsafe conditions at the Premises;

B. An award of actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but no less than $280, representing Plaintiff’s out‑of‑pocket losses and other consequential damages resulting from Defendant’s breach;

C. An award of statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, of at least three months’ rent (presently $3,600) or such greater amount as the Court deems just and proper under the statute;

D. An award of court costs and allowable expenses incurred in bringing this action, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable law;

E. Injunctive and/or equitable relief, if necessary, requiring Defendant to take all steps required by the State Sanitary Code and applicable law to abate the rodent infestation and maintain the Premises in a safe and sanitary condition;

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
