DANIEL PARKER,  
    Defendant / Respondent.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)


NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Matthews (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Matthews, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Emily Parker and Jacob Parker.

2. The Defendant, Daniel Parker (“Father”), upon information and belief resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, 29, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as well as the Court’s general equity and parens patriae powers regarding the custody and welfare of minor children.

4. On or about May 15, 2021, the Bristol Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary/Final Order) concerning custody and parenting time of the minor children, Emily Parker (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Jacob Parker (date of birth: __________, age 6) (the “2021 Custody Order”).

5. Under the 2021 Custody Order, the parties share legal custody, with the Mother having primary physical custody. The Father is granted parenting time including:  
   a. Overnight parenting time every other weekend; and  
   b. One overnight parenting time during the week.

6. Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court, as this Court issued the 2021 Custody Order and the parties and children reside within its jurisdiction.

### II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

7. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify orders relative to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require,” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the children.

8. Massachusetts law provides that the best interests of the child are paramount in any custody or parenting-time determination. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003).

9. A court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time order where a material and substantial change in circumstances, not contemplated at the time of the prior judgment, affects the children’s welfare. See, e.g., Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 293–94 (2009); Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 681–82 (2016).

10. In assessing the best interests of the child, the Court considers, among other factors, the child’s welfare, stability, safety, and the ability and availability of each parent to meet the child’s needs. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575, 580–81 (2007); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 766–67 (1983).

11. Where a parent’s work schedule or living arrangements substantially change so as to interfere with the existing parenting plan, this may constitute a material change justifying modification. See, e.g., Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 184–86 (2006) (noting significance of parental availability and stability to best interests); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–39 (1996) (material changes affecting child’s routine and care can warrant modification).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since the entry of the 2021 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in the Father’s circumstances that significantly affects his ability to exercise the existing overnight parenting schedule safely and consistently.

13. At the time the 2021 Custody Order was entered, both parents worked regular daytime jobs, and the existing schedule—overnights every other weekend plus one overnight during the week—was structured on the understanding that the Father would be rested and available during his parenting time.

14. Recently, and well after the entry of the 2021 Custody Order, the Father accepted a new job requiring him to work from approximately 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. on multiple nights per week.

15. The Father’s new overnight work schedule includes many of the nights that coincide with his scheduled overnight parenting time under the 2021 Custody Order.

16. As a result of his new overnight schedule, when the Father is supposed to have the children overnight, he is often either:  
    a. Actively at work during a substantial portion of that scheduled overnight parenting time; or  
    b. Returning from a 12‑hour overnight shift and is extremely fatigued, to the point that he is not reasonably able to supervise the children safely.

17. On multiple occasions, the Father has, on short notice, unilaterally dropped the children off at the Mother’s residence during his scheduled overnights because he has stated that he is “too tired” to care for them after his work shift.

18. These last‑minute drop‑offs have occurred with little or no advance communication or planning, disrupting the children’s routines and causing confusion and instability in their schedules.

19. On other occasions, when the Father has attempted to exercise his overnight parenting time, he has left the children in the care of his roommate, an individual whom the Mother barely knows and did not agree to as a regular caretaker.

20. Upon information and belief, the roommate is not a close family member, licensed caregiver, or other previously‑approved caretaker, and the Mother has insufficient information about this person’s background, parenting abilities, or suitability for unsupervised care of the minor children overnight.

21. The children have reported to the Mother that when they are at the Father’s home, they frequently fall asleep on the couch while the Father is napping or sleeping after returning from his overnight shift.

22. The children’s statements indicate that, at times, there is inadequate structured supervision, inconsistent bedtime routines, and a lack of stable sleeping arrangements at the Father’s residence when he is tired or recovering from overnight work.

23. The Father’s new work schedule, his frequent inability to personally care for the children during his designated overnight time, and his reliance on an essentially unknown third party (his roommate) to supervise the children overnight represent circumstances materially different from those that existed when the 2021 Custody Order was entered.

24. The current overnight schedule, when combined with the Father’s 7 P.M. to 7 A.M. shifts, results in the children either:  
    a. Being left in the care of an unrelated adult whom the Mother does not know well and did not agree to;  
    b. Being dropped off with the Mother without notice, undermining the predictability of the parenting plan; or  
    c. Being in the Father’s care while he is overly fatigued from overnight work, impairing his ability to safely supervise them.

25. These circumstances materially and substantially affect the children’s welfare, safety, and stability, and were not contemplated at the time of the 2021 Custody Order.

26. The Mother has continued to provide the children with stable primary physical care, including consistent school attendance, regular routines, and safe supervision during her parenting time.

27. By contrast, the Father’s present reality—frequent late‑night or early‑morning transitions, unplanned hand‑offs, and inconsistent personal availability—creates instability that is contrary to the children’s best interests.

28. Under Massachusetts law, the Court has both the authority and the obligation to adjust parenting time orders to conform to the children’s current needs and to ensure their safety and stability when a material change occurs. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 681–82; Mason, 447 Mass. at 184–86.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

29. The children, Emily (8) and Jacob (6), are school‑age and require consistent routines, adequate rest, regular bedtime schedules, and reliable, alert adult supervision, particularly on school nights and evenings.

30. The Father’s current practice of working overnight shifts that overlap with his scheduled parenting time, coupled with his extreme fatigue during periods when he is supposed to be caring for the children, undermines these basic needs.

31. The frequent last‑minute changes in who is caring for the children—whether the Father, his roommate, or the Mother hurriedly taking over—create confusion and anxiety for the children and are not consistent with the stability that Massachusetts law seeks to promote for minors. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43 (emphasizing continuity and stability); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26 (child’s stability and continuity of care are central to best‑interests analysis).

32. The Mother is available and able to care for the children on the overnights when the Father is working, and she has in fact been doing so repeatedly whenever he has dropped them off or failed to be available.

33. Allowing overnights only when the Father is genuinely off work and capable of personally supervising and engaging with the children would preserve their relationship with him while aligning parenting time with his actual availability and the children’s best interests.

34. The relief requested herein does not seek to interfere with the Father’s relationship with the children; instead, it seeks to reasonably adjust the schedule to:  
    a. Reflect the Father’s new overnight work schedule;  
    b. Minimize unplanned transitions; and  
    c. Ensure that when the children are in the Father’s care overnight, he is rested, present, and able to supervise them appropriately.

35. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific material changes—namely, the Father’s 7 P.M. to 7 A.M. work schedule and the resulting safety and stability concerns—while maintaining his meaningful role in the children’s lives, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and cases such as Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 184–86, and Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. at 711.

36. Accordingly, modifying the current custody/parenting time order to limit overnights to those nights when the Father is actually off work and available to care for the children is in the best interests of Emily and Jacob.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

37. The Plaintiff does not seek to change legal custody or to terminate the Father’s relationship with the children, but rather to modify the parenting time schedule to reflect the parties’ current circumstances and the best interests of the children.

38. The Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the 2021 Custody Order as follows:

   a. The Mother, Laura Matthews, shall remain the primary physical custodian of the minor children, with shared legal custody continuing as previously ordered (unless otherwise ordered by the Court).

   b. The Father’s overnight parenting time shall be modified so that the Father shall have overnight visits with the children only on nights when he is not scheduled to work overnight (i.e., not working 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M., or substantially similar overnight hours).

   c. The every‑other‑weekend parenting time may remain in effect, provided that any overnights occur only when the Father is actually off from overnight work and able to be present and responsible for the children.

   d. The mid‑week overnight parenting time shall be modified to a mid‑week, non‑overnight visit (for example, after‑school or evening parenting time) unless and until the Father’s work schedule changes such that he is consistently available, rested, and not working overnight on that evening, and only upon further order of the Court or agreement of the parties.

   e. The Father shall provide the Mother at least forty‑eight (48) hours’ notice when he is unable to exercise his scheduled parenting time due to work or fatigue related to his overnight shift, except in bona fide emergencies, so as to minimize last‑minute disruptions.

   f. The Father shall not routinely delegate his overnight parenting time to unrelated third parties (such as roommates or friends) without the Mother’s prior consent or prior order of the Court, recognizing that brief, incidental childcare (e.g., a short period with a babysitter) may be reasonable, but regular overnight care by an unrelated third party is not consistent with the intent of the parenting plan.

   g. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to communicate and adjust the schedule in good faith around the Father’s confirmed work roster, but any such adjustments must maintain the children’s safety, rest, and stability as a primary consideration.

   h. Any additional or clarifying orders the Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor children.

39. The requested changes are based upon a substantial and material change in circumstances since the 2021 Custody Order, specifically the Father’s overnight work schedule and its impact on the existing overnight parenting arrangement, and are necessary to protect the welfare and best interests of the minor children, in accordance with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and relevant case law including Custody of Vaughn, Mason v. Coleman, Custody of Kali, Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, Adoption of Hugo, and others cited above.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Matthews, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and determine that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, specifically due to the Father’s new overnight work schedule and its effects on his ability to exercise overnight parenting time safely and consistently.

2. Find and determine that it is in the best interests of the minor children, Emily Parker and Jacob Parker, that the current parenting time schedule be modified to ensure that overnights occur only when the Father is not working overnight and is reasonably rested and available to supervise the children.

3. Issue a modified order providing that:  
   a. The Mother shall remain the primary physical custodian, with shared legal custody continuing as previously ordered unless otherwise modified by the Court;  
   b. The Father’s overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when he is not scheduled for or working an overnight shift (e.g., 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. or similar);  
   c. The Father’s mid‑week overnight shall be converted to a non‑overnight mid‑week visit, or otherwise adjusted, consistent with his actual availability and the children’s school and sleep schedules; and  
   d. The parties shall follow reasonable notice and child‑care provisions as set forth above, or as the Court may further define, to minimize last‑minute disruptions and reliance on unrelated third‑party caregivers for regular overnight care.

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor children.

Respectfully submitted,

LAURA MATTHEWS,
