COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)  
_______________________________  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff, Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant, James Thompson (“Defendant”), is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns and/or controls and acts as landlord for the residential rental property located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. This is an action by a residential tenant against her landlord for breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14, arising out of Defendant’s failure to provide hot water at the Premises for an extended period of time.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§19–21 and G.L. c. 223 because the Premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Brockton, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limit of this Court.

5. Plaintiff brings this action as a residential tenant entitled to the protections of G.L. c. 186, §14 and related landlord–tenant statutes and common law.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, with Defendant as landlord.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises as her primary residence from on or about May 1, 2022, through the present.

8. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00 to Defendant for the Premises.

9. As a residential landlord in Massachusetts, Defendant is required by statute and regulation to provide hot water and to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. See G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.190, 410.200.

10. The State Sanitary Code provides that the owner shall provide and maintain facilities for heating water and that hot water must be supplied in quantities and at temperatures specified by regulation. See 105 C.M.R. 410.190–410.200 (requiring hot water at not less than 110°F at every required kitchen sink, lavatory, and bathtub or shower).

11. Massachusetts law recognizes that a lack of hot water is a serious violation of the State Sanitary Code and materially affects the habitability of residential premises. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 201–02 (1979); Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973).

12. Approximately three weeks before December 1, 2025, on or about November 10, 2025, the hot water service in Plaintiff’s apartment stopped functioning, and Plaintiff ceased to have any hot water in her unit.

13. Plaintiff discovered that she had no hot water in her apartment and, on that same day, promptly notified Defendant of the problem by text message and/or other communication.

14. Upon being notified, Defendant informed Plaintiff that the water heater needed a part that he had ordered and that repairs would be made when the part arrived.

15. Despite this representation, one week later Plaintiff still had no hot water in her apartment.

16. When Plaintiff again contacted Defendant about the continued lack of hot water, Defendant told Plaintiff that the part for the water heater was on backorder and that he was still “working on it.”

17. After another week had passed, Plaintiff still had no hot water and again contacted Defendant, who gave substantially the same response and did not provide a definite date by which hot water service would be restored.

18. As of December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water in her apartment for approximately three weeks, and the condition remains uncorrected.

19. Throughout this time, Plaintiff has been compelled to take cold showers in her apartment and to boil water to wash dishes and for other household uses.

20. Because bathing in cold water is uncomfortable and difficult, Plaintiff has obtained a gym membership at a cost of approximately $30.00 per month solely to have access to hot showers away from the Premises.

21. Plaintiff has also incurred additional costs in gasoline and travel time driving to and from the gym to shower because of the lack of hot water in her apartment.

22. Plaintiff has a baby, and the absence of hot water has made it unsafe and impractical to bathe her baby in the apartment.

23. To ensure her baby can be safely bathed, Plaintiff has had to take her baby to her mother’s house for baths, causing further inconvenience, time, and transportation expenses, and disruption to Plaintiff’s daily life and caregiving routines.

24. The lack of hot water for an extended period has significantly interfered with the ordinary and reasonable use of the Premises as a residence and has caused Plaintiff to suffer substantial discomfort, inconvenience, and disruption in her daily life.

25. Defendant has at all relevant times been responsible for providing and maintaining hot water in compliance with the State Sanitary Code at the Premises.

26. Defendant has not provided Plaintiff with any alternative arrangements for hot water at the Premises, any reduction or abatement in rent, or any reasonable accommodation for the loss of this essential service.

27. Although Defendant has periodically responded to Plaintiff’s text messages and has asserted that he is attempting to obtain a replacement part, Defendant has failed to promptly and reasonably remedy the lack of hot water.

28. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s liability for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment does not depend on the landlord’s good faith or intent but rather on whether the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

29. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment where there is a serious and persistent deficiency in an essential service, such as heat or hot water, that substantially impairs the character and value of the leased premises. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977).

30. By failing for approximately three weeks (and continuing) to provide hot water, an essential service required by the State Sanitary Code, after notice of the problem, Defendant has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14.

31. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water over this extended period constitutes a violation of G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127L and 105 C.M.R. 410.190–410.200, and such State Sanitary Code violations are recognized as grounds for liability for breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14. See, e.g., Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Berman, 379 Mass. at 201–02.

32. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that persistent conditions depriving tenants of essential services, including heat and hot water, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 787–89 (1994); Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 748–50 (2005); Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–200.

33. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has paid, or stood ready and willing to pay, her monthly rent of $1,200.00, despite the significant interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises.

34. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to:

  a. Loss of the use and enjoyment of essential hot water in her home for approximately three weeks (and continuing);  
  b. Out-of-pocket expenses for a gym membership obtained solely to access hot showers ($30.00 per month and associated travel costs);  
  c. Additional travel, time, and inconvenience in transporting herself and her baby to other locations for bathing;  
  d. Discomfort, inconvenience, and interference with daily living and childcare caused by the absence of hot water; and  
  e. A partial loss in the fair rental value of the Premises during the period in which no hot water has been available.

35. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has suffered at least $450.00 in actual damages as a result of Defendant’s breach, including rent-based loss of use and out-of-pocket expenses, as of the filing of this Complaint.

36. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Cruz, 417 Mass. at 788–89.

37. Plaintiff seeks at least her actual damages of approximately $450.00, which are less than three months’ rent ($3,600.00), and expressly reserves the right to seek up to the statutory minimum of three months’ rent under G.L. c. 186, §14 should her actual and consequential damages be determined to exceed that amount or otherwise warrant the statutory minimum.

38. Defendant’s failure to timely restore hot water, despite repeated notice and the continuing duration of the condition, is an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home and is a violation of G.L. c. 186, §14 as interpreted by controlling Massachusetts caselaw. See, e.g., Blackett, 371 Mass. at 715–18; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Jablonski, 64 Mass. App. Ct. at 748–50.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, §14)  

39. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 38 as if fully set forth herein.

40. Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “[d]irectly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and imposes liability for violations.

41. The covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14 protects tenants against substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of leased premises, including interference caused by the landlord’s failure to correct serious code violations or to maintain essential services. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Doe, 417 Mass. at 283–84; Cruz, 417 Mass. at 787–89.

42. The failure to supply hot water, as required by the State Sanitary Code, for an extended period constitutes a serious defect materially affecting the habitability of the premises and an actionable interference with quiet enjoyment. See Berman, 379 Mass. at 201–02; Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–200; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

43. Defendant had actual notice of the lack of hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment beginning on or about November 10, 2025, when Plaintiff promptly reported the condition to Defendant.

44. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to restore hot water to the Premises for at least three weeks (and continuing), during which time Plaintiff remained in lawful possession of the Premises and continued to pay or stand ready to pay rent.

45. Defendant’s failure to timely and effectively remedy the lack of hot water, an essential service required by 105 C.M.R. 410.190–410.200, constitutes an omission and neglect that are attributable to Defendant in his capacity as landlord.

46. Defendant’s acts and omissions have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including her ability to bathe herself, to bathe and care for her baby, to wash dishes and maintain sanitation, and to live in reasonable comfort.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, and as interpreted in cases such as Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005), and Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994), Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, regardless of whether Defendant subjectively intended to cause harm or believed he was “working on” the problem.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has sustained actual and consequential damages including, but not limited to, loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, diminished rental value, out-of-pocket expenses, and discomfort and inconvenience, in an amount reasonably estimated to be at least $450.00 as of the filing of this Complaint.

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Although Plaintiff is self-represented at this time, she seeks all statutory remedies available, including costs and, if later applicable, reasonable attorney’s fees.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, James Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, §14 by failing to provide hot water at the Premises for an extended period after notice of the problem;

B. An award of damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $450.00, representing her actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment, diminished rental value, and out-of-pocket expenses, and reserving Plaintiff’s right to seek the statutory minimum of three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14;

C. An order requiring Defendant to immediately restore and maintain compliant hot water service at the Premises in accordance with the State Sanitary Code, G.L. c. 111, §§127A–127L, and 105 C.M.R. 410.190–410.200;

D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14 and other applicable law;

E. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14 in the event Plaintiff later retains counsel and incurs such fees; and

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
