ROBERT WILLIAMS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains of Defendant Robert Williams (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 567 Elm Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

2. Defendant Robert Williams is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental property located at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144 (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, and related Massachusetts common law.

5. The amount in controversy is approximately Two Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($2,400), plus statutory damages, costs, interest, and such further relief as the Court deems just.

6. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 21, because this is a civil action within the jurisdictional limits of the Somerville District Court.

7. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the leased premises are located in Somerville, Middlesex County, and the events giving rise to this claim occurred there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease (the “Lease”) with Defendant for the second‑floor apartment located at 567 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144 (the “Premises”).

9. Under the Lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay, and has paid, monthly rent of $1,800.00 to Defendant.

10. The Lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.

11. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises from on or about January 1, 2022 through the present.

12. Approximately six months prior to the filing of this Complaint, new tenants moved into the third‑floor apartment at 567 Elm Street, which is directly above Plaintiff’s Premises.

13. Since shortly after moving in, the upstairs tenants have routinely engaged in extremely loud and unreasonable noise, including but not limited to:

   a. Heavy stomping and walking at all hours of the day and night;  
   b. Playing loud music late into the night; and  
   c. Moving furniture and causing banging or scraping noises, including around midnight and other late‑night hours.

14. The noise from the upstairs tenants has been frequent, recurrent, and severe, and is plainly audible inside Plaintiff’s bedroom and other areas of her Premises.

15. The pattern of noise regularly continues late into the night and early morning hours, depriving Plaintiff of the ability to sleep and to use and enjoy her Premises in a normal and reasonable manner.

16. Plaintiff has attempted to resolve the problem directly with the upstairs tenants by politely asking them to lower the noise level and to be considerate of quiet hours.

17. After Plaintiff’s initial request, the upstairs tenants were somewhat quieter for approximately one week, but then returned to the same pattern of loud and disruptive behavior.

18. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the excessive noise problem on approximately five or six separate occasions over the past several months.

19. Plaintiff’s complaints to Defendant were made both verbally and, upon information and belief, in writing or via electronic means, and clearly described the timing, frequency, and severity of the noise, and its impact on Plaintiff’s sleep and health.

20. On at least one occasion, Defendant stated that he spoke to the upstairs tenants about the noise but then told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live,” indicating that he would take no meaningful further action.

21. Despite Plaintiff’s multiple complaints, Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable, effective steps within his power as landlord to abate or correct the ongoing noise disturbance.

22. Defendant’s inaction has allowed the excessive and unreasonable noise to continue over an extended period of months.

23. Plaintiff, in an effort to mitigate the impact of the noise, has purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and has rearranged her bedroom to move the bed in an attempt to avoid the loudest areas of impact.

24. These mitigation efforts have been largely unsuccessful, and Plaintiff continues to suffer disrupted sleep and an inability to rest quietly in the Premises.

25. As a result of the persistent and severe noise, Plaintiff has been averaging only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night.

26. Plaintiff’s inability to sleep has negatively affected her work performance. She was issued a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk.

27. Plaintiff’s health has also been adversely affected. Her doctor has prescribed sleep medication, which Plaintiff now must take to manage the sleep disruption caused by the noise.

28. Plaintiff incurs approximately $40 per month in out‑of‑pocket costs for this sleep medication.

29. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, substantial stress, fatigue, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment and comfort of her home as a direct result of the ongoing excessive noise and Defendant’s failure to address it.

30. The noise and disruption experienced by Plaintiff are not isolated or minor inconveniences; they constitute continuing, substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

31. A reasonable tenant in Plaintiff’s position would find such sustained nighttime noise, loss of sleep, health impacts, and employment consequences to be a serious deprivation of the use and enjoyment of the rental premises.

32. Defendant, as the landlord of both Plaintiff and the upstairs tenants, has the ability and legal obligation to take reasonable steps—such as issuing lease enforcement notices, warnings, or initiating tenancy enforcement or eviction proceedings if necessary—to prevent tenants under his control from substantially interfering with other tenants’ quiet enjoyment of their premises.

33. Defendant has failed to take timely or adequate action to resolve the problem after receiving repeated notice from Plaintiff, and has effectively communicated to Plaintiff that he will not do more than he has already done.

34. Defendant’s failure to act, in the face of repeated complaints and evident ongoing harm, constitutes a willful or at least knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the Lease covenant of quiet enjoyment.

35. Plaintiff estimates that, as a result of the Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, she has suffered at least $2,400 in damages, including but not limited to diminished rental value of the Premises, out‑of‑pocket costs (including sleep medication), and consequential damages related to her health and employment.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

36. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully set forth herein.

37. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, both by statute (G.L. c. 186, § 14) and by common law. See, e.g., *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33 (1929).

38. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and statutory damages.

39. Plaintiff’s Lease with Defendant expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises, reflecting and incorporating the statutory and common‑law covenant.

40. The covenant of quiet enjoyment imposes an affirmative duty on a landlord to refrain from conduct, or from allowing conduct within the landlord’s control, that substantially interferes with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 716–718; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–103 (1982).

41. In *Blackett v. Olanoff*, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s failure to control the activities of other tenants or occupants under his control, where those activities substantially interfere with a tenant’s use of the premises, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, even if the landlord does not subjectively intend the interference. 371 Mass. at 717–719.

42. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized that substantial interference with a tenant’s ability to sleep, rest, or use the premises comfortably may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–103 (repeated flooding, noise, and disturbances); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 283–284 (1994).

43. Here, the repeated, excessive, and late‑night noise from the upstairs tenants—stomping, loud music, and furniture moving—has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and to use and enjoy her Premises in a normal way.

44. Defendant is the landlord of both Plaintiff and the upstairs tenants and therefore has control over the tenancies and the power to take reasonable steps to abate the nuisance, including enforcement of lease provisions, warnings, and, if necessary, termination or non‑renewal of the upstairs tenants’ tenancy. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–719; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1979).

45. Defendant was placed on clear notice of the continuing noise problem by Plaintiff’s multiple complaints made over the course of several months.

46. Despite such notice, Defendant has taken minimal, ineffective action and has effectively refused to take further steps, asserting that he “can’t control how people live.”

47. Defendant’s failure and refusal to take reasonable steps within his control to resolve the continuing disturbance, after repeated notice and in the face of ongoing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises, constitutes a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–719; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–104.

48. Under *Blackett* and its progeny, a landlord’s liability for breach of quiet enjoyment does not require proof of malicious intent; it is sufficient that the landlord’s acts or omissions were the natural and probable consequence of conditions he permitted to exist and failed to remedy. 371 Mass. at 718; see also *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–852 (1997).

49. Defendant’s inaction in the face of known, continuing disturbances constitutes at least a knowing and willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to statutory remedies, including up to three months’ rent or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any are incurred). See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–103; *Medeiros v. Bragg*, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 639, 647–648 (2000).

50. Defendant’s breach has caused Plaintiff actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of sleep and rest;  
   b. Emotional distress, stress, anxiety, and loss of comfort;  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket costs for sleep medication (approximately $40/month);  
   d. Diminished value of the Premises as a habitable and reasonably quiet residence compared to the rent paid; and  
   e. Employment‑related consequences, including a written warning for falling asleep at work.

51. Plaintiff’s requested damages of approximately $2,400 represent a reasonable approximation of her actual losses and diminished rental value to date, exclusive of statutory multiples, interest, and costs.

52. Massachusetts law permits a tenant to recover not only consequential damages but also statutory minimum damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for breach of quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. at 199–201; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–104.

53. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is independent of, and in addition to, other tenant protections such as the implied warranty of habitability under G.L. c. 239, § 8A and common law. See *Hemingway v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 184, 194–198 (1973). Plaintiff here asserts only the claim for breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and common law.

54. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of both the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the express and implied covenants of quiet enjoyment contained in the Lease and under Massachusetts common law. See *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929); *Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.*, 340 Mass. 124, 127–128 (1959).

55. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered, and will continue to suffer, damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but in no event less than $2,400, plus statutory damages, interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the statutory and common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the Lease;

E. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

F. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just, proper, and necessary to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises, including but not limited to injunctive relief requiring Defendant to take reasonable steps within his power as landlord to abate and prevent further excessive noise and disturbances.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.
