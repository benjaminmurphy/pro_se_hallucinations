LISA THOMPSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Emma Johnson (date of birth omitted for privacy), age 8.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father of the minor child, Emma Johnson.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody and parenting orders concerning the minor child pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and applicable Massachusetts case law, including *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

4. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the prior custody judgment was issued by this Court and this Court retains continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over custody and parenting time matters affecting the minor child, consistent with M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the principles recognized in *R.W. v. N.W.*, 435 Mass. 708 (2002) and *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

5. On or about January 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment (or Judgment of Divorce/Separation/Parentage Order, as applicable) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child, Emma Johnson (hereafter, the “2019 Judgment”).

6. Under the 2019 Judgment, the Mother was granted primary physical custody of Emma, and the Father was granted parenting time consisting of every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays, with the understanding and factual predicate at that time that both parents resided in the same town and that the distance between their residences and the child’s school was approximately a five-minute drive.

7. The 2019 Judgment and the parenting schedule therein were premised upon the then-existing circumstances, including the parties’ close geographic proximity, which allowed the minor child to maintain a stable, age-appropriate routine on school days.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of Emma Johnson, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law, including *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. 807 (2009), *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 798 (2013), and *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

9. After entry of the 2019 Judgment, the Father relocated his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the minor child’s school and the Mother’s residence.

10. Despite the Father’s relocation, he has continued to insist on exercising the midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time contained in the 2019 Judgment, which was crafted under the assumption of a brief, local commute.

11. Pursuant to the present practice, on Wednesdays the Father picks the minor child up from school, drives her approximately ninety (90) miles to Cape Cod, has her stay overnight, and then wakes her at or around 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings to drive her back the same ninety (90) miles to school.

12. This routine requires the minor child, age 8, to endure long, late-day and early-morning car trips on a school night and a school morning, significantly disrupting her sleep, rest, and normal weekday routine.

13. The minor child’s teacher has reported that Emma is regularly tired and noticeably less engaged in class on Thursdays, and that her participation and attentiveness on Thursdays have declined, which constitutes objective evidence that the current midweek overnight arrangement is adversely impacting her well-being and educational experience.

14. The recurring fatigue, early morning awakenings, and lengthy travel on school days are inconsistent with the minor child’s age, developmental needs, and best interests.

15. The distance between the parties’ residences and the minor child’s school at the time of the 2019 Judgment was de minimis, and the midweek overnight was reasonable and minimally disruptive. The current ninety (90)‑mile commute fundamentally alters the nature and impact of the Wednesday overnight arrangement.

16. The Father’s relocation and the resulting extended midweek commute were not contemplated at the time of the 2019 Judgment and constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, *Schuh v. Schuh*, and *Cooper v. Keto*.

17. Under Massachusetts law, “[m]odification of a custody order is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child.” *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. at 804; see also *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. at 815–816; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262–263 (2001).

18. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that the “best interests of the child” is the paramount consideration in custody and visitation matters. M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–844 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595.

19. In determining best interests, the Court may and should consider the child’s physical health, emotional well-being, stability, and educational needs, among other factors. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 844; *Care & Protection of Reece*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 305 (2001); M.G.L. c. 208, § 31.

20. The current Wednesday overnight schedule, given the Father’s relocation, undermines the minor child’s sleep, stability, and school performance and therefore is no longer consistent with her best interests under M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the case law cited above.

21. A parenting schedule that requires an 8‑year‑old child to wake at approximately 4:30 a.m. on school mornings on a recurring basis is inherently destabilizing and contrary to the child’s physical and educational welfare, and the Court has authority to modify the schedule to avoid such harm. See, e.g., *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. at 804–805 (modification proper where parenting plan no longer serves child’s interests); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 182–183 (2006) (recognizing court’s broad discretion to structure parenting time to promote child’s welfare).

22. The Father’s decision to relocate to Cape Cod and maintain midweek overnights that materially interfere with Emma’s schooling and rest constitutes the type of substantial change in circumstances that justifies modification of parenting time under *Schuh*, *Cooper*, and M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.

23. The requested modification is limited in scope and targeted to address the specific harm caused by the midweek overnight and related weekday travel; it does not seek to eliminate the Father’s relationship with the minor child but to restructure parenting time in a way that is child‑centered and developmentally appropriate.

24. The Mother remains willing to support and promote the Father’s relationship with Emma and to maintain substantial, meaningful parenting time for the Father that does not require extreme early-morning travel on school days.

25. The current schedule, as applied to the Father’s new living situation, has become impracticable and detrimental, and continued enforcement of the Wednesday overnight is inconsistent with the child’s best interests, warranting modification under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. at 545–546; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–263.

26. No prior order of this Court has addressed or resolved the specific issue now presented: whether the Father’s relocation and resulting extreme weekday travel justify elimination or restructuring of the midweek overnight parenting time.

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW

27. M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 provides, in relevant part, that upon a complaint after a divorce judgment and after notice to the other party, the court may “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children … as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

28. M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 articulates the “best interests of the child” standard for custody determinations and authorizes the Court to allocate physical custody and parenting time in a manner that best serves the child’s welfare, stability, and development.

29. Where the parties are unmarried parents, similar authority is granted under M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, permitting modification of custody and visitation orders “as the best interests of the child require.” See *R.D. v. A.H.*, 454 Mass. 706, 710–711 (2009).

30. Massachusetts appellate decisions establish that modification of custody or parenting time requires (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (2) a showing that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. at 814–816; *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. at 804; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. at 544–546; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–263.

31. The Court has broad equitable authority to craft parenting-time schedules that minimize disruption to a child’s routine and support the child’s physical health and educational stability. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–844; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 182–183; *R.W. v. N.W.*, 435 Mass. at 715.

32. Changes in a parent’s residence and the resulting impact on the child’s routine and welfare are properly considered in determining whether a material change has occurred and whether modification is warranted. See *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. at 815–816; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710–712 (1985) (relocation analysis emphasizing child’s interests); *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. at 804–805.

33. Applying these statutes and authorities to the facts alleged herein, there has been a clear, material change in circumstances, and modification of the midweek overnight and related parenting schedule is necessary and appropriate to protect the best interests of Emma Johnson.

### V. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the January 15, 2019 Judgment, primarily arising from the Defendant’s relocation to Cape Cod and the resulting excessive travel and sleep disruption for the minor child on school days.

B. Find and rule that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Emma Johnson, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 (and, if applicable, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20), and consistent with *Schuh v. Schuh*, *Cooper v. Keto*, *Custody of Kali*, *Custody of Vaughn*, and related cases, that the existing parenting-time provisions be modified.

C. Modify the 2019 Judgment to eliminate the Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time during the school year, so that the minor child is not required to travel ninety (90) miles late on a school night and to wake at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings for a return trip to school.

D. Order that, in place of the eliminated midweek overnight, the Father’s parenting time be reasonably adjusted to preserve substantial contact while protecting the child’s weekday routine, for example by:

   1. Providing the Father with alternate or additional weekend parenting time; and/or  

   2. Providing for a midweek dinner visit on Wednesdays (or another weekday), without an overnight, at or near the child’s school or primary residence, at times compatible with the child’s bedtime and school schedule;  

   all as the Court deems just, reasonable, and in the child’s best interests.

E. Clarify that exchanges for any weekday or weeknight parenting time shall occur at times and locations that do not require the minor child to wake at an unreasonably early hour on school mornings or to undertake excessively long drives on school days.

F. Enter such further orders as may be necessary to effectuate the modified parenting schedule in a manner that minimizes disruption to the minor child’s schooling, sleep, and daily routine.

G. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
