COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
_____________________________  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Jessica” or “Plaintiff”), and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This is a Complaint for Modification brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 28A (as applicable to custody and parenting time orders), and the Court’s equitable powers, seeking modification of an existing custody and parenting-time order concerning the minor children, Liam Thompson (date of birth: __________) and Emma Thompson (date of birth: __________).

2. Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, § 6, as the underlying judgment and orders were entered in this Court and the parties and children reside in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. The Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody and parenting-time orders under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, and 31A, and pursuant to the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209B.

### II. PARTIES

4. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Liam Thompson (age 10) and Emma Thompson (age 8).

5. The Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Michael” or “Defendant”), upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor children.

6. The parties are the parents of two minor children:
   - Liam Thompson, age 10; and  
   - Emma Thompson, age 8.

   (Collectively, “the Children”).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / CURRENT ORDER

7. On or about June 15, 2022, this Court entered a judgment and/or order (the “Existing Order”) governing legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the Children.

8. Under the Existing Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31, with the expectation and requirement that the parents consult and share in major decisions concerning the Children’s education, health, and welfare.

9. Under the Existing Order, the Children primarily reside with Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and have parenting time with Defendant, Michael Thompson, on a regular schedule, including every other weekend.

10. The Existing Order also requires that each parent support and foster the Children’s relationship with the other parent, and that neither parent disparage or denigrate the other in the presence of, or within earshot of, the Children.

11. The Existing Order was based upon the facts and circumstances as they existed as of June 15, 2022. Since the entry of that order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the Children, such that the Existing Order is no longer in the Children’s best interests.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since approximately 2024 and continuing through the present, Defendant has repeatedly and unilaterally enrolled the Children in activities, events, or commitments scheduled during Plaintiff’s regular parenting time, including weekends designated for the Children to be with Plaintiff, without meaningful advance consultation or agreement from Plaintiff.

13. Defendant has consistently failed to exercise joint legal decision‑making in good faith as contemplated by G.L. c. 208, § 31 and Massachusetts case law, including but not limited to *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), which recognize that joint legal custody requires an ability and willingness to communicate and cooperate regarding major decisions affecting children.

14. When conflicts arise between the unilateral activities scheduled by Defendant and Plaintiff’s court‑ordered weekends, Defendant has told the Children, in substance, that it is Plaintiff’s “fault” or that Plaintiff is “selfish” if the Children are unable to attend those activities during her parenting time.

15. The Children have reported to Plaintiff that Defendant has told them that Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” when she seeks to maintain, or reasonably adjust, her scheduled time or when she requests to swap weekends to accommodate the Children’s needs and her own obligations.

16. Defendant’s conduct, as reported by the Children, directly violates the spirit and letter of the Existing Order that requires each parent to support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and not disparage the other in front of the Children.

17. As a result of the ongoing conflict, blaming, and disparaging comments, one of the Children has begun experiencing physical symptoms of distress, including recurring stomach aches on transition days between households, which Plaintiff reasonably believes are manifestations of stress and anxiety related to the parental conflict.

18. The pattern of unilateral decision making, scheduling interference, disparagement, and emotional pressure on the Children constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since June 15, 2022, and adversely affects the Children’s emotional well‑being and their relationship with Plaintiff.

19. Massachusetts law requires that custody and parenting-time orders be based on the best interests of the child. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); G.L. c. 208, § 31. A material and substantial change in circumstances affecting a child’s welfare warrants modification of an existing custody order. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. 20 (1981); *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (2004).

20. Under *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), and *Custody of Roche*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 806 (1987), the Court evaluates whether a proposed modification is in the child’s best interests in light of current conditions, even where an existing order has been functioning, if the new circumstances show a detrimental impact on the child’s welfare.

21. Joint legal custody is appropriate only where the parents can communicate and cooperate in advancing the child’s best interests. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184. The persistent unilateral decisions by Defendant, combined with denigrating comments and emotional pressure on the Children, demonstrate a breakdown in the cooperative co‑parenting that joint legal custody requires.

22. Massachusetts courts recognize that a parent’s willingness and ability to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent is a critical factor in determining custody. See *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610, 619–20 (1986); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–27 (1998). Defendant’s conduct in blaming Plaintiff for missed activities and telling the Children that Plaintiff is “selfish” and “doesn’t really love them” undermines the Children’s relationship with Plaintiff and conflicts with these principles.

23. The Children’s emerging physical and emotional symptoms on transition days are indicative of increased stress, which the Court must consider in assessing their best interests. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96 (considering children’s emotional and physical well‑being in custody determinations); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44.

24. The cumulative effect of these changes is substantial and continuing. The Existing Order does not adequately protect the Children from conflict and does not provide sufficiently clear and enforceable rules regarding scheduling, communication, and decision‑making to minimize harm to the Children.

25. For these reasons, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order on June 15, 2022, and the requested modification is necessary to serve the Children’s best interests under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and applicable case law.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

26. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the children. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

27. Plaintiff has been and continues to be the Children’s primary residential parent. The Children have resided primarily with Plaintiff since entry of the Existing Order, are accustomed to her home as their central residence, and are stable in her care.

28. Maintaining a primary residence with Plaintiff, coupled with clear, consistent, and predictable parenting‑time and scheduling rules, will provide the Children with continuity, reduce conflict, and minimize the emotional distress and physical symptoms the Children have begun to exhibit.

29. Clear rules regarding:
    a. advance notice and mutual agreement for scheduling extracurricular activities and events that occur during the other parent’s parenting time;  
    b. non‑disparagement and positive support of the Children’s relationship with the other parent; and  
    c. communication about significant educational, medical, and emotional issues

    are necessary to protect the Children’s best interests under the current circumstances.

30. Plaintiff is willing and able to foster the Children’s relationship with Defendant and to consult in good faith on major decisions, consistent with joint legal custody standards where appropriate, and consistent with the requirement that both parents act to support the Children’s relationship with the other parent. See *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. at 619–20.

31. The requested modification does not seek to eliminate the Children’s relationship with Defendant. Rather, it seeks to place primary physical custody with Plaintiff and to clarify and structure decision‑making and scheduling in a manner that reduces conflict and emotional pressure on the Children, consistent with the best‑interest analysis articulated in *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44, and *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (2004).

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

32. Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the Existing Order to provide that:

   a. **Primary Physical Custody**: Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, shall have primary physical custody of the Children, Liam and Emma Thompson.

   b. **Legal Custody**:  
      i. The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody only to the extent that they are able to communicate and cooperate in making major decisions affecting the Children’s education, medical care, and emotional well‑being; and  
      ii. In the event the Court finds that the parties’ ongoing conflict and communication breakdown render joint legal custody contrary to the Children’s best interests, Plaintiff requests that she be awarded sole legal custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the standards set forth in *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), and *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

   c. **Parenting Time with Defendant**: Defendant, Michael Thompson, shall have reasonable parenting time, including but not limited to alternate weekends and such additional time as the parties may mutually agree, subject to clear provisions to protect the Children from conflict and disparagement.

   d. **Scheduling of Extracurricular and Other Activities**:  
      i. Neither parent shall unilaterally enroll the Children in ongoing extracurricular activities, lessons, practices, or events that are scheduled to occur during the other parent’s court‑ordered parenting time without first providing reasonable advance written notice (e.g., email or text) and obtaining the other parent’s written agreement.  
      ii. If a parent wishes to propose that the Children attend a special event or activity that conflicts with the other parent’s parenting time, the proposing parent shall make a written request and the other parent shall respond in good faith. Any agreed changes shall be confirmed in writing.  
      iii. In the absence of mutual written agreement, the default schedule set forth in the modified order shall control, and no parent shall disparage the other or blame the other in front of the Children for any missed activity that results from adherence to the court‑ordered schedule.

   e. **Non‑Disparagement and Support of Parent‑Child Relationships**:  
      i. Both parents shall refrain from disparaging, denigrating, or making negative comments about the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children.  
      ii. Neither parent shall tell the Children that the other parent does not love them, is “selfish,” or is to “blame” for missed activities or schedule conflicts.  
      iii. Both parents shall affirm the Children’s right to love and enjoy time with the other parent, consistent with Massachusetts public policy favoring the child’s relationship with both parents. See *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

   f. **Communication and Decision‑Making**:  
      i. The parents shall communicate regarding significant medical, educational, and emotional issues concerning the Children, preferably in writing (such as by email or a parenting‑communication application), in a respectful and businesslike manner.  
      ii. Each parent shall provide the other with timely information relating to the Children’s school, medical providers, and extracurricular activities.  
      iii. Each parent shall be entitled to access to the Children’s educational and medical records consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and G.L. c. 208, § 31A.

   g. **Further Orders as Necessary**: The Court may issue such additional, supplemental, and clarifying orders as it deems just and proper in order to implement the above provisions, to reduce conflict, and to protect the Children’s welfare.

### VII. LEGAL AUTHORITY

33. This Complaint for Modification is brought under and supported by the following statutes and cases, among others:

   a. G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of judgments concerning custody and support upon showing of material and substantial change in circumstances);  
   b. G.L. c. 208, § 31 (best interests of the child standard; legal and physical custody);  
   c. G.L. c. 208, § 31A (access to records and information);  
   d. G.L. c. 209B (Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act);  
   e. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (material change in circumstances standard for modification);  
   f. *Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. 20 (1981) (modification upon material change affecting children);  
   g. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (best interests, weighing emotional and physical welfare);  
   h. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests and stability in modification context);  
   i. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (joint legal custody requires ability to communicate and cooperate);  
   j. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (inappropriate to order joint custody where parents cannot communicate);  
   k. *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986) (importance of parent’s willingness to foster child’s relationship with other parent);  
   l. *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (2004) (modification and best interests analysis);  
   m. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best‑interest considerations and joint legal decision‑making);  
   n. *Custody of Roche*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 806 (1987) (modification and current best‑interests assessment).

34. Under these authorities, and in light of the facts alleged above, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order, and modification is necessary and appropriate in order to serve the Children’s best interests.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order dated June 15, 2022;

B. Modify the Existing Order to grant Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor Children, Liam Thompson and Emma Thompson;

F. Enter a clear non‑disparagement order prohibiting either parent from making negative or derogatory remarks about the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children and directing each parent to affirmatively support the Children’s relationship with the other;

G. Order that the parties communicate regarding the Children in a respectful, businesslike manner, primarily in writing, and that each parent promptly share information regarding the Children’s education, medical care, and extracurricular activities;

H. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor Children.
