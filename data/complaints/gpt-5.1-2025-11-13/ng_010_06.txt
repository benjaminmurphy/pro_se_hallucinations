COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  


Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant John Smith (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff regularly walked along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant John Smith is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts 01201, and at all relevant times was the owner, possessor, and/or person in control of the residential property located at that address, including the large maple tree in the front yard abutting the public sidewalk.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for negligence arising from personal injuries suffered by Plaintiff on or about August 15, 2023, in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, thereby placing this matter within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire County because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and the Defendant resides in Berkshire County. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, occupied, and/or exercised control over the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201 (the “Property”).

7. Located in the front yard of the Property, immediately adjacent to and overhanging the public sidewalk, is a large, mature maple tree (the “Tree”).

8. For a significant period of time prior to August 15, 2023—on information and belief, for many months or longer—one of the major branches of the Tree that extended out over the public sidewalk appeared visibly cracked, drooping, and compromised (the “Defective Branch”).

9. Plaintiff, who frequently walks on the residential street where the Property is located, personally observed that the Defective Branch appeared cracked and droopy on multiple occasions prior to August 15, 2023.

10. Neighbors of Defendant likewise observed the condition of the Defective Branch and recognized that it posed a danger to persons using the sidewalk below.

11. On multiple occasions prior to August 15, 2023, neighbors informed Defendant of the dangerous condition of the Defective Branch and suggested that he have the Tree and the Defective Branch inspected by a professional arborist or otherwise repaired, pruned, or removed.

12. In response to such concerns, Defendant stated to at least one neighbor that he would “deal with it in the spring” or words to that effect, thereby acknowledging both awareness of the issue and an intention to address it, but he failed to do so.

13. Despite having actual notice of the cracked, drooping, and hazardous condition of the Defective Branch and its location over a public sidewalk used by pedestrians, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, repair, brace, prune, or remove the Defective Branch or otherwise to make the area safe.

14. Defendant did not retain an arborist, tree service, or other qualified professional to inspect or remediate the Defective Branch prior to August 15, 2023.

15. Defendant failed to warn passersby, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition of the Defective Branch, and did not cordon off, block, or otherwise restrict use of the sidewalk under the Defective Branch.

16. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately midday, Plaintiff was lawfully walking along the public sidewalk in front of the Property, carrying grocery bags, when a fairly ordinary summer thunderstorm passed through Pittsfield.

17. The weather at that time, upon information and belief, involved typical summer rain, wind, and thunder, but there were no tornado warnings or other extreme, extraordinary, or unforeseeable weather events.

18. As Plaintiff was walking on the sidewalk directly in front of 123 Maple Street under the Tree, the Defective Branch suddenly snapped and fell from the Tree.

19. The Defective Branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground and causing immediate pain and trauma.

20. As a direct result of being struck by the Defective Branch, Plaintiff sustained injuries including, but not limited to, a shoulder strain and multiple bruises to her body.

21. Plaintiff sought and obtained medical treatment for these injuries. Her reasonable medical expenses related to the incident are approximately $1,200.

22. Plaintiff was employed in a retail position at the time of the incident and, due to her injuries and medical treatment, she was unable to work for approximately one week.

23. Plaintiff’s lost wages from missed work due to this incident are approximately $600.

24. In addition to her economic losses, Plaintiff experienced pain, suffering, discomfort, emotional distress, and inconvenience as a result of the incident and her injuries.

25. The condition of the Defective Branch prior to its failure was such that a reasonable property owner, in the exercise of ordinary care, would have recognized that it posed an unreasonable risk of harm to persons walking on the sidewalk beneath it.

26. The hazard created by the Defective Branch was not sudden or unknown to Defendant; rather, it was longstanding, visible, and the subject of direct communications from neighbors to Defendant before the incident.

27. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the Defective Branch was likely to fall during reasonably foreseeable weather conditions, including routine summer thunderstorms.

28. Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, and remedy the condition of the Defective Branch, or to warn or protect pedestrians using the adjacent sidewalk, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff and others similarly situated.

29. Plaintiff was using the sidewalk in a normal, lawful, and foreseeable manner at the time of the incident and did nothing to cause or contribute to the Defective Branch’s failure.

30. The falling of the Defective Branch during an ordinary thunderstorm was not an “Act of God” or extraordinary event beyond all human foresight or control, but was a natural and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to properly address the known defective condition of the Tree limb.

31. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other damages.

### IV. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

32. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

33. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of property owes a duty to all lawful visitors to act as a reasonable person under all the circumstances, including with respect to the maintenance of trees and overhanging branches, and to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute reflecting reasonable person standard); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (establishing a general duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (duty to use reasonable care to maintain premises in reasonably safe condition).

34. A landowner’s duty of reasonable care extends to persons lawfully traveling upon adjacent public ways who may be foreseeably injured by dangerous conditions on the land, including defective trees and branches overhanging public sidewalks. See *Sweeney v. Old Colony & Newport R.R. Co.*, 10 Allen 368 (Mass. 1865) (recognizing duty regarding hazards adjacent to public way); *Laflamme v. Dallessio*, 261 Mass. 504 (1928) (duty concerning projections and hazards abutting public way); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 364 (defective conditions on land near highways).

35. Massachusetts cases recognize that when a landowner has actual or constructive notice of a defective or decayed tree or limb that threatens persons using a nearby public way, the landowner has a duty to exercise reasonable care to inspect, maintain, and, where appropriate, remove or remediate the hazard. See *Mahoney v. Perreault*, 275 Mass. 251 (1931) (liability where landowner knew or should have known of decayed tree near public way); *Jones v. Hayden*, 310 Mass. 90 (1941) (duty to exercise reasonable care regarding dangerous trees adjacent to highway).

36. Further, a landowner who has actual knowledge of a specific hazardous condition—such as a visibly cracked, drooping tree limb over a sidewalk—owes a duty to take reasonable measures to correct the condition or to warn foreseeable users of the danger. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371–372 (2010) (general principles of duty to remedy or warn of hazards); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–155 (2013) (same).

**Breach**

37. Defendant had actual and constructive notice of the Defective Branch’s hazardous condition prior to August 15, 2023, by virtue of (a) its obvious, visible cracking and drooping, and (b) multiple warnings and suggestions from neighbors that the Tree or branch should be inspected by an arborist.

38. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to inspect the Tree and Defective Branch, to retain qualified professionals to evaluate its condition, or to prune, brace, or remove the Defective Branch, or otherwise correct the hazard.

39. Defendant further failed to warn pedestrians, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition of the Defective Branch, and failed to block off or otherwise restrict pedestrian access to the portion of the sidewalk directly under the Defective Branch.

40. Defendant’s inaction in the face of known danger constituted a failure to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and a breach of his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff and others using the adjacent public sidewalk. See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. at 743–744 (breach where failure to maintain safe conditions after notice); *Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.*, 92 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 133–134 (2017) (breach through failure to address known hazards).

41. Defendant’s statement that he would “deal with it in the spring” and subsequent failure to do anything demonstrates knowledge of the risk and a deliberate failure to take timely corrective action, further evidencing a breach of his duty of care.

42. No applicable statute, ordinance, or regulation excuses Defendant from his duty to exercise reasonable care with respect to the Tree and the Defective Branch adjacent to a public sidewalk.

**Causation**

43. The foreseeable and natural consequence of leaving a cracked, drooping, and compromised tree limb overhanging a public sidewalk unremedied is that, under ordinary weather conditions—including typical summer thunderstorms—the limb may fail and fall, striking a person using the sidewalk.

44. The ordinary summer thunderstorm on August 15, 2023, was not an extraordinary or unforeseeable event, but rather a normal weather occurrence in Massachusetts that a reasonable property owner must anticipate when assessing the safety of trees and branches. See *Jones v. Hayden*, 310 Mass. at 93 (landowner liable where decay of tree made it susceptible to foreseeable winds); see also *Hill v. Winsor*, 118 Mass. 251, 259 (1875) (distinguishing extraordinary “acts of God” from foreseeable natural forces).

45. Defendant’s failure to address the known hazardous condition of the Defective Branch was a direct and proximate cause of the branch’s falling onto Plaintiff on August 15, 2023.

46. But for Defendant’s negligent failure to inspect, maintain, and remediate the Defective Branch, the branch would not have fallen at that time and place, and Plaintiff would not have been struck and injured.

47. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting losses. See *Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 905 F.2d 515, 524 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law on proximate cause); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 431.

**Damages**

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, requiring medical evaluation and treatment.

49. Plaintiff has incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately $1,200 for treatment of her injuries.

50. Plaintiff lost approximately one week of wages from her retail employment, in the approximate amount of $600, due to her injuries and the need for recovery.

51. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain and discomfort, including pain in her shoulder and back, as well as bruising and residual soreness.

52. Plaintiff has experienced emotional distress, including anxiety, fear, and upset associated with being suddenly struck, knocked to the ground, and injured, and with walking near similar trees and branches.

53. Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life and interference with her normal daily activities during the period of her recovery.

54. Under Massachusetts law, a tortfeasor is liable for all damages proximately caused by his negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering. See *Jones v. Wayland*, 374 Mass. 249, 262 (1978) (elements of tort damages); *G.L. c. 231, § 85* (comparative negligence and damages).

55. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensatory damages from Defendant, including but not limited to: past and future medical expenses, past and future lost earnings and/or loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, together with interest and costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C.

56. To the extent Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s comparative negligence is at issue, Plaintiff expressly denies any such negligence and asserts that any alleged negligence on her part was less than fifty percent of the total negligence, and, in any event, that Defendant’s negligence was the primary and substantial cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. See G.L. c. 231, § 85.

57. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek amendment of this Complaint to specify a precise dollar amount of damages following further investigation and discovery, but reasonably expects her total damages, including pain and suffering, to exceed the jurisdictional minimum of this Court.

---

### V. LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES

58. Plaintiff’s claim is brought under Massachusetts common law of negligence, as informed by and consistent with the following authorities, among others:

   a. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (adopting general duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors);

   c. *Mahoney v. Perreault*, 275 Mass. 251 (1931) (liability for injuries caused by defective tree near public way where landowner knew or should have known of defect);

   d. *Jones v. Hayden*, 310 Mass. 90 (1941) (duty to exercise reasonable care regarding dangerous trees adjacent to highways);

   e. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (general premises liability principles—duty to remedy or warn of hazards);

   f. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) (reasonable care standard for premises liability);

   g. *Hill v. Winsor*, 118 Mass. 251 (1875) (distinguishing ordinary natural forces from extraordinary “acts of God”);

   h. *Jones v. Wayland*, 374 Mass. 249 (1978) (scope of tort damages);

   i. G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute);

   k. G.L. c. 212, § 3 (Superior Court civil jurisdiction).

59. To the extent necessary, Plaintiff relies upon and invokes the Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 283, 364, 431, and related provisions, as persuasive authority often cited by Massachusetts courts in negligence and premises liability cases.
