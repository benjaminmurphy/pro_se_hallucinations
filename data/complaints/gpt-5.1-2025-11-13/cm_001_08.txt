JESSICA THOMPSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL DAVIS,  
    Defendant.  

---------------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
---------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR ORDER

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Emily Davis (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Jacob Davis (date of birth: __________, age 6) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Davis (“Defendant” or “Father”), is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the Children.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 37; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as the prior custody and parenting-time orders were entered by this Court and both parties and the Children presently reside in Massachusetts.

4. On or about April 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order concerning custody and parenting time for the Children (“Original Custody Order”).

5. Under the Original Custody Order, the parties share legal custody as ordered by the Court (or as otherwise specified therein), with the Plaintiff having primary physical custody of the Children, and the Defendant exercising parenting time every other weekend plus one overnight during the week.

6. This Complaint seeks a modification of the parenting-time / physical custody schedule based on a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Original Custody Order, in accordance with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including, without limitation, Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); Custody of Vera, 473 Mass. 325 (2015); and Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).


### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS – MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. At the time the Original Custody Order was entered on April 15, 2021, both parties were employed in regular, daytime positions, generally working roughly standard “9-to-5” schedules, such that the then-agreed-upon and ordered parenting schedule was compatible with both parents’ availability and with the Children’s routines.

8. Subsequent to entry of the Original Custody Order, and within the past several months, the Defendant voluntarily accepted new employment that requires him to work overnight shifts, generally from approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM, on multiple nights per week.

9. The Defendant’s overnight work schedule frequently occurs on nights when he is scheduled, under the current Order, to exercise overnight parenting time with the Children—both on some of his mid-week overnights and on certain weekend overnights.

10. As a result of this new work schedule, the Defendant has repeatedly been either (a) unable to care personally for the Children during his court-ordered overnights, or (b) so exhausted from working overnight that he is not able to provide safe, attentive, and consistent supervision for the Children during his parenting time.

11. On numerous occasions, the Defendant has, with little or no prior notice, returned the Children to the Plaintiff’s residence on evenings or nights when he was scheduled to have overnight parenting time, stating that he is too tired from work to care for them or that he must work overnight.

12. On other occasions, instead of returning the Children to the Plaintiff, the Defendant has left the Children in the care of his adult roommate—a person the Plaintiff barely knows and did not agree to as a regular caregiver—during times when the Defendant is either working or sleeping.

13. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that, during some of their overnights or scheduled time with the Defendant when he has worked overnight or is extremely fatigued, they often fall asleep on the couch while the Defendant naps or sleeps after his shift, with limited direct supervision, structure, or attention.

14. The Defendant’s new overnight work schedule, and his resulting fatigue and periods of unavailability during his court-ordered parenting time, were not contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the April 15, 2021 Order.

15. The change in the Defendant’s employment and work hours constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the practical ability of the Defendant to safely and appropriately exercise his currently ordered parenting time, and therefore directly affects the Children’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

16. The repeated last-minute changes, cancellations, and transfers of the Children due to the Defendant’s exhaustion and unavailability have created instability and confusion in the Children’s routine, which is contrary to their emotional and developmental needs and their best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–45 (importance of stability and continuity in custody arrangements).

17. The Defendant’s pattern of leaving the Children with a third party (his roommate) during his court-ordered parenting time, without the Plaintiff’s consent and without consistent proof that this arrangement is safe, suitable, and reliable, further demonstrates that the current schedule no longer serves the Children’s best interests. See Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619, 626–27 (2000) (best interests standard focuses on whether arrangement serves child’s welfare, stability, and safety).

18. The Plaintiff remains willing and able to provide stable day-to-day care for the Children, including on nights when the Defendant is unavailable or too fatigued due to his overnight work schedule.

19. The Plaintiff is not seeking to terminate the Defendant’s relationship with the Children, nor to prevent reasonable parenting time; rather, she seeks a modification of the overnight schedule so that overnights occur only when the Defendant is actually off work, rested, and able to provide safe, consistent, and direct care.

20. Since the Defendant’s work schedule changed, the practical reality is that the Plaintiff has had the Children significantly more than contemplated under the Original Custody Order, as she regularly steps in on short notice when the Defendant is unavailable or too tired to exercise his parenting time.

21. The above circumstances constitute a material and substantial change since the April 15, 2021 Order, warranting modification of the parenting plan. See, e.g., Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (substantial change in circumstances standard); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (modification appropriate when circumstances change and child’s best interests require adjustment).

22. A revised parenting schedule that limits the Defendant’s overnights to those nights when he is not working, and is reasonably rested and available, will provide the Children with a more predictable, safe, and stable routine, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 (best interests of the child as paramount in custody determinations) and G.L. c. 208, § 28.

23. Failure to modify the Order exposes the Children to ongoing instability, inconsistent supervision, and avoidable risk related to the Defendant’s exhaustion and absence during overnights, which is contrary to their best interests and welfare.

24. It is in the best interests of the Children, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and relevant case law, including Custody of Kali, Custody of Vaughn, Williams v. Massa, and Custody of Zia, 455 Mass. 327 (2009), that the Court modify the current parenting-time arrangements to conform to the Defendant’s actual availability and to safeguard the Children’s need for stability, safety, and appropriate supervision.


### III. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

25. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and, where applicable, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, the Court may “modify or change its judgment at any time” regarding custody and parenting time if it finds that a “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.”

26. Massachusetts courts apply a two-part test for modification of custody or parenting-time orders: (1) whether there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior order; and (2) whether modification is in the best interests of the child. See Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); Custody of Vera, 473 Mass. 325 (2015).

27. A significant change in a parent’s work schedule and corresponding availability for parenting time can constitute a material change warranting modification, particularly when it affects the child’s stability, safety, and routine. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (recognizing changes in the practical circumstances of care as relevant to modification); Haas v. Puchalski, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980).

28. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Zia, 455 Mass. 327 (2009); Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).

29. The need for stability, continuity of care, and a predictable routine is central to the best-interests analysis, particularly for young children. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–45; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

30. Where, as here, the custodial arrangement no longer aligns with the realities of the parents’ circumstances and tends to create instability and risk, the Court has the authority and responsibility to adjust the parenting schedule so that it serves the Children’s best interests. See Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 183–84; Custody of Vera, 473 Mass. at 332–33.

31. In light of the Defendant’s substantial change in work schedule (7 PM–7 AM shifts, several nights per week), and its impact on his ability to safely and consistently exercise overnight parenting time, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances as contemplated by G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the above authorities.

32. Modification of the existing parenting-time order is necessary to protect the Children’s best interests by ensuring that overnights and other extended periods are scheduled only when the Defendant is actually available, awake, and able to provide direct care.


### IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

33. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the April 15, 2021 Order concerning custody and parenting time as follows (or in substantially similar form as the Court deems just and proper):

   a. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, shall continue to have primary physical custody of the Children, with legal custody to remain as previously ordered unless specifically modified by the Court.

   b. The Defendant, Michael Davis, shall continue to have reasonable parenting time, but his overnight parenting time shall be limited to nights when he is not scheduled to work and, on the following morning, is not required to leave for work before a time that would unreasonably disrupt the Children’s sleep, school attendance, or regular routine.

   c. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with his written or electronic work schedule (including any updates) at least fourteen (14) days in advance, or as soon as reasonably practicable if the schedule is provided to him on shorter notice, so that the parties can plan parenting time consistent with the Defendant’s actual availability.

   d. The midweek overnight currently ordered shall be converted to non-overnight parenting time (for example, an afternoon / evening visit ending no later than a reasonable bedtime for the Children) on weeks when the Defendant is working overnight or is otherwise unable safely to supervise the Children overnight.

   e. On the Defendant’s alternating weekends, overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when the Defendant is not scheduled to work an overnight shift and is reasonably rested and available to personally supervise and care for the Children. If the Defendant is scheduled to work overnight on one or both weekend nights, those overnights shall either:  
      i. be rescheduled to another mutually agreed-upon night when the Defendant is off work; or  
      ii. be foregone for that particular week, without any presumption of “make-up” overnights unless the parties mutually agree.

   f. The Defendant shall not routinely delegate overnight responsibility for the Children to his roommate or any other unrelated third party in lieu of his own care during his scheduled parenting time, except for brief, reasonable periods typical of any parent’s childcare needs (e.g., short errands, appointments), unless the Plaintiff expressly agrees in advance or the Court orders otherwise.

   g. The parties shall communicate in good faith via mutually agreed methods (e.g., text or email) regarding any necessary, short-notice changes to parenting time arising from the Defendant’s work obligations, with the understanding that the Plaintiff will have the Children when the Defendant is working or too fatigued to provide safe care.

   h. Any and all other provisions of the April 15, 2021 Order not inconsistent with this modification shall remain in full force and effect.

34. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court enter any additional or alternative orders necessary to clarify the parenting schedule and to ensure that the Children’s overnights and extended visits occur only when the Defendant is reasonably available, awake, and capable of providing safe, attentive care.

35. The Plaintiff also requests such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the Children’s best interests.


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the April 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time Order, based on the Defendant’s substantial change in work schedule and availability;

B. Find and rule that modification of the existing parenting-time / custody provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the Children, Emily and Jacob;

C. Modify the April 15, 2021 Order so that:

   1. The Plaintiff continues as the primary physical custodian of the Children (and legal custody remains as previously ordered unless expressly modified);  
   2. The Defendant’s overnight parenting time is limited to those nights when he is not working overnight, is reasonably rested, and is actually available to provide direct care;  
   3. The Defendant provides advance notice of his work schedule to the Plaintiff and cooperates in scheduling parenting time consistent with his availability;  
   4. The existing midweek overnight is converted to non-overnight parenting time when the Defendant is working overnight or otherwise unavailable; and  
   5. The Defendant does not routinely delegate his overnight parenting time to a roommate or other unrelated third party in lieu of his own care, except as reasonably necessary for short periods or as otherwise agreed or ordered;

D. Order such further and other relief as the Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the Children, including any clarifying provisions necessary to implement the modified schedule.
