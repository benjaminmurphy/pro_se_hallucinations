COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY, BICYCLE DOORING COLLISION)  

Plaintiff Alex Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Alex Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff was employed in the City of Boston and regularly commuted by bicycle.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”) is an individual residing in Massachusetts who, at all times relevant, operated, controlled, and/or had possession of a motor vehicle used in connection with a rideshare service in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

4. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because the collision and resulting injuries occurred in Massachusetts, Defendant was operating a vehicle on a Massachusetts public way, and Defendant resides and/or regularly transacts business in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and G.L. c. 223, § 8, because the incident giving rise to this action occurred at or near 500 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, which is located in Suffolk County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately 8:00 a.m. (or such other time as may be shown by the evidence), Plaintiff was riding a bicycle to work in Boston, Massachusetts.

7. Plaintiff was lawfully riding in a marked bicycle lane on a busy street adjacent to or in front of 500 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116.

8. Plaintiff was operating the bicycle carefully and prudently, in accordance with Massachusetts law and applicable traffic regulations, and in the same direction as traffic.

9. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet, obeying traffic signals, and remaining within the marked bicycle lane.

10. At or near the same time and location, Defendant was operating or in control of a motor vehicle used in connection with a rideshare service and had parked or stopped the vehicle in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bicycle lane.

11. The vehicle controlled by Defendant was parked directly next to the bike lane such that the driver’s side door, when opened, would extend into or across the bicycle lane.

12. Without first making a proper observation of oncoming bicycle traffic and without checking his mirror or otherwise ensuring that opening his door would be safe, Defendant suddenly and forcefully opened the driver’s side door of his vehicle into the marked bicycle lane.

13. Defendant opened the door at or just before the moment Plaintiff was passing alongside the vehicle in the bicycle lane, leaving Plaintiff no reasonable time or distance to stop, slow, or safely swerve to avoid impact.

14. As a direct result, Plaintiff collided with the edge of the suddenly opened driver’s door, was thrown from the bicycle, and was propelled onto the pavement.

15. Plaintiff sustained immediate and painful bodily injuries, including but not limited to road rash and abrasions to his arms and legs, as well as trauma to his mouth and teeth.

16. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and damaged beyond reasonable repair, rendering the bicycle unsafe and unusable.

17. At the scene, Defendant admitted fault, stating in substance and/or verbatim that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at or checking his phone.

18. Defendant’s admission that he was checking his phone at or about the time he opened the door demonstrates that he failed to keep a proper lookout and failed to exercise reasonable care for the safety of Plaintiff and other road users.

19. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a bicyclist lawfully traveling on a public way, to exercise reasonable care when exiting his vehicle, including but not limited to checking mirrors and blind spots and refraining from opening his door into moving traffic, including bicycle traffic.

20. Defendant further owed a duty pursuant to Massachusetts statutes and regulations governing the opening of vehicle doors, the operation of motor vehicles, and the interaction of motor vehicles with bicycles on public ways.

21. Despite these duties, Defendant negligently opened his car door into the marked bicycle lane without checking for oncoming cyclists, causing a foreseeable and preventable collision.

22. After the collision, Plaintiff sought medical evaluation and treatment for his injuries, including treatment of abrasions and follow-up care.

23. Plaintiff also required dental treatment and restorative work as a result of a chipped front tooth sustained during the fall.

24. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses in an amount of approximately $1,200.00 and anticipates additional medical and dental expenses may be incurred in the future.

25. Plaintiff’s bicycle was rendered unusable due to a bent and damaged frame, requiring Plaintiff to purchase a replacement bicycle at his own expense.

26. Plaintiff’s inability to commute to work by bicycle, combined with his injuries and recovery period, caused him to miss work and lose approximately $800.00 in wages.

27. Plaintiff experienced physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a direct and proximate result of the collision.

28. Following the incident, Plaintiff submitted a claim to Defendant’s automobile liability insurance carrier seeking compensation for his damages.

29. Defendant’s insurer subsequently informed Plaintiff that Defendant had stated Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

30. That statement is false. At all relevant times, Plaintiff remained within the marked bicycle lane, operated his bicycle in a straight and predictable manner, and did not weave in and out of traffic.

31. Defendant’s later statement to his insurance carrier contradicts his initial admission at the scene and appears calculated to shift blame to Plaintiff and to avoid responsibility for Defendant’s own negligent conduct.

32. Plaintiff did nothing to cause or contribute to the collision. Plaintiff was operating his bicycle reasonably and prudently, and the collision occurred solely because Defendant suddenly opened his door into the bicycle lane without proper lookout and while distracted by his phone.

33. Plaintiff has complied with all applicable statutory conditions precedent, if any, to the bringing of this action.

34. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, property damage, lost wages, medical and dental expenses, and other economic and non-economic damages.

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW

35. Massachusetts law recognizes that motorists and persons exiting vehicles owe a duty of reasonable care to others lawfully using the public way, including bicyclists. See, e.g., **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (general duty of reasonable care); **Beck v. Lenzi**, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 (1984) (motorist’s duty of reasonable care to persons using the way).

36. Under **G.L. c. 90, § 14**, “[n]o person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists,” and no person shall leave a door open on the side of a vehicle available to moving traffic “for a period of time longer than necessary to load or unload passengers.” This statutory duty extends specifically to the protection of bicyclists.

37. Violation of a statute intended to protect public safety, while not negligence per se in Massachusetts, is evidence of negligence. See **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990); **Orcutt v. Miller**, 201 Mass. 432, 437 (1909).

38. Massachusetts law further requires that operators of motor vehicles exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others using the road. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. at 707–09; **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401, 404 (1991) (defining negligence as failure to exercise reasonable care).

39. Bicyclists are recognized as lawful users of public ways and are entitled to the protections afforded by Massachusetts traffic and motor vehicle laws. See **G.L. c. 85, § 11B** (bicycles on public ways; rights and duties); **Commonwealth v. Callahan**, 405 Mass. 200, 202 (1989) (bicyclist as lawful roadway user).

40. Under Massachusetts common law, duty, breach, causation, and damages are the required elements of a negligence claim. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

41. Foreseeability of harm is central to the existence and scope of the duty of care. See **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996); **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.**, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).

42. Massachusetts applies a comparative negligence framework under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, whereby a plaintiff’s contributory negligence does not bar recovery unless it is greater than the total negligence of the defendants; damages are diminished in proportion to the plaintiff’s comparative fault, if any.

43. A plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and fair compensation for pain, suffering, and impairment causally related to the defendant’s negligence. See **Grassi v. Femi**, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1997); **Poirier v. Plymouth**, 374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978).

44. The question of negligence and comparative fault, where disputed, is generally one for the jury. See **Goulet v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc.**, 399 Mass. 547, 553 (1987); **Uloth v. City Tank Corp.**, 376 Mass. 874, 881 (1978).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST DEFENDANT MICHAEL THOMPSON ONLY)

45. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 44 as though fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

46. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the use and control of his motor vehicle, including in opening the driver’s side door, to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to bicyclists lawfully using the adjacent bicycle lane and public way.

47. Defendant specifically owed Plaintiff a statutory duty under G.L. c. 90, § 14 not to open his vehicle’s door unless and until it was reasonably safe to do so without interfering with or endangering other traffic, including bicyclists.

48. Defendant also owed a duty to refrain from engaging in distracting activities, such as looking at or handling a phone, at the time he opened his vehicle door into an active bicycle lane.

**Breach**

49. Defendant breached his duties of care by, among other acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to check his side and rear-view mirrors for oncoming bicyclists before opening his door;

   b. Failing to look over his shoulder or otherwise visually confirm that the bicycle lane was clear;

   c. Opening the driver’s side door directly into a marked bicycle lane at a time when Plaintiff was approaching in that lane;

   d. Opening the door suddenly, without adequate warning or time for Plaintiff to react;

   e. Failing to pay adequate attention to surrounding traffic conditions, including bicycle traffic;

   f. Using or checking his phone instead of maintaining proper lookout before and/or while opening his door;

   g. Parking or stopping the vehicle in a position adjacent to, and intruding into, the area used by bicyclists without exercising heightened caution when exiting;

   h. Failing to operate and exit his vehicle as a reasonably prudent person would under the same or similar circumstances; and

   i. Violating G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related traffic safety principles designed to protect bicyclists and other road users from “dooring” incidents.

50. Defendant’s conduct, viewed in its entirety, fell below the standard of care owed to a reasonable and prudent person exiting a vehicle on a busy Boston street adjacent to a marked bicycle lane.

**Causation**

51. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of the collision between Plaintiff and Defendant’s opened vehicle door.

52. But for Defendant’s negligent opening of the door into the bicycle lane and his failure to keep a proper lookout, Plaintiff would not have collided with the door, would not have been thrown from his bicycle, and would not have suffered the injuries and damages described herein.

53. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—including bodily injuries caused by impact with a suddenly opened vehicle door and resulting fall—is a natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to ensure it was safe before opening the door into the path of a bicyclist.

**Damages**

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer the following injuries and damages:

   a. **Bodily injuries**, including but not limited to road rash and abrasions to the arms and legs, with associated pain, discomfort, and risk of scarring;

   b. **Dental injuries**, including a chipped front tooth requiring restorative dental care;

   c. **Medical and dental expenses** of approximately $1,200.00 to date, with the possibility of additional treatment and expenses in the future;

   d. **Property damage** to Plaintiff’s bicycle, including a bent and damaged frame that rendered the bicycle unsafe and unusable, requiring replacement;

   e. **Lost wages** of approximately $800.00 due to time missed from work as a result of the injuries and recovery;

   f. **Pain and suffering**, both physical and emotional, including but not limited to pain from the impact and abrasions, discomfort during recovery, anxiety and distress related to bicycling in traffic following the incident, and disruption of Plaintiff’s normal activities;

   g. **Inconvenience and loss of enjoyment of life**, including limitation of recreational and commuter bicycling and other activities that Plaintiff previously engaged in without restriction; and

   h. Any other damages that may be proven at trial.

55. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were not caused or contributed to by any negligence on Plaintiff’s part. Plaintiff was operating his bicycle lawfully, within the marked bicycle lane, and with reasonable care under the circumstances.

56. To the extent Defendant alleges comparative negligence, Plaintiff denies any negligent conduct and asserts that any such allegation is without merit. In any event, Plaintiff’s alleged negligence, if any, was less than Defendant’s negligence and should not bar recovery under G.L. c. 231, § 85.

57. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant fair and reasonable compensation for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical and dental expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Alex Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Michael Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed the jurisdictional minimum of this Court, including:
