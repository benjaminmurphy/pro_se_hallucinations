---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about July 15, 2023, at approximately afternoon hours, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a paved or maintained path within Oak Hill Park, located at or about 123 Oak Street, Newton, Massachusetts (the “Park”).

7. Oak Hill Park is a public park owned, operated, or controlled by the City of Newton and open to members of the public, including Plaintiff, for recreational activities such as jogging.

8. At all relevant times, there were posted signs in the Park stating that all dogs must be on leashes, or words to that effect (“Leash Signs”).

9. Upon information and belief, the City of Newton requires that dogs in public parks, including Oak Hill Park, be leashed, either by ordinance, regulation, or park rule (the “Leash Rules”).

10. On July 15, 2023, Defendant was present in the Park with his dog, a large dog of substantial size and weight (the “Dog”).

11. Upon information and belief, Defendant was a frequent user of the Park who regularly allowed the Dog to run off-leash in the Park despite the Leash Signs and Leash Rules.

12. On the date of the incident, Defendant had a dog leash in his possession and was holding the leash draped over his shoulder, but the leash was not attached to the Dog.

13. At the time of the incident, Defendant was located approximately thirty (30) feet away from the Dog, engaged in conversation with friends, and was not paying adequate attention to the Dog or to other park users, including Plaintiff.

14. As Plaintiff was jogging on the path in the Park, the Dog suddenly and without warning charged directly toward Plaintiff, running at speed and barking loudly and aggressively.

15. The Dog’s sudden charge and loud barking caused Plaintiff to reasonably fear that the Dog was going to attack or bite her.

16. The Dog’s conduct was sudden, unexpected, and startling, and it created an imminent and apparent risk of bodily harm to Plaintiff.

17. The Dog was off-leash, uncontrolled, and not physically restrained by Defendant at the time it charged toward Plaintiff.

18. Defendant was not in a position to physically restrain the Dog quickly because he was at least thirty (30) feet away from the Dog and had not kept the Dog on a leash, despite the clear Leash Signs and Leash Rules.

19. In response to the Dog’s charge and barking, and in a reasonable and instinctive attempt to avoid being bitten or attacked, Plaintiff swerved suddenly off the paved path to her side, away from the Dog’s path of travel.

20. As Plaintiff swerved, she encountered a tree root or similar raised natural obstruction at the edge of the path and tripped.

21. Plaintiff then fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path, landing forcefully on her arm and wrist.

22. As a direct result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist.

23. The Dog did not physically contact Plaintiff, but its sudden and aggressive charge, while off-leash and uncontrolled, was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s evasive maneuver, fall, and resulting injuries.

24. After Plaintiff fell, the Dog stopped and/or was eventually recalled by Defendant, who then called the Dog back.

25. Several other joggers and park users observed the incident, including the Dog’s off-leash condition, its charge and barking toward Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s attempt to avoid the Dog, and Plaintiff’s resulting fall and injury.

26. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in her wrist and other soreness from the fall.

27. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment, including an evaluation in a hospital emergency room, diagnostic imaging (such as X‑rays), and follow‑up care for her fractured wrist.

28. Plaintiff was required to wear a wrist brace for several weeks and was limited in her daily activities, including work and recreational pursuits.

29. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical bills and related expenses for treatment of her injuries.

30. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability to work for a period of time as a direct result of the injuries sustained in the incident.

31. Additionally, Plaintiff was unable to participate in a scheduled piano recital for which she had been practicing, causing her significant emotional distress, disappointment, and loss of enjoyment of life.

32. Plaintiff experienced pain and suffering, physical limitations, discomfort, interference with sleep and normal activities of daily living, and emotional distress as a result of the incident.

33. Plaintiff’s injuries, expenses, and losses were reasonably foreseeable consequences of allowing a large dog to run off‑leash in a public park, contrary to clear posted rules, and failing to control the dog so as not to frighten or endanger joggers and other park users.

34. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was acting with due care, was lawfully present in the Park, and was using the path in a normal and foreseeable manner.

35. At all relevant times, Defendant knew or reasonably should have known:  
    a. that the Park required dogs to be on leashes;  
    b. that his Dog, which was large and capable of causing injury, could frighten or harm others if allowed to run loose; and  
    c. that allowing the Dog to run off‑leash, while Defendant stood some distance away and distracted, created an unreasonable risk of harm to joggers and other park users, including Plaintiff.

36. Defendant’s conduct in allowing the Dog to run loose off‑leash in violation of the Leash Signs and Leash Rules, and in failing to control the Dog so as to avoid frightening or endangering others, was careless, unreasonable, and in breach of his legal duty of care under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence (Common‑Law Negligence)**

37. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

38. Under Massachusetts law, a person who owns, keeps, or controls a dog owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the animal and to prevent it from causing foreseeable harm to others lawfully on or near the premises. See, e.g., *Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 283 Mass. 158, 162 (1933) (general duty of reasonable care); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 518 (liability for harm done by domestic animals kept without reasonable care), cited with approval in cases such as *Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co.*, 407 Mass. 185, 189–90 (1990).

39. Defendant, as owner or keeper of the Dog, owed Plaintiff a duty to keep the Dog under reasonable control and to comply with applicable leash requirements in the Park so as to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to park users, including joggers like Plaintiff.

40. Defendant further owed Plaintiff the duty imposed by Massachusetts common law to act as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (“To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, that the defendant breached this duty, that damage resulted, and that there was a causal relation between the breach of the duty and the damage.”); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (reasonable care in light of foreseeable risks).

41. The presence of posted Leash Signs and applicable local ordinances or rules requiring dogs to be on leashes in the Park reinforced and gave specific content to Defendant’s duty of care to keep the Dog leashed and under control.

42. Under Massachusetts law, violation of a safety statute, ordinance, or regulation is evidence of negligence as to the harm the statute was designed to prevent. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990); *MacDonald v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.*, 394 Mass. 131, 139 (1985); *Anzalone v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 403 Mass. 119, 124 (1988).

**Breach**

43. Defendant breached his duty of care owed to Plaintiff in that he, among other things:

   a. Allowed a large dog to run loose and off‑leash in the Park, despite clear Leash Signs and applicable Leash Rules requiring dogs to be on leashes;

   b. Failed to attach the leash he possessed to the Dog, instead draping it over his shoulder while the Dog ran free;

   c. Failed to maintain adequate physical control or supervision over the Dog, remaining approximately thirty (30) feet away while engaged in conversation with friends;

   d. Allowed or failed to prevent the Dog from suddenly charging and barking aggressively toward Plaintiff as she jogged on the path; and

   e. Failed to take timely, reasonable steps to prevent the Dog’s charge or to protect Plaintiff and other park users from foreseeable fright, evasive actions, and resulting harm.

44. A reasonably prudent dog owner in Defendant’s position, aware of the Leash Signs, the public nature of the Park, and the foreseeable presence of joggers and other park users, would have kept the Dog on a leash and under close control to prevent it from charging at or frightening passersby.

45. Defendant’s failure to leash or control the Dog under these circumstances constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts law. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. at 697–98 (reaffirming negligence framework); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 153–54 (discussing foreseeability and duty where a defendant fails to exercise reasonable care in controlling a dangerous instrumentality).

46. To the extent Defendant violated any applicable Newton leash ordinances or park regulations, such violations constitute evidence of negligence and of breach of his duty of care to persons, such as Plaintiff, whom such rules are intended to protect. See *Bennett*, 408 Mass. at 359–60.

**Causation**

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, including his failure to leash and control the Dog, the Dog charged at Plaintiff, barking loudly and aggressively, causing Plaintiff to reasonably fear immediate bodily harm.

48. Plaintiff’s reaction—swerving off the path to avoid the perceived danger from the charging Dog—was a reasonable and foreseeable response to Defendant’s negligent conduct.

49. Under Massachusetts law, a negligent actor is liable for harms that are the natural and probable consequence of the negligence, including injuries resulting from a plaintiff’s reasonable efforts to avoid perceived danger created by the defendant. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (causation and foreseeability); *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978) (foreseeability of harm and natural consequences).

50. It was reasonably foreseeable that allowing a large dog to run off‑leash in a public park and to charge and bark at a jogger would cause that person to attempt to evade the dog and that such evasive action could lead to a fall and physical injury.

51. But for Defendant’s negligence in allowing the Dog to run loose and charge at Plaintiff, Plaintiff would not have been compelled to swerve off the path, trip over the tree root, fall down the embankment, or suffer a fractured wrist and related injuries.

52. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor to, and a legal cause of, Plaintiff’s injuries and losses. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. at 696 (causal relation required); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 431 (legal cause where defendant’s negligence is substantial factor in bringing about harm), cited with approval in *Solimene*, 399 Mass. at 794–95.

**Damages**

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist and related physical injuries.

54. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses, including emergency room treatment, diagnostic imaging, brace or immobilization, and follow‑up care.

55. Plaintiff lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability to work for a period of time as a result of her injuries.

56. Plaintiff experienced and continues to experience physical pain and suffering, including pain in her wrist and arm, discomfort, and limitations on normal activities of daily living.

57. Plaintiff suffered emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish resulting from the sudden frightening incident with the Dog, the injury, and the resulting limitations and disruptions to her life, including her inability to participate in the piano recital for which she had been practicing.

58. Plaintiff suffered loss of enjoyment of life and interference with recreational, social, and personal activities due to her injuries.

59. Plaintiff may incur additional medical expenses in the future and may continue to experience pain, discomfort, and limitations as a result of the injuries sustained.

60. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for all harms proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. See, e.g., *Shantigar Found. v. Bear Mountain Builders, Inc.*, 441 Mass. 131, 142–43 (2004) (discussing damages in negligence); *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 549–50 (1982) (recognizing recovery for emotional and mental harm associated with physical injury).

61. Plaintiff also seeks prejudgment interest on her damages at the statutory rate from the date of commencement of this action, as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

62. Plaintiff’s damages exceed the jurisdictional minimum of this Court and are within its jurisdictional limit as set forth in G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A.

**Comparative Negligence**

63. Plaintiff denies any negligence on her own part. However, to the extent any negligence is attributed to Plaintiff, her damages should be reduced only in accordance with Massachusetts comparative negligence law. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Colter v. Barber-Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 61–62 (1988).

64. Plaintiff’s reaction in swerving off the path was a reasonable and instinctive response to an apparent and imminent threat created by Defendant’s negligence, and any such responsive conduct does not bar or substantially diminish Plaintiff’s right to recovery.
