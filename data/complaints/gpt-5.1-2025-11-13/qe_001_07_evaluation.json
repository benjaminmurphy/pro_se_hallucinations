While the facts involve noise from a bar rather than classic habitability defects (like heat or structural issues), the court explicitly ties this to prior cases involving defective conditions (e.g., heat, boiler, services) and frames the rule in terms of nonfeasance/knowing failure to act on conditions making the premises not reasonably habitable. Thus, by analogy and reasoning, it supports the proposition, though not in those precise words.",
