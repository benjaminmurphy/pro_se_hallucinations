COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(PARENTING/CUSTODY)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully files this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters, and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emma Thompson (date of birth: __________, age 10) and Noah Thompson (date of birth: __________, age 8) (collectively, the “Children”).

2. The Defendant, Kyle Miller (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in __________________, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6; and applicable provisions of G.L. c. 209C, because the original custody/parenting order was entered by this Court, the parties and Children reside in Massachusetts, and the Court retains continuing jurisdiction over issues of custody and parenting time.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT/ORDER

4. On or about May 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment/Order (the “2022 Order”) concerning custody and parenting time of the Children.

5. The 2022 Order provides, among other things, that:

   a. The parties shall have joint legal custody of the Children;  
   b. The Children shall primarily reside with Mother; and  
   c. Father shall have parenting time with the Children on a regular schedule, specifically every other weekend; and  
   d. Each parent shall support and foster the Children’s relationship with the other parent and shall not disparage the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children.

6. At the time the 2022 Order was entered, the Court determined that the provisions of that Order were in the best interests of the Children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and related case law.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since entry of the 2022 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children’s welfare and the effectiveness of the current custody and parenting arrangement.

8. Over approximately the past year, Father has repeatedly enrolled the Children in extracurricular and other activities that occur during Mother’s scheduled parenting time and/or specifically during Mother’s weekends, without prior notice to or consultation with Mother and without her agreement.

9. Father has then told the Children that if they do not attend such activities while they are with Mother, it is because Mother is “selfish” or does not “really love them,” or words to that effect, thereby placing blame on Mother in a manner contrary to the 2022 Order and contrary to the Children’s best interests.

10. The Children have reported to Mother that Father has made such statements about Mother’s motives and love for them, and has characterized Mother as the reason they may miss scheduled activities when they are with her.

11. When Mother has reasonably requested that the parties swap weekends or adjust the parenting schedule to accommodate both the Children’s activities and existing parenting time, Father has, on multiple occasions, refused to cooperate, and has continued to make negative and disparaging statements about Mother to the Children regarding scheduling conflicts.

12. As a result of this persistent conflict, disparagement, and scheduling manipulation, one of the Children has begun experiencing stomach aches and increased anxiety on transition days between households, which Mother reasonably believes are related to stress regarding transitions, scheduling conflicts, and inter-parental conflict.

13. Father’s repeated actions:

   a. Undermine Mother’s relationship with the Children;  
   b. Create loyalty conflicts for the Children;  
   c. Place the Children in the middle of adult disputes;  
   d. Cause emotional distress and physical symptoms (including stomach aches) in at least one Child; and  
   e. Directly contravene the 2022 Order’s requirement that the parties support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the Children.

14. These developments have substantially altered the circumstances that existed at the time of the 2022 Order and show that the current joint legal custody and parenting provisions, as written and as presently functioning, are no longer adequately serving the Children’s best interests.

15. The pattern of unilateral decision‑making by Father regarding the Children’s activities during Mother’s parenting time demonstrates an ongoing breakdown in the parties’ ability to jointly exercise legal custody in a cooperative manner, particularly on important issues affecting the Children’s schedules, stability, and emotional well‑being.

16. The Children’s increasing distress around transitions, combined with Father’s disparaging remarks and scheduling practices, constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the custody and parenting-time provisions of the 2022 Order, consistent with the standards set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 28 and interpreted by the appellate courts.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITY

17. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may revise and alter a judgment concerning the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

18. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have held that a custody or parenting order may be modified where there has been (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (2) a showing that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:

   a. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (modification requires material change in circumstances and best interests of the child);  
   b. *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (articulating standard for modification of custody and parenting orders);  
   c. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests of the child is paramount consideration);  
   d. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (describing best‑interest factors and deference to trial court’s determinations);  
   e. *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2016) (material change justifying custody modification where circumstances affecting child’s welfare have substantially changed);  
   f. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (importance of stable and nurturing environment and of parents’ ability to cooperate);  
   g. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (court considers impact of conflict on child and parental ability to foster relationship with other parent);  
   h. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (parent’s disparagement and interference with relationship with other parent may warrant modification);  
   i. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (material change and best interests analysis for post‑judgment modifications);  
   j. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (emphasizing that the child’s welfare and emotional well‑being are central to custody decisions).

19. Massachusetts statutes direct the Court to consider the best interests of the child as the overriding concern in custody matters. See G.L. c. 208, § 31 (defining legal and physical custody and requiring determination based on best interests of the child); see also G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10 & 20 (in paternity/parentage actions, custody and visitation orders may be modified in accordance with the best interests of the child, upon changed circumstances).

20. In assessing best interests, the Court may consider, among other factors, the emotional ties between the children and each parent, the parents’ ability to cooperate and communicate regarding major decisions affecting the children, and each parent’s willingness and ability to foster the children’s relationship with the other parent. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–97; G.L. c. 208, § 31.

21. The Appeals Court has recognized that persistent, negative, and disparaging comments by one parent about the other, made in the presence of a child, can be contrary to the child’s best interests and may support modification of custody or parenting arrangements. See *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 871–72; see also *Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 191–92.

22. Where the evidence shows that the parties’ inability to cooperate in exercising joint legal custody is causing stress for the children and undermining their welfare, the Court may modify the custody arrangement, including by allocating primary decision‑making authority to one parent or adjusting the parenting schedule to reduce conflict. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–87; *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 152–54.

23. The facts described in paragraphs 7 through 16 above constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2022 Order, and the requested modification is necessary and appropriate for the Children’s best interests, pursuant to the authority cited in paragraphs 17 through 22.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

24. The Children have long primarily resided with Mother, and the 2022 Order already recognizes Mother as the primary residential parent.

25. Mother has consistently encouraged the Children’s relationship with Father and has endeavored to follow the 2022 Order’s requirements regarding fostering the parent‑child relationship and avoiding disparagement.

26. The pattern of unilateral scheduling by Father during Mother’s parenting time, coupled with disparaging comments toward Mother and blaming her for missed activities, is harming the Children’s emotional well‑being, undermining their sense of security, and causing at least one Child to experience physical symptoms (stomach aches) associated with transitions.

27. A clearer allocation of decision‑making authority regarding the Children’s schedules and activities, particularly as they relate to each parent’s parenting time, and a more defined parenting plan, will reduce conflict, provide predictability, and protect the Children from being placed in loyalty conflicts.

28. It is in the best interests of the Children that:

   a. Mother be confirmed as the primary physical custodian with a clearly articulated parenting schedule that minimizes conflict and provides stability;  
   b. Father’s parenting time be adjusted, as necessary, to ensure that the Children are not routinely scheduled for new activities during Mother’s designated weekends without her prior agreement, and that any activities scheduled during the other parent’s time are arranged only with the other parent’s advance knowledge and consent;  
   c. The parties’ rights and responsibilities regarding legal custody and major decision‑making — particularly as to scheduling and extracurricular activities — be clarified in a way that limits unilateral decisions and requires consultation and, where necessary, Court‑ordered default rules; and  
   d. The non‑disparagement and co‑parenting provisions be strengthened and specifically enforced to protect the Children from exposure to inter‑parental conflict and negative commentary about either parent.

29. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to protect the Children’s best interests, reduce conflict, and promote their emotional and physical well‑being.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. FIND that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2022 Order, as described herein.

2. FIND that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions is in the best interests of the minor Children, Emma Thompson and Noah Thompson.

3. MODIFY the 2022 Order to confirm that the Children shall continue to reside primarily with Mother and to clarify and, as appropriate, adjust the parenting schedule, including but not limited to:

   a. A specific, detailed schedule for Father’s parenting time (for example, alternate weekends and any agreed mid‑week time), including exact start and end times and exchange locations, to reduce potential for conflict; and  
   b. Provisions governing holidays, school vacations, and summer vacation, as the Court deems appropriate, ensuring that the Children enjoy meaningful time with each parent in a structured and predictable manner.

4. CLARIFY and/or MODIFY the parties’ joint legal custody arrangement to better protect the Children from parental conflict, including but not limited to:

   a. Requiring that neither parent enroll the Children in new recurring extracurricular activities, classes, or events that fall substantially during the other parent’s scheduled parenting time without first providing reasonable notice and obtaining the other parent’s consent;  
   b. Providing that, in the absence of mutual agreement, neither parent may unilaterally schedule mandatory, recurring activities during the other parent’s time that would significantly interfere with that parent’s ability to exercise meaningful parenting time;  
   c. Establishing a default rule that, if the parties are unable to agree after good‑faith consultation regarding an activity that will substantially impact the other parent’s parenting time, the activity shall not be scheduled or shall not be considered mandatory during that other parent’s parenting time, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

5. STRENGTHEN the existing non‑disparagement and co‑parenting provisions by ordering that:

   a. Neither parent shall disparage, demean, or blame the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children, including but not limited to statements that the other parent is “selfish,” “does not really love” the Children, or is otherwise at fault for the Children’s inability to attend an event or activity;  
   b. Neither parent shall directly or indirectly communicate to the Children that the other parent is the cause of them missing an activity or event; and  
   c. The parties shall use their best efforts to communicate about scheduling conflicts directly with each other, and not through the Children.

6. ORDER that both parents shall take all reasonable steps to reduce the Children’s anxiety and stress about transitions, including by:

   a. Encouraging the Children to enjoy and respect their time with the other parent;  
   b. Refraining from involving the Children in adult disputes about scheduling or the Court case;  
   c. Communicating about changes in schedule in a timely and respectful manner.

7. AWARD such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the Children, including but not limited to any necessary clarifications of legal and physical custody, decision‑making authority, and dispute‑resolution procedures regarding extracurricular activities and scheduling.
