### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Mark Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Sunny Bistro LLC (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Mark Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located in Quincy, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Sunny Bistro LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its principal place of business at or operating a restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or was otherwise responsible for the maintenance and safety of the premises commonly known as Sunny Bistro, located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action sounding in negligence for personal injuries occurring in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is within the jurisdictional limits of the Massachusetts Superior Court. See G.L. c. 212, § 4.

6. Venue is proper in Norfolk County because the events giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business within Norfolk County. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately evening dinner hours, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a paying customer of Defendant’s restaurant, Sunny Bistro, in Quincy, Massachusetts.

8. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a business invitee to whom Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers of which Defendant knew or should have known. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

9. The restaurant layout included a narrow interior hallway connecting the kitchen area to the dining room and to the restrooms used by customers.

10. During Plaintiff’s dinner at the Premises, a server employed by Defendant was walking through this hallway carrying a tray holding several glasses of water.

11. The server negligently dropped the tray, causing multiple glasses to fall and break on the tile floor of the hallway, leaving broken glass, spilled water, and ice on the floor surface.

12. Immediately following the spill, the server picked up the broken glass shards but did not clean up or adequately dry the water and ice that remained on the tile floor.

13. The server stated, in substance and effect, that she would “be right back with a mop,” indicating her awareness of the hazardous condition of the wet floor.

14. Despite this awareness, the server and other employees of Defendant failed to promptly return with a mop or otherwise remedy the dangerous wet condition on the tile floor.

15. Defendant’s employees did not place any “Wet Floor,” “Caution,” “Piso Mojado,” or other warning signs or cones in or near the hallway where the water and ice remained.

16. Defendant’s employees also failed to block off the area, verbally warn patrons, or otherwise protect customers from walking through the hazardous wet area.

17. Approximately ten (10) minutes after the initial spill, Plaintiff rose from his table in the dining area to use the restroom.

18. In order to reach the restroom, Plaintiff was required to pass through the same narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room where the spill had occurred.

19. At that time, the floor of the hallway remained wet from the spilled water and melting ice.

20. The tile floor in that hallway had a glossy appearance, and the water caused a glistening sheen that, at a glance, could be mistaken for the normal shine of the tile.

21. As Plaintiff walked toward the restroom in a normal and careful manner, he did not observe any warnings or barriers and had no reason to believe that the floor was unsafe.

22. As Plaintiff stepped onto the wet area of the hallway floor, his foot slipped suddenly due to the presence of the water and/or melting ice.

23. Plaintiff’s leg twisted sharply as he lost his footing, causing him to twist and sprain his knee and to fall or nearly fall in the hallway.

24. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in his knee following the slip and twist.

25. After the incident, Plaintiff overheard other staff members employed by Defendant remarking, in substance and effect, that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

26. This statement indicates that Defendant’s employees were aware of the hazardous puddle of water and ice on the hallway floor for a substantial period of time prior to Plaintiff’s fall, and that other staff had themselves been avoiding the dangerous condition rather than promptly correcting it.

27. Defendant’s employees, acting within the scope of their employment, had actual knowledge of the wet and slippery condition of the tile floor in the hallway for at least several minutes—sufficient time to either remedy the hazard or adequately warn customers.

28. Alternatively, and/or in addition, Defendant, through its employees, had constructive notice of the hazardous condition because the puddle existed for a sufficient period of time and was in a high-traffic area where reasonable inspection would have discovered it. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

29. Following his slip and knee injury, Plaintiff left the Premises and sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility.

30. At urgent care, Plaintiff underwent examination and was diagnosed with a knee sprain.

31. Plaintiff was prescribed or provided with a knee brace for stabilization and support.

32. Plaintiff was further referred to and underwent a course of physical therapy over the following weeks.

33. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,800 in medical expenses, including but not limited to urgent care visits, diagnostic services, brace costs, and physical therapy.

34. As a further direct and proximate result of his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time and/or had to miss work, causing him approximately $500 in lost wages.

35. Plaintiff also suffered pain, discomfort, and physical limitations in his daily activities during the period of recovery, including difficulty walking, climbing stairs, performing household tasks, and engaging in normal recreational activities.

36. Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

37. At all relevant times, the creation and continuation of the hazardous condition on the floor was due to the acts and omissions of Defendant’s employees acting within the course and scope of their employment.

38. Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and servants under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See *Worcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc.*, 408 Mass. 393 (1990).

39. Defendant also bears direct liability for failing to implement and enforce reasonable safety and inspection policies to ensure that spills and wet floors in customer pathways are corrected promptly or that adequate warnings are provided.

40. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to maintain the Premises, including the hallway between the kitchen and dining room, in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers that were known or reasonably should have been known to Defendant. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Rossley v. S.S. Kresge Co.*, 339 Mass. 654 (1959).

41. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things:

   a. Failing to promptly clean or dry the spilled water and ice in the hallway;

   b. Failing to place any warning signs or cones alerting customers to the presence of a wet and slippery floor;

   c. Failing to block off the hazardous area or otherwise prevent customers from entering it;

   d. Failing to adequately inspect and monitor a known wet condition in a high-traffic customer area;

   e. Failing to have or follow reasonable policies and procedures to address spills and wet floors in customer walkways;

   f. Allowing the dangerous condition to remain for an unreasonable length of time after actual knowledge of the spill; and

   g. Prioritizing employee convenience over customer safety, as evidenced by staff “dodging” the puddle instead of remedying it.

42. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip, fall, and resulting injuries. See *J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio, Tort Law* (2d ed.), cited in *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006).

43. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of the dangerous condition, did not have equal knowledge of the hazard, and was not comparatively negligent under G.L. c. 231, § 85. Plaintiff proceeded in a normal and reasonable manner along the only available path to the restroom, in the absence of any warnings or barriers.

44. Any contention that the puddle was “open and obvious” is without merit under the circumstances because (a) the shiny tile appearance could reasonably obscure the presence of water; and (b) even where a danger is open and obvious, a landowner may remain liable where it should anticipate that visitors will encounter the condition despite its obviousness. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

45. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred special damages (medical expenses and lost wages) in an amount currently estimated at approximately $2,300, and will incur additional damages including but not limited to pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined at trial.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

46. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 45 as if fully set forth herein.

47. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers of which it knows or reasonably should know. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

48. Defendant, as owner and/or operator of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the interior hallway between the kitchen and dining room, including the route to the restrooms, in a reasonably safe condition.

49. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to make reasonable inspections of the Premises and to remedy or warn of any unreasonably dangerous conditions, including liquid or ice on floors in customer walkways. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780 (2007); *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

50. Defendant, through its employees and agents, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known that a large quantity of water and ice had been spilled on the tile floor of the hallway and remained there for a significant period of time.

51. Defendant, through its employees and agents, created the hazardous condition when its server dropped the tray and allowed water and ice to remain on the floor.

52. Where the defendant or its employees created the hazardous condition, Plaintiff is not required to prove the duration of the hazard to establish notice; notice is inferred. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 786–87 (2007).

53. Even if Defendant had not directly created the hazard, the facts alleged show that Defendant had actual notice of the condition because its server acknowledged the need to retrieve a mop and other staff admitted “dodging that puddle” for a period of time.

54. Alternatively and/or in addition, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazardous condition because it existed for such a length of time that, in the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant should have discovered and corrected it. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

55. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by failing to act as a reasonably prudent restaurant owner would under the circumstances, including, but not limited to:

   a. Failing to promptly mop, dry, or otherwise remove the spilled water and ice from the tile floor;

   b. Failing to set out any form of warning sign, cone, or barricade to alert patrons to the wet floor condition;

   c. Failing to warn Plaintiff verbally of the hazard, despite actual knowledge thereof;

   d. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable spill-response procedures for high-traffic customer areas; and

   e. Allowing the hazard to persist despite employees’ awareness and avoidance of the puddle.

56. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care applicable to reasonable restaurant operators and premises owners under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., *Thurlow v. Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc.*, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 175 (2000) (grocery store negligence for failure to remedy liquid on floor); *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560 (1955) (store’s duty to maintain floors in safe condition).

57. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped on the wet tile floor, twisted and sprained his knee, and suffered the injuries and damages described herein.

58. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. See *Craig v. Everett M. Brooks Co.*, 351 Mass. 497, 501 (1967).

59. Plaintiff’s reasonable medical expenses to date total approximately $1,800.

60. Plaintiff’s lost wages to date total approximately $500.

61. Plaintiff also has suffered and will continue to suffer pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

62. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any comparative negligence, if any, attributed to Plaintiff is less than the negligence of Defendant, and Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover his damages, reduced only by any percentage of negligence attributed to him, if any.

63. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all injuries and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other general and special damages recognized under Massachusetts law. See *Griffin v. General Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362 (1980).

---

### V. DAMAGES

64. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages, among others:

   a. Past medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,800;

   b. Past lost wages in the approximate amount of $500;

   c. Physical pain and suffering, including knee pain and limitations in mobility;

   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish associated with the injury and recovery;

   e. Loss of enjoyment of life and inability to engage in normal daily activities and recreation during the period of disability;

   f. Inconvenience and disruption of Plaintiff’s personal and work life; and

   g. Other damages to be proven at trial.

65. Plaintiff seeks compensation for all such damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, together with interest and costs as provided by law, including prejudgment interest under G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Mark Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Sunny Bistro LLC, and award the following relief:

A. On Count I (Negligence), an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, sufficient to fully and fairly compensate Plaintiff for:

   2. Past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity, if any;  
   3. Past and future pain and suffering;  
   4. Emotional distress and mental anguish; and
