### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Jessica Taylor (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Emily Rodriguez (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Taylor is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Emily Rodriguez is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner, landlord, and person in control of the three‑unit residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, managed, and/or was responsible for maintenance of the exterior premises and sidewalk areas appurtenant to the Property, including the sidewalk and walkways adjacent to 123 Maple Street (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence seeking recovery for personal injuries arising from a slip‑and‑fall incident that occurred on February 10, 2023, at the Premises in Worcester, Massachusetts.

5. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 212, § 3, the amount in controversy—approximately $3,300 in special damages to date, plus pain and suffering and other damages—is within the civil jurisdiction of the Worcester District Court.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the events and occurrences giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims took place in Worcester, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Worcester Division of the District Court Department. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Defendant owns and/or controls a three‑unit residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

8. The sidewalk and access walkway in front of and leading to the entrances of the Property are appurtenant to the Premises and under the care, custody, and control of Defendant as owner and landlord.

9. On or about early February 2023, a winter snowstorm deposited a significant accumulation of snow on and around the sidewalk and walkway in front of 123 Maple Street.

10. Following that storm, Defendant undertook to shovel and clear the sidewalk area. Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk, leaving snow, slush, and ice along the sides of the path.

11. Defendant failed to apply any salt, sand, or other de‑icing or traction materials to the path or surrounding surfaces after shoveling.

12. Over the days following the storm, the temperature cycled above and below freezing, causing snow and ice to melt during the day and refreeze at night.

13. As a result of this melt‑and‑refreeze cycle, the narrow shoveled path on the sidewalk in front of the Premises developed into a dangerous sheet of ice, without adequate traction and without adequate visual warning.

14. Upon information and belief, tenants of the Property observed that the shoveled path had become extremely icy and dangerous.

15. Upon information and belief, prior to February 10, 2023, tenants of the Property texted Defendant, sent her photographs, and otherwise notified her that the sidewalk and narrow path had become dangerously icy and required sanding, salting, or further treatment.

16. Upon information and belief, in response to such complaints and photographs, Defendant told the tenants words to the effect of “the sun will take care of it,” and took no further reasonable steps to treat or remediate the ice hazard.

17. On February 10, 2023, at approximately a date within this melt‑and‑refreeze period, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises, delivering groceries to one of Defendant’s tenants at 123 Maple Street.

18. Plaintiff was an invitee and/or lawful visitor, present on the Premises for a purpose reasonably anticipated by Defendant, and walking upon the sidewalk and access path that Defendant had shoveled and left untreated.

19. Plaintiff walked along the narrow shoveled path in front of the Property in the ordinary, reasonable manner that a person would use in accessing the Premises.

20. Without adequate warning and without any sanding or salting of the area, Plaintiff encountered a large, invisible or hard‑to‑discern patch of ice that had formed on the shoveled path.

21. Plaintiff’s feet abruptly slipped out from under her on the ice, causing her to fall forcefully backward to the ground, landing on her lower back.

22. The fall was sudden, unexpected, and violent, and occurred as a direct result of the slick, untreated, and dangerously icy condition of the sidewalk.

23. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the creation of the hazardous icy condition; she was merely using the sidewalk in the manner it was intended to be used.

24. The ice patch on which Plaintiff slipped was a condition that had developed over time due to the melt‑and‑refreeze cycle and Defendant’s failure to take reasonable remedial measures despite notice.

25. The tenants’ prior complaints, text messages, and photographs put Defendant on actual notice of the recurring, ongoing dangerous condition on the sidewalk.

26. Even in the absence of actual notice, the dangerous icy condition existed for a sufficient period of time, and under such weather conditions, that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the hazard and remedied it. Defendant therefore also had constructive notice of the condition.

27. Defendant failed to inspect the sidewalk adequately, failed to apply salt, sand, or other de‑icing agents, failed to widen the path or remove additional accumulations, and failed to close off or warn of the hazard.

28. Defendant instead consciously chose to rely on weather and “the sun” to eliminate the accumulated ice, despite being warned and having the ability to take reasonable steps to make the sidewalk safe.

29. As a direct and proximate result of slipping and falling on the ice, Plaintiff suffered injuries to her lower back and related musculoskeletal structures.

30. Plaintiff experienced immediate pain and discomfort in her lower back following the fall, requiring medical evaluation and treatment.

31. Plaintiff sought and obtained medical treatment for her injuries, including but not limited to examinations, diagnostic procedures, and follow‑up care, incurring approximately $2,500 in medical expenses to date.

32. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to perform her job duties and missed approximately one week of work, resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.

33. Plaintiff has endured physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities as a result of the injuries sustained from the fall.

34. Plaintiff has suffered, and may continue to suffer, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and interference with her usual activities due to her injuries.

35. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused by Defendant’s negligence and failure to maintain the Premises—including the sidewalk and access path—in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors such as Plaintiff.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**NEGLIGENCE**

36. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 35 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

37. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of real property owes all lawful visitors a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973).

38. This duty of reasonable care extends to the maintenance of exterior areas appurtenant to the property, including sidewalks, walkways, and means of ingress and egress that tenants and their invitees may reasonably be expected to use. *Dipasquale v. Gow*, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 628 (1975); *Luz v. Stop & Shop, Inc. of Peabody*, 348 Mass. 198, 202 (1964).

39. A landlord who retains control over common areas, such as walkways used by multiple tenants and their guests, is obligated to exercise reasonable care to keep such areas in a condition reasonably safe for their intended use. *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 166–68 (1980); *Cataruzza v. Western Mass. Elec. Co.*, 412 Mass. 445, 448 (1992).

40. Defendant, as owner and person in control of the Premises and the sidewalk in question, owed Plaintiff, a lawful visitor delivering groceries to a tenant, a duty to use reasonable care to keep the sidewalk and access path in a reasonably safe condition, including by addressing known or reasonably foreseeable hazards such as snow and ice accumulations.

**Breach**

41. Massachusetts law requires landowners to act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances in maintaining their property, including addressing hazards created by snow and ice. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 383–84 (2010) (abolishing the “natural accumulation” rule and holding that property owners owe the same duty of reasonable care for risks arising from snow and ice as for all other hazards); *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 435 Mass. 353, 360–61 (2001).

42. By shoveling only a narrow path and failing to apply salt, sand, or de‑icing material, and then consciously choosing not to take further action after being notified that the path had become an icy, dangerous condition, Defendant failed to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would under the circumstances.

43. Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous condition due to tenants’ text messages, photographs, and complaints regarding the icy condition and the risk it posed to those using the sidewalk.

44. Even apart from actual notice, the recurring melt‑and‑refreeze condition following a significant snowstorm created a foreseeable risk that the shoveled path would become dangerously icy, such that a reasonable property owner would have taken steps to inspect and treat the area. See *Aylward v. McCloskey*, 412 Mass. 77, 80–81 (1992) (constructive notice where hazard existed for sufficient time and under circumstances where landowner should have discovered it).

45. Defendant’s failure to inspect, treat, sand, salt, or otherwise remediate the icy sidewalk—and her decision to rely solely on the “sun” to address the hazard—constitutes a breach of her duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the Premises.

46. Defendant also failed to post warnings, cones, signs, or barriers to alert lawful visitors, including Plaintiff, to the dangerous icy condition or to divert them to a safer route.

47. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care that a reasonable property owner and landlord would employ in similar circumstances, in violation of her common‑law duty of reasonable care. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (duty to act reasonably in light of foreseeable risks); *Dubois v. Debreuil*, 304 Mass. 229, 231 (1939).

**Causation**

48. But for Defendant’s failure to properly treat or remediate the icy condition on the sidewalk, Plaintiff would not have slipped, fallen, and suffered injury on February 10, 2023.

49. The hazardous condition of the ice‑covered shoveled path was a direct and substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s fall and resultant injuries. See *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983) (substantial factor causation standard).

50. Plaintiff’s injuries were the reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition and failure to remedy a known and obvious hazard created or exacerbated by her own inadequate snow‑removal efforts. See *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 383–84.

51. Plaintiff did not engage in any unreasonable conduct that would have independently caused her injuries; she was using the sidewalk in a normal, foreseeable manner. Any allegation of contributory negligence is without merit. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any comparative negligence by Plaintiff, which is denied, would not bar recovery but would merely reduce damages in proportion to any such fault.

**Damages**

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries to her lower back and associated structures, resulting in pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities.

53. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately $2,500 for examination, diagnosis, and treatment of her injuries.

54. Plaintiff also suffered lost wages of approximately $800 due to missing about one week of work while recovering from her injuries.

55. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience pain and suffering, discomfort, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the injuries sustained from the fall.

56. Plaintiff reasonably anticipates additional pain and suffering and possibly additional medical care in the future as a result of the injuries.

57. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover compensatory damages from Defendant for past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and all other damages recoverable under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 85, 85K; *Dobos v. Driscoll*, 404 Mass. 634, 640–41 (1989).

---

### V. LEGAL BASIS AND AUTHORITIES

58. Plaintiff’s claim for negligence arises under Massachusetts common law and applicable statutes, including but not limited to:

   a. The common‑law duty of reasonable care owed by landowners and persons in control of property to lawful visitors. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

   b. The application of this duty to snow and ice conditions, abolishing any distinction between “natural” and “unnatural” accumulations. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).

   c. The duty of landlords to maintain common areas under their control, including walkways used by tenants and their invitees. *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. at 166–68; *Dipasquale v. Gow*, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 626 (1975).

   d. The requirement that property owners take reasonable steps to inspect for and remedy hazards for which they have actual or constructive notice. *Aylward v. McCloskey*, 412 Mass. 77 (1992); *Luz v. Stop & Shop, Inc. of Peabody*, 348 Mass. 198 (1964).

   e. The general principles of negligence in Massachusetts: duty, breach, causation, and damages. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983).

   f. The comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, governing allocation of fault, if any, between parties.

   g. The jurisdictional statutes governing the District Court and civil actions, including G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A, and venue statutes including G.L. c. 223, §§ 1–2.

59. Plaintiff’s claim is timely under the three‑year statute of limitations for tort actions. See G.L. c. 260, § 2A; *White v. Peabody Constr. Co.*, 386 Mass. 121, 129–30 (1982).
