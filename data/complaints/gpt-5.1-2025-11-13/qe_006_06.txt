                            COMPLAINT
          (Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, §14)

Plaintiff Jessica Martin (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Thomas Reynolds (“Defendant”), states and alleges as follows:

                              PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martin is an individual residing in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

2. Plaintiff is a residential tenant of the premises located at 250 Main Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, MA 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. Defendant Thomas Reynolds is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises.

4. At all times relevant, Defendant was responsible for maintaining the Premises in compliance with applicable law, including but not limited to:  
   a. G.L. c. 186 (Landlord and Tenant); and  
   b. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

                       JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21 and G.L. c. 185C, §3, because this is a civil action arising under Massachusetts landlord–tenant law for money damages not exceeding the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §2 and G.L. c. 223, §8, because the Premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the cause of action arose in this county.

                            STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has continuously rented and occupied the Premises as her home since on or about January 1, 2022.

9. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

10. The tenancy is a residential tenancy within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, and Defendant is a landlord within the meaning of that statute.

11. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to comply with her material obligations under the tenancy, including payment of rent.

12. Massachusetts law implies into every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment, both at common law and pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

13. Under the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., a landlord is required to provide and maintain in good working order adequate hot water for tenants. See 105 C.M.R. 410.190 (Hot Water); 105 C.M.R. 410.200 (Heating Facilities).

14. On or about early November 2025, approximately three weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint, the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment at the Premises ceased functioning.

15. After the loss of hot water, Plaintiff’s apartment did not have adequate hot water for normal residential use, including bathing, washing dishes, and cleaning.

16. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water on the same day she discovered that the hot water was not working.

17. Defendant responded that the water heater needed a replacement part and that he had ordered the necessary part.

18. Approximately one week later, the hot water was still not functioning. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant, who stated that the part was “backordered.”

19. Approximately two weeks after the initial loss of hot water, Plaintiff continued to be without hot water. Defendant again told Plaintiff that he was still waiting on the part and that the supplier had not shipped it.

20. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water in the Premises for approximately three consecutive weeks.

21. Throughout that time, Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of the continuing lack of hot water.

22. Defendant has acknowledged the problem, but despite having notice and a reasonable time to correct it, Defendant has failed to restore hot water to the Premises.

23. The complete loss of hot water for an extended period constitutes a serious and substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of a residential dwelling unit, and renders the conditions at the Premises unsafe and in violation of the State Sanitary Code. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–01 (1979); Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973).

24. Massachusetts courts have held that conditions which violate the State Sanitary Code and materially impact the habitability of an apartment can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, §14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

25. A residential tenant’s right to hot water is a basic necessity required for decent, safe, and sanitary housing under state law, and the absence of hot water is recognized as a substantial defect affecting habitability. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 200–01; McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 310–11 (1977).

26. As a direct result of the lack of hot water for approximately three weeks, Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers in her home or to avoid bathing there altogether.

27. Plaintiff has had to boil water on the stove in order to wash dishes and to maintain basic cleanliness within the Premises.

28. Because of the lack of hot water, Plaintiff has been compelled to obtain access to showers at a gym away from her home, which she pays approximately $30 per month for membership, plus additional costs for gas and travel.

29. The lack of hot water has been especially burdensome with respect to Plaintiff’s infant child, whom Plaintiff has been forced to bathe at her mother’s house because she cannot safely bathe the baby in cold water.

30. Plaintiff’s need to travel to her mother’s house to bathe her baby has caused inconvenience, disruption of family life, and additional expense.

31. The loss of hot water for an extended period has caused Plaintiff physical discomfort, distress, inconvenience, and embarrassment.

32. Defendant’s failure to timely restore hot water after notice is not excused by the alleged delay of a supplier or the backorder of a part, as Defendant remains responsible under Massachusetts law for maintaining essential services. See McAllister v. Boston Hous. Auth., 429 Mass. 300, 303–04 (1999); Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 200–01.

33. Defendant has had actual knowledge of the lack of hot water since Plaintiff first reported the condition in or about early November 2025 and at all times thereafter.

34. Despite that knowledge and multiple opportunities, Defendant has failed to provide a temporary hot water solution (such as repair, replacement of the water heater, or alternative means of providing hot water) within a reasonable time.

35. The complete loss of hot water for three weeks or more, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, constitutes a “serious interference” with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §14. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

36. Defendant’s conduct and inaction, in the face of known, ongoing violations of the State Sanitary Code affecting essential services, constitutes at least negligent, if not willful, conduct that has interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983.

37. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a result of Defendant’s breach, including but not limited to:  
   a. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises during the period without hot water;  
   b. Out-of-pocket costs for transportation and gym membership to access hot showers;  
   c. Additional travel and associated costs to bathe her baby at her mother’s home; and  
   d. Physical discomfort, loss of use, and emotional distress arising from the conditions.

38. Plaintiff estimates that she is owed at least $600.00 in damages associated with Defendant’s breach of her right to quiet enjoyment for the period described.

39. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to increase the demand for damages based on additional information, time without hot water, or further harm suffered.

40. All conditions precedent to the bringing of this action have occurred, been performed, or have been waived.

                         COUNT I  
         BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
             (G.L. c. 186, §14 – Sole Cause of Action)

41. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. Under G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and is liable for damages where such interference is caused by any act or omission.

43. The statute provides that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” G.L. c. 186, §14.

44. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is also implied in every residential lease and tenancy at common law, and protects a tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises free from serious interferences caused by the landlord or those for whom the landlord is legally responsible. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 715–19; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

45. Conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code and seriously affect health or safety, when known to the landlord and not corrected within a reasonable time, constitute an interference with the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 200–01; McKenna, 5 Mass. App. Ct. at 310–11.

46. The provision of adequate hot water is an essential service required by the State Sanitary Code for residential habitability. See 105 C.M.R. 410.190.

47. Defendant had actual knowledge that Plaintiff’s apartment was without hot water beginning in or about early November 2025 and continuing for at least three weeks thereafter.

48. Defendant failed to restore hot water or to provide any adequate temporary remedy within a reasonable time, despite repeated notice and the serious, ongoing nature of the violation.

49. Defendant’s failure to repair or otherwise provide hot water within a reasonable time following notice, while continuing to accept rent, constitutes an “omission” that indirectly and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises. See Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85; McAllister, 429 Mass. at 303–04.

50. Defendant’s conduct and inaction were at least negligent, and in light of the continuing violation and the length of time without hot water after multiple notifications, may also be found willful or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 851–52; Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983.

51. The loss of hot water for an extended period deprived Plaintiff of the ordinary, comfortable, and safe use of her home, amounting to a substantial interference with her quiet enjoyment.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Diminished rental value of the Premises;  
    b. Out-of-pocket costs for gym membership and additional travel;  
    c. Disruption to daily life and to the care of her infant child;  
    d. Physical discomfort and inconvenience; and  
    e. Emotional distress associated with living without hot water.

53. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees (recognizing that Plaintiff is self-represented but preserving any recoverable costs under the statute).

54. Plaintiff presently estimates her damages at no less than $600.00; however, under G.L. c. 186, §14, the measure of statutory damages may be calculated as three times Plaintiff’s monthly rent of $1,200.00 (i.e., $3,600.00), or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, subject to the Court’s determination based on the evidence. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 110–11; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 851–52.

55. Plaintiff seeks all relief available under G.L. c. 186, §14 for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and any additional damages, costs, and statutory remedies as the Court deems just and proper.

                           PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Martin respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Reynolds, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant breached Plaintiff’s covenant and statutory right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, §14;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, §14 in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $600.00, and up to the full measure of statutory damages (including, as applicable, three months’ rent and/or actual and consequential damages), together with any additional compensatory damages supported by the evidence;

C. An award of Plaintiff’s court costs and allowable expenses of this action, including the filing fee and any other recoverable costs under G.L. c. 186, §14;

D. Such further and other relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and proper.

                        DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA MARTIN
