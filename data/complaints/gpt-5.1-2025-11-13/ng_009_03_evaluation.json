In reviewing the alleged excessiveness of the verdict, the court expressly lists and accepts a wide range of injury-related elements the jury could consider, which aligns with the notion of \u2018full and fair\u2019 compensation for all proximately caused injuries and damages. However, it does not separately analyze items like medical expenses or property damage, so its support is indirect rather than an explicit doctrinal statement.",

Instead, it interprets G.L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F regarding paid leave for incapacitated police officers, issues about resignation, and offsets for insurance, in a statutory employment-benefits context. It therefore does not provide authority for the broad proposition about \u2018full and fair compensation\u2019 for all tort damages under Massachusetts negligence law.",
