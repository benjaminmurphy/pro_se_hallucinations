It does not address or delineate the full range of damages recoverable by the directly injured plaintiff for personal injury (such as medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, or loss of enjoyment of life), nor does it interpret G.L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6B or 85. Thus it is not authority for the generic proposition about all categories of damages recoverable in a negligence personal injury action.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"We hold that the Ferriter children have a viable claim for loss of parental society if they can show that they are minors dependent on the parent, Michael Ferriter... We turn to the plaintiffs' claims for negligent infliction of mental distress and impaired health... We think that the present case is within the principles set out in Dziokonski.... The Workmen's Compensation Act does not bar the plaintiffs' claims for loss of consortium and society... We conclude that the King rule applies to the plaintiffs' claims for negligent infliction of mental distress, and those claims are not barred.\""
