v.  

MICHAEL THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

--------------------------------  
I. PARTIES  
--------------------------------  

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual who resides in Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual and the owner and/or manager of the residential rental premises located at 252 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605 (“the Premises”). Upon information and belief, Defendant’s principal place of business and/or residence is in Worcester County, Massachusetts.

--------------------------------  
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
--------------------------------  

3. This action is brought pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in a residential tenancy.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 19A, because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court Department.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 6, because the Premises are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester County.

--------------------------------  
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
--------------------------------  

6. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 252 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment since on or about January 15, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord and person responsible for maintenance, repair, and habitability of the Premises, including common areas and structural and pest-control conditions.

9. The tenancy is a residential tenancy for dwelling purposes under Massachusetts law and is governed by G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, as well as the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

10. Approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen, including on counters, in cabinets, and near stored food.

11. Plaintiff exercised reasonable cleanliness and kept her kitchen in a clean and sanitary condition, regularly cleaning surfaces and properly disposing of trash.

12. Upon discovering mouse droppings, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent problem.

13. Defendant initially responded by placing a few mouse traps in the Apartment.

14. The traps caught approximately two mice, but Plaintiff continued to find fresh mouse droppings on a regular basis.

15. Plaintiff again notified Defendant that the rodent problem persisted and that mouse droppings were still appearing in the kitchen.

16. Defendant responded by claiming that the presence of mice was “normal for older buildings” and suggesting that Plaintiff “needed to keep [her] kitchen cleaner.”

17. Plaintiff, who already maintained a high level of cleanliness, reasonably understood these comments to be dismissive, inaccurate, and unfairly blaming her for a building-wide pest issue beyond her control.

18. Defendant arranged for an exterminator to visit the Premises on one occasion.

19. During that visit, the exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building likely required a more comprehensive and ongoing treatment plan to address the rodent infestation effectively.

20. Plaintiff relayed to Defendant the exterminator’s opinion that further and more comprehensive extermination measures were needed to remedy the problem properly.

21. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for the recommended comprehensive treatment, stating that it was “overkill” and “too expensive.”

22. Following the single exterminator visit, Plaintiff continued to experience evidence of mice, including fresh droppings in her kitchen on a weekly basis.

23. Because of the ongoing rodent problem, Plaintiff was forced to discard food that she reasonably believed had been contaminated or exposed to mice or mouse droppings, including boxed and bagged food that was not sealed and could not be reliably cleaned or salvaged.

24. Over the course of approximately three months, Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has discarded approximately $200.00 worth of food due to contamination or likely contamination from the rodent infestation.

25. In addition, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers and other supplies to protect her food from rodents, at a cost of approximately $80.00.

26. Plaintiff’s total out-of-pocket damages related to the rodent problem, including discarded food and storage containers, is approximately $280.00.

27. Plaintiff has been continually anxious and distressed about cooking, eating, or preparing food in her own kitchen, given the ongoing presence of mouse droppings and the risk of contamination and disease.

28. Plaintiff’s normal use and enjoyment of the kitchen and of the Apartment as a whole has been substantially interfered with. She has had to change how and where she stores food, how she uses her kitchen, and how often she must clean and inspect for droppings.

29. The presence of mice and recurrent mouse droppings in a residential kitchen constitutes a condition that may endanger or materially impair the health, safety, or well-being of occupants, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and 105 C.M.R. 410.602.

30. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.550(B), the owner of a dwelling containing two or more units is responsible for maintaining the premises free from rodent infestation and is required to exterminate rodents when necessary.

31. As owner and landlord, Defendant was and is responsible for ensuring that the Premises are maintained in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, including keeping the Apartment and building free from rodent infestation and conditions conducive to infestation.

32. Defendant has failed to take adequate, effective, and ongoing steps to exterminate mice and prevent further infestation, despite actual notice of the rodent problem and its persistence over several months.

33. Defendant’s failure to properly address the rodent infestation has resulted in an ongoing and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

34. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been serious and material, not trivial or de minimis, and has affected essential aspects of habitability and daily living, including the ability to safely store and prepare food and to live without undue anxiety about rodents.

35. Plaintiff has remained current in the payment of rent at all relevant times, or, to the extent of any nonpayment, such nonpayment has been the result of Defendant’s failure to meet his legal obligations regarding habitability and quiet enjoyment.

36. Plaintiff has made good-faith efforts to resolve the matter informally with Defendant, but Defendant has refused to undertake the comprehensive extermination and repairs necessary to remedy the problem, leaving Plaintiff with no adequate remedy other than this lawsuit.

--------------------------------  
IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
--------------------------------  

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. Under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s right to the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

39. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.

40. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that serious and ongoing conditions that materially impair a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where his actions set in motion circumstances causing significant interference with quiet enjoyment); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (persistent flooding and landlord’s failure to remedy conditions supported quiet enjoyment claim).

41. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is also implicated when a landlord fails to remedy conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code and materially interfere with the tenant’s lawful use of the premises. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (quiet enjoyment breach where landlord’s acts and omissions caused severe and persistent habitability problems); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994).

42. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord’s liability for quiet enjoyment does not require proof of malice or intent to harm; it is sufficient that the landlord knew or reasonably should have known of the conditions and failed to take reasonable steps to correct them, thereby causing substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994).

43. In addition, Massachusetts law recognizes an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, under which a landlord must maintain premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, and violations of the Code that significantly affect habitability can support or overlap with a quiet enjoyment claim. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 307–08 (1977).

44. The presence of a rodent infestation in a dwelling unit, particularly in kitchen and food-preparation areas, is a condition that violates the State Sanitary Code and materially endangers or impairs the health and welfare of occupants. See 105 C.M.R. 410.550; 105 C.M.R. 410.602; see also Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (Code violations, including infestations, support tenant’s claims).

45. Massachusetts regulations place the responsibility for exterminating rodents on the owner/landlord in buildings with multiple dwelling units. 105 C.M.R. 410.550(B). A landlord’s failure to fulfill this duty, when it results in significant interference with habitability, can constitute an indirect interference with quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 789–90.

46. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent problem in Plaintiff’s Apartment, through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and through the exterminator’s own assessment that the building required more comprehensive treatment.

47. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable and sufficient actions to eliminate the rodent infestation and prevent its recurrence, instead providing only limited and ineffective measures (a few traps and a single exterminator visit), and expressly refusing to authorize the comprehensive treatment recommended by the exterminator.

48. Defendant’s refusal to provide appropriate extermination and remediation, in light of his knowledge of the ongoing infestation and Sanitary Code obligations, constitutes an unreasonable failure to act, and therefore an indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

49. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to remedy the rodent infestation, Plaintiff has been subjected to ongoing and substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of her home, including:

    a. The recurring presence of mouse droppings in the kitchen and food-preparation areas;

    b. The contamination and loss of food, requiring Plaintiff to discard approximately $200.00 worth of groceries and supplies;

    c. The need to purchase plastic containers and other protective storage for food, costing approximately $80.00;

    d. Persistent anxiety, discomfort, and distress about using her kitchen and about the health and safety implications of rodents and droppings; and

    e. A significant reduction in the comfort, security, and normal use of her dwelling.

50. The cumulative effect of these conditions and Defendant’s inaction has been to substantially and materially impair Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03 (repeated, serious conditions and failure to repair supported quiet enjoyment damages); Doe, 417 Mass. at 285–86.

51. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is not minor or trivial; it has persisted for several months, involves insanitary and unhealthy conditions, and directly affects Plaintiff’s core use of her home, particularly her kitchen.

52. Plaintiff’s damages are actual and consequential and are directly attributable to Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including out-of-pocket expenses, loss of food, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

53. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent at the rate of $1,200.00 per month, whichever is greater, together with costs of the action and a reasonable attorney’s fee. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 790–91 (statutory minimum of three months’ rent applies regardless of actual damages); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

54. Although Plaintiff is self-represented and therefore not presently incurring attorney’s fees, she reserves the right to seek fees if subsequently represented or as otherwise permitted by law; at a minimum, she is entitled to her taxable costs of this action.

55. In addition to monetary relief, Massachusetts courts have the power to order injunctive and equitable relief to compel landlords to abate and repair conditions that violate tenants’ rights. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 203; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03. Plaintiff therefore seeks an order requiring Defendant to take all reasonable and necessary steps to remedy the rodent infestation and maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code.

--------------------------------

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Michael Thompson, and grant the following relief:

D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E. Reasonable attorney’s fees to the extent Plaintiff becomes represented by counsel or as otherwise permitted under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
