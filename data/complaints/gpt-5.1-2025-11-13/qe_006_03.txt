CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff, Jessica Rivera (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Rivera”), for her complaint against Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Rivera is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, where Plaintiff resides as a tenant. Defendant’s address is unknown to Plaintiff but is believed to be within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, specifically G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, the District Court Department has jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy is within the court’s jurisdictional limits.

5. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 & 2 because the leased premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for residential premises located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”), with Defendant as landlord.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises as a residential tenant since on or about June 1, 2022.

8. Plaintiff’s current monthly rent for the Premises is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord and person responsible for maintaining the Premises in compliance with applicable law, including the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., and applicable provisions of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

10. The Premises is a “dwelling unit” within the meaning of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.020.

11. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.190(A), every dwelling unit must be supplied with hot water sufficient in quantity and pressure to meet ordinary demands and at a temperature of not less than 110°F measured at the tap.

12. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.200, the owner (Defendant) is responsible for providing and maintaining in good operating condition all facilities for heating water, unless there is a lawful written agreement placing that responsibility on the occupant, which there is not in this case.

13. Approximately three weeks before the filing of this Complaint, in or about early November 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment at the Premises ceased functioning, resulting in no hot water at the taps in Plaintiff’s unit (the “Hot Water Outage”).

14. Plaintiff immediately discovered that the apartment lacked hot water for normal residential uses, including bathing, washing dishes, and other sanitary purposes.

15. On the same day that the Hot Water Outage began, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the lack of hot water.

16. Defendant responded that the water heater needed a replacement part and that he had ordered it.

17. Approximately one week later, Plaintiff still had no hot water at the Premises.

18. Plaintiff contacted Defendant again after that first week had elapsed with no restoration of hot water.

19. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the needed part for the water heater was “backordered” and that he was waiting for the supplier.

20. Approximately two full weeks after the Hot Water Outage began, Plaintiff continued to be without hot water.

21. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant after the second week without hot water and was told essentially the same information—that the part was backordered and Defendant was “working on it.”

22. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water for approximately three weeks.

23. During this three-week period, Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers in her apartment or to find hot water elsewhere.

24. To maintain minimally sanitary bathing conditions, Plaintiff has purchased and used a gym membership costing approximately $30 per month for the purpose of accessing showers with hot water.

25. Plaintiff has also incurred additional transportation costs, including gasoline expenses, to travel to the gym for showers because of the lack of hot water at the Premises.

26. Plaintiff is the parent of a baby who resides with her at the Premises.

27. Due to the absence of hot water, Plaintiff has been unable to bathe her baby safely in her own apartment.

28. As a result, Plaintiff has taken her baby to her mother’s house for baths, thereby disrupting her normal family routines, causing inconvenience, stress, and additional travel time and costs.

29. Plaintiff has also been forced to boil water on the stove in order to wash dishes and maintain basic household sanitation in the Premises.

30. The lack of hot water for this extended period has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises as a habitable and sanitary residence.

31. Defendant has been aware, since the day the Hot Water Outage began, that Plaintiff’s apartment lacked hot water.

32. Despite this knowledge, Defendant has allowed the condition to persist for approximately three weeks as of the filing of this Complaint.

33. Although Defendant has communicated with Plaintiff and has represented that he is “working on it,” he has failed to timely remedy the condition and has not provided an alternative source of hot water or any rent abatement.

34. The complete absence of hot water for weeks at a time violates the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190–410.200, and renders the Premises in substantial noncompliance with applicable health and housing standards.

35. The lack of hot water is a condition that materially impairs the use and enjoyment of the Premises by Plaintiff as a residence.

36. Defendant, as landlord, has a non-delegable duty to maintain hot water facilities in good working order in compliance with 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

37. Defendant’s failure to correct the Hot Water Outage within a reasonable period of time after notice constitutes a breach of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

38. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss, inconvenience, annoyance, emotional distress, and out-of-pocket expenses, including but not limited to the gym membership cost, additional transportation costs, and the loss of the value of a habitable apartment with adequate hot water, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to restore hot water.

39. Based on these harms and the deprivation of a basic service required for safe and habitable occupancy, Plaintiff reasonably estimates her damages at no less than Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00), exclusive of statutory multiples, costs, and attorney’s fees (if any).

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

40. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 39 as if fully set forth herein.

41. Massachusetts law implies in every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment, protecting tenants from serious interference with their tenancy rights by the landlord or by those acting on the landlord’s behalf. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see, e.g., *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

42. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant shall be liable for actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

43. A substantial or significant interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, especially where it involves violations of the State Sanitary Code or conditions affecting health and safety, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Watson v. Fitchburg Hous. Auth.*, 424 Mass. 193, 195–97 (1997); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

44. Landlord liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 arises where the landlord, after receiving notice of serious conditions affecting habitability, fails to take reasonable steps to remedy them within a reasonable time. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994).

45. Violations of the State Sanitary Code, including failure to provide hot water, can constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 200–04 (1979); *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973); *McKenna v. Begin*, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977).

46. At all relevant times, Defendant had a statutory and regulatory duty to provide and maintain adequate hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment in accordance with 105 C.M.R. 410.190–410.200 and G.L. c. 111, § 127A et seq.

47. The complete loss of hot water in a residential apartment for approximately three weeks is a serious and substantial interference with the ordinary, expected, and lawful use of the Premises for living, bathing, cleaning, and maintaining basic hygiene.

48. Defendant received prompt and repeated notice from Plaintiff of the lack of hot water, starting on the day the Hot Water Outage began and continuing throughout the three-week period.

49. Notwithstanding this notice, Defendant failed to restore hot water to the Premises within a reasonable time and failed to provide alternative accommodations, temporary arrangements, or rent reduction to mitigate the interference.

50. Under settled Massachusetts law, a landlord’s “good intentions” or explanations (such as a backordered part) do not excuse a breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s acts or omissions result in a substantial interference with the tenant’s tenancy. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord liable where his conduct “set in motion the forces” that interfered with quiet enjoyment, regardless of specific intent); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03 (focus is on effect on tenant, not subjective intent).

51. Defendant’s failure to timely repair or replace the water heater, or otherwise restore hot water, after notice of the defect constitutes a direct and indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

52. The lack of hot water for this extended period also constitutes an ongoing sanitary code violation that materially affects habitability, further supporting a finding of substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. at 200–04; *McKenna v. Begin*, 5 Mass. App. Ct. at 308–09.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

    a. Loss of the use and enjoyment of a habitable apartment with adequate hot water;  
    b. Out-of-pocket costs for a gym membership used for access to hot showers;  
    c. Increased transportation expenses to travel to the gym and to Plaintiff’s mother’s house for bathing Plaintiff’s baby;  
    d. Inconvenience, disruption of daily life, and emotional distress associated with maintaining basic hygiene and caring for a baby without hot water; and  
    e. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises during the period of the Hot Water Outage.

54. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any are incurred).

55. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200. Three months’ rent is therefore $3,600.

56. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, which she reasonably estimates at no less than Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) exclusive of statutory enhancements, are less than three months’ rent.

57. Accordingly, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover a minimum statutory award of three months’ rent, or $3,600, plus costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees if Plaintiff retains counsel, because three months’ rent exceeds her actual damages. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 789–90 (three months’ rent is minimum recovery under § 14).

58. Plaintiff also reserves the right to seek any additional relief consistent with G.L. c. 93A if applicable, though no separate count is asserted herein.
