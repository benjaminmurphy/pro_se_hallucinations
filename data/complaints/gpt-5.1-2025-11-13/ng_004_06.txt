COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT  
CIVIL ACTION – TRIAL COURT  

------------------------------------------------------  
JACOB MILLER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Civil Action No. ___________  

EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Jacob Miller (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Emily Johnson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jacob Miller is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present at the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts (“the Premises”).

2. Defendant Emily Johnson is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and at all relevant times was the owner, landlord, and person in control of the three‑unit residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

3. This action sounds in negligence and seeks monetary damages for personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff as a result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk appurtenant to the Premises in a reasonably safe condition during winter weather.

4. The Worcester District Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 21, because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court and because this is a civil action in tort seeking money damages.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 218, § 19, because the cause of action arose in Worcester County and the Premises where the incident occurred is located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Defendant owns, manages, and/or controls a three‑unit residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant had the right and responsibility to control, maintain, and repair the exterior common areas of the Premises, including the sidewalk and the pedestrian path used by tenants, guests, invitees, and delivery persons.

8. On or about February 7–9, 2023, a winter snowstorm affected Worcester, Massachusetts, resulting in significant snowfall and accumulation of snow and ice on and around the Premises, including on the sidewalk in front of and providing access to the building at 123 Maple Street.

9. Following the snowstorm, Defendant undertook snow‑removal efforts on the sidewalk at the Premises.

10. Rather than adequately clearing and treating the sidewalk, Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk.

11. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or any other de‑icing or traction materials to the shoveled path or to the remainder of the sidewalk.

12. Over the next several days following the storm, changing daytime and nighttime temperatures caused the remaining snow and ice to melt during the day and refreeze at night.

13. As a result of this melt‑and‑refreeze cycle, the narrow shoveled path along the sidewalk turned into a sheet of smooth, hard ice, which created an unreasonably dangerous and slippery walking surface (the “ice condition”).

14. The ice condition was open and obvious to Defendant or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have been known to Defendant given the weather, the time elapsed since the storm, and the visible condition of the sidewalk.

15. Tenants residing at the Premises observed and experienced the hazardous ice condition on the sidewalk.

16. The tenants, concerned for their own safety and the safety of visitors, contacted Defendant by text message and notified Defendant of the icy and dangerous condition on the sidewalk.

17. The tenants also sent photographs of the ice condition to Defendant, showing the hazardous sheet of ice on the narrow shoveled path.

18. Upon receiving actual notice of the condition, Defendant responded, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” indicating that she would not take further action to treat or remedy the ice condition.

19. Defendant did not subsequently apply salt, sand, or other de‑icing material to the sidewalk, nor did she remove the ice, block access, or warn tenants, visitors, or delivery persons of the danger.

20. On February 10, 2023, at approximately mid‑day, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises delivering groceries to one of the tenants of 123 Maple Street.

21. Plaintiff was a lawful visitor and invitee, present at the Premises for the mutual benefit of the tenant and Defendant, and using the sidewalk in the manner intended for pedestrian ingress and egress.

22. To reach the entrance of the building, Plaintiff walked up the sidewalk along the narrow path that had been shoveled by Defendant.

23. The sidewalk and shoveled path were covered in ice created by the melt‑and‑refreeze cycle, rendering the surface extremely slippery and dangerous.

24. As Plaintiff proceeded along the sidewalk in the exercise of reasonable care and caution, his feet suddenly slipped out from under him on the ice.

25. Plaintiff lost his balance and fell backwards violently, striking his lower back and body on the hard, icy surface of the sidewalk.

26. Plaintiff immediately experienced severe pain in his lower back and had difficulty standing and walking following the fall.

27. The fall and resulting injuries to Plaintiff were caused by the hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk, which in turn was caused and/or allowed to persist by Defendant’s failure to properly treat, sand, salt, or otherwise maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors such as Plaintiff.

28. After the incident, tenants at the Premises informed Plaintiff that they had previously notified Defendant about the icy condition, including sending her photographs, and that Defendant had refused to take further action, stating that “the sun will take care of it.”

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries to his lower back and associated bodily structures.

30. Plaintiff sought and received medical treatment for his lower back injury, including but not limited to evaluation, diagnostic testing, and conservative care.

31. Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical expenses to date are approximately $2,500.

32. As a further direct and proximate result of his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week, causing him to lose approximately $1,000 in wages.

33. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, and limitations associated with his lower back injury.

34. Plaintiff has experienced physical pain, emotional distress, inconvenience, lost enjoyment of life, and impairment in his ordinary daily activities as a result of the fall.

35. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to address the known icy condition on the sidewalk, despite actual notice and ample time to act after the snowstorm, constitutes a breach of her duty of reasonable care toward lawful visitors, including Plaintiff.

---

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

36. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 35 above as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

37. At all relevant times, Defendant, as the owner and person in control of the Premises at 123 Maple Street, owed a duty to lawful visitors, including Plaintiff, to exercise reasonable care to keep the property and its common areas, including the sidewalk and access path, in a reasonably safe condition, and to protect lawful visitors against reasonably foreseeable risks of harm.  

   See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995) (landowner has duty to maintain premises in reasonably safe condition and protect lawful visitors against foreseeable risks of harm).

38. Defendant’s duty of reasonable care included, but was not limited to:  

   a. Reasonably inspecting the Premises and its walkways, including the sidewalk, particularly following winter storms;  
   b. Removing or treating snow and ice accumulations within a reasonable time after a storm;  
   c. Applying sand, salt, or other de‑icing materials as necessary to reduce the risk of slipping;  
   d. Remedying or mitigating hazardous conditions created or aggravated by melt‑and‑refreeze cycles after a storm; and  
   e. Warning lawful visitors of known dangerous conditions that Defendant could not or did not promptly remedy.

39. Massachusetts law imposes a duty on property owners and persons in control of property to act with reasonable care regarding snow and ice conditions, and to treat snow and ice like any other dangerous condition on the property.  

   See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378–83 (2010) (abolishing the natural‑accumulation rule and holding that property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors as to all hazards arising from snow and ice, natural or unnatural); *Normandin v. Town of Belchertown*, 468 Mass. 417, 422–24 (2014).

40. Defendant’s duty of reasonable care toward Plaintiff and other lawful visitors is consistent with the general negligence principles in Massachusetts.  

   See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages; duty arises where harm is reasonably foreseeable); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (landowner has duty to maintain property in reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors).

**Breach**

41. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care by failing to maintain the sidewalk at the Premises in a reasonably safe condition during and after the February 2023 snowstorm.

42. Defendant specifically breached her duty of care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Shoveling only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk, thereby creating or exacerbating a narrow area of travel subject to melt‑and‑refreeze;  
   b. Failing to apply salt, sand, or other de‑icing or traction materials to the sidewalk and narrow path after shoveling;  
   c. Failing to reasonably monitor the condition of the sidewalk and narrow path in the days following the storm;  
   d. Failing to remedy or mitigate the obvious icy condition that developed along the narrow path due to the melt‑and‑refreeze cycle;  
   e. Ignoring and disregarding complaints and photographic evidence from tenants that put Defendant on actual notice of the dangerous ice condition;  
   f. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other lawful visitors of the hazardous icy condition; and  
   g. Choosing to rely on “the sun” to address the known hazard instead of taking timely and reasonable steps to make the sidewalk safe.

43. Defendant’s failure to act after receiving actual notice from tenants that the sidewalk had become dangerously icy constitutes a clear breach of her duty of reasonable care.  

   See *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 168–69 (1980) (landlord owes duty of reasonable care as to common areas under his control); *Lyon v. Morphew*, 424 Mass. 828, 831–32 (1997) (duty extends to conditions of which the landlord knows or should know).

44. The hazardous ice condition on the sidewalk was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant in light of the winter storm, the melt‑and‑refreeze pattern, the shoveling of a narrow path, and the tenants’ complaints and photographs.  

   See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147 (foreseeability of harm is key to determining scope of duty and breach).

45. By failing to take reasonable steps to remove, treat, or warn about the ice condition after receiving actual notice and having ample time to act, Defendant acted unreasonably and fell below the standard of care required of a reasonable property owner in like circumstances.  

   See *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 384–85 (standard is what reasonable person would do in managing property under the circumstances).

46. Defendant’s conduct and omissions constituted negligence under Massachusetts common law and under the general negligence principles reflected in G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence framework).

**Causation**

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition and failure to address the known icy condition, Plaintiff slipped, fell, and was injured on February 10, 2023.

48. But for Defendant’s negligence in failing to properly treat, sand, salt, or otherwise remedy the ice condition, Plaintiff would not have slipped and fallen on the sidewalk at the Premises.

49. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—slip‑and‑fall injuries to his back caused by a dangerous ice condition on a walkway—is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk.  

   See *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 378–80; *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. at 744–45.

50. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff’s fall and injuries.

**Damages**

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a lower back injury and related bodily injuries.

52. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500 for evaluation, treatment, and care related to his injuries.

53. Plaintiff lost approximately one week of wages, totaling approximately $1,000, as a direct consequence of being unable to work due to his injuries.

54. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience pain and suffering, including physical pain, soreness, stiffness, and limitations in movement associated with his lower back injury.

55. Plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, anxiety, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life due to the limitations and pain caused by the fall.

56. Plaintiff has suffered, and may in the future suffer, impairment and loss of earning capacity to the extent his injuries affect his ability to perform work or other activities.

57. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages are the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition and failing to take reasonable steps to address the known icy hazard.

58. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages proximately caused by her negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other consequential damages.  

   See *Alvarez v. Seadside, Inc.*, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 297–98 (2012) (damages in negligence include medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering); *Jones v. Boykan*, 464 Mass. 285, 294–95 (2013).

59. To the extent, if any, that comparative negligence is asserted as a defense, Plaintiff states that he at all times exercised reasonable care for his own safety and that any alleged contributory negligence on his part, which is denied, was less than the negligence of Defendant. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover damages reduced, if at all, only in accordance with G.L. c. 231, § 85.

---

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW (STATUTES AND CASES)

60. Plaintiff’s negligence claim is governed by Massachusetts common law and the following statutes, among others:

   a. G.L. c. 231, § 85 – Comparative negligence statute, providing that a plaintiff’s negligence shall not bar recovery if it is not greater than the total negligence of the defendant(s);  
   b. G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 21 – Granting the District Court jurisdiction over civil actions for money damages within the Court’s jurisdictional limit;  
   c. G.L. c. 223, § 2 – Governing venue in civil actions;  
   d. Principles of premises liability as articulated in Massachusetts case law including:  
      - *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) – Establishing a unified duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors;  
      - *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980) – Landlord’s duty to exercise reasonable care regarding common areas;  
      - *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) – Abolishing the natural/unnatural accumulation distinction and imposing a duty of reasonable care regarding snow and ice;  
      - *Normandin v. Town of Belchertown*, 468 Mass. 417 (2014) – Applying *Papadopoulos* and discussing reasonable care in municipal snow and ice cases;  
      - *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) – Landowner’s duty to protect lawful visitors from foreseeable risks;  
      - *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000) – Duty of care owed by landowners to lawful visitors;  
      - *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) – Defining duty, breach, causation, and foreseeability in negligence;  
      - *Lyon v. Morphew*, 424 Mass. 828 (1997) – Landlord’s liability for failing to remedy known dangerous conditions;  
      - *Alvarez v. Seadside, Inc.*, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 294 (2012) – Elements of premises liability and recoverable damages;  
      - *Jones v. Boykan*, 464 Mass. 285 (2013) – Scope of tort damages, including pain and suffering.

61. Under these authorities, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk at 123 Maple Street in a reasonably safe condition, including by taking reasonable steps to address snow and ice hazards after a storm. Defendant breached that duty, and her breach caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
