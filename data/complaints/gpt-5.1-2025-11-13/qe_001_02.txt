    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Thompson”) states the following Complaint against Defendant Jordan Smith (“Defendant” or “Mr. Smith”):


                                   I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson is an individual residing at 12 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

2. Defendant Jordan Smith is, upon information and belief, an individual who owns, controls, manages, and/or operates the residential rental premises located at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”). Defendant is a “landlord” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.


                         II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The amount in controversy is approximately Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, which is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

5. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A, the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, has jurisdiction over this matter.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises is located in Dorchester, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division.


                             III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) to Defendant at all relevant times.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for providing heat to the Premises in compliance with Massachusetts law and applicable housing codes.

10. Pursuant to the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., and particularly 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and 410.200, a landlord must provide heating facilities capable of maintaining every habitable room at a temperature of at least 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., and 64°F between 11:01 p.m. and 6:59 a.m., during the heating season.

11. During the winter of 2024–2025, and specifically throughout the months of December 2024, January 2025, and February 2025, Plaintiff’s heat repeatedly and consistently failed to maintain a habitable temperature.

12. On numerous evenings during that winter, the indoor temperature in the Apartment fell to approximately 60°F for several hours at a time.

13. These temperature drops typically occurred during the evening hours when Plaintiff was home and needed heat most.

14. The temperature in Plaintiff’s Apartment during those periods was below the minimum temperatures required by the State Sanitary Code and constituted a violation of 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and 410.200.

15. Plaintiff notified Defendant that the Apartment was excessively cold and that the heat was not functioning properly.

16. In response, Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on one occasion during the winter.

17. After that first repair visit, the heating system worked adequately for approximately one week, but then the intermittent failures and cold conditions recurred.

18. Plaintiff again notified Defendant that the heat was not working properly and that the temperature continued to fall to around 60°F for hours at a time.

19. Defendant sent a second repair person, who inspected the boiler and informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and that there was not much more that could be done.

20. Despite these repair attempts, the heating system continued to malfunction in substantially the same way, with the temperature repeatedly dropping to approximately 60°F for hours at a time.

21. Defendant failed to correct the underlying heating problem or to provide an alternative adequate source of heat to maintain the Apartment in compliance with the State Sanitary Code.

22. Defendant took the position that the heat was “working” because it never went completely off and the building was not “freezing,” despite the repeated Code‑violating temperatures inside Plaintiff’s Apartment.

23. As a result of the inadequate heat, Plaintiff had to purchase two portable space heaters in order to keep the Apartment at a minimally livable temperature.

24. The use of those space heaters significantly increased Plaintiff’s electric bill by approximately One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per month during the affected winter months.

25. Plaintiff incurred out‑of‑pocket expenses for the purchase and operation of the space heaters that she would not have incurred if Defendant had provided adequate heat as required by law.

26. During this same winter period, Plaintiff developed bronchitis in or about January 2025.

27. Plaintiff’s health‑care provider advised that the cold indoor air in Plaintiff’s Apartment likely contributed to or exacerbated Plaintiff’s bronchitis.

28. Plaintiff was prescribed antibiotics and incurred medical expenses in connection with diagnosis and treatment of the bronchitis.

29. Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work due to illness associated with the cold conditions and bronchitis and thereby suffered lost wages.

30. The inadequate heat and cold conditions caused Plaintiff significant physical discomfort, emotional distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

31. Plaintiff was forced to spend her evenings wearing multiple layers of clothing, using blankets constantly, and confining herself to the rooms near the space heaters to remain warm.

32. The cold conditions interfered with Plaintiff’s normal daily living activities, including sleeping, working from home when necessary, and hosting family or friends.

33. At all relevant times, Plaintiff acted reasonably and made good‑faith efforts to notify Defendant of the inadequate heat and to allow reasonable access for repairs.

34. Notwithstanding such notice and opportunities to cure, Defendant failed and refused to provide a heating system capable of maintaining temperatures in compliance with 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and the implied warranty of habitability.

35. Defendant’s acts and omissions resulted in conditions that materially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

36. Defendant’s response to Plaintiff’s complaints was inadequate, unreasonable, and in disregard of Defendant’s statutory and common‑law duties to provide habitable premises and to refrain from interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

37. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: increased utility costs, medical expenses, lost wages, and loss of the value and enjoyment of her tenancy.

38. Based on these harms and the diminished value of the Apartment during the periods of inadequate heat, Plaintiff reasonably estimates her damages to be at least Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), exclusive of statutory multipliers, interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, if any.


                     IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
   BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT – G.L. c. 186, § 14

39. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 38 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

40. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes a covenant that the landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the premises by the occupant.”

41. A landlord’s failure to maintain essential services, such as heat, in accordance with applicable law and code requirements can constitute a direct or indirect interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment, giving rise to liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

42. The State Sanitary Code and related regulations, including 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and 410.200, require landlords to provide heating facilities capable of maintaining specified minimum indoor temperatures during the heating season. A violation of these health and safety regulations may constitute an interference with quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

43. Defendant, as landlord and person in control of the Premises, had a non‑delegable duty to maintain the heating system in a condition sufficient to keep the Apartment at lawful temperatures. See McAllister v. Boston Hous. Auth., 429 Mass. 300 (1999); Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

44. Despite notice from Plaintiff that the heat was inadequate and that the Apartment was repeatedly dropping to approximately 60°F—below the Code‑required levels—Defendant failed to correct the problem and allowed the substandard conditions to persist for an extended period of time through the winter.

45. Defendant’s failure to provide heat in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, after receiving notice and having a reasonable opportunity to cure, constitutes at least a negligent and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where conduct or omissions, even if not intentional, foreseeably result in substantial interference); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

46. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may be liable under the covenant of quiet enjoyment even where there have been some attempts at repair, if the landlord’s overall response is inadequate and the harmful condition continues. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

47. The lack of adequate heat in Plaintiff’s Apartment materially impaired the character and value of the tenancy and rendered the Premises unfit or unsafe for human habitation during the periods of violation. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (implied warranty of habitability and interaction with quiet enjoyment).

48. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was “substantial” within the meaning of Massachusetts law, because Plaintiff was forced to endure sustained Code‑deficient temperatures, incurred additional expenses for heat, suffered illness made worse by the cold conditions, and lost the ability to use and enjoy her Apartment in a normal manner. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994).

49. The foregoing conduct by Defendant constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

50. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

51. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500.00; three months’ rent therefore equals $4,500.00. Plaintiff presently seeks a more modest amount of actual damages, estimated at Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), but reserves all rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14 to the extent applicable.

52. Plaintiff’s damages include, but are not limited to:  
    a. Increased electric costs of approximately $150.00 per month during the winter months in which the heating system failed to maintain lawful temperatures;  
    b. Out‑of‑pocket costs for the purchase of space heaters;  
    c. Medical expenses associated with treatment of bronchitis likely exacerbated by the cold indoor environment;  
    d. Lost wages resulting from missed work due to illness; and  
    e. Loss of use and enjoyment and diminution in the rental value of the Apartment during the periods of inadequate heat.

53. Plaintiff is also entitled to statutory interest on any judgment under G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

54. To the extent applicable, any unfair or deceptive acts or practices related to Defendant’s failure to provide habitable housing and to comply with G.L. c. 186, § 14 may also constitute violations of G.L. c. 93A, §§ 2 and 9, although Plaintiff’s present claim is brought solely under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

55. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages.


                             V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Jordan Smith, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of actual and consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial, presently estimated at no less than Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), together with such additional amounts as are warranted under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including, if applicable, three months’ rent;

C. An award of statutory interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

D. An award of costs of this action, and, if and to the extent available under G.L. c. 186, § 14 or other applicable law, reasonable attorney’s fees (if counsel later appears);

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.


                                   VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
