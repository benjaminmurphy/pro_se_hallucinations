      "support_reasoning": "The SJC explains that under G.L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, a judge may not only commit children to the Department but also must provide guidance regarding placement and visitation, and it emphasizes that the department\u2019s otherwise broad discretion over visitation and placement is subject to court direction. The court specifically states that, in a care and protection case like this where family relationships and visitation have been significant, the judge must include directions about continued visitation or make findings justifying limiting it. This necessarily recognizes judicial authority to shape and condition contact/parenting time to protect the children\u2019s best interests and ensure appropriate care.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Although a simple commitment order is all that is required by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, and the applicable regulation of the department\u2026in this case, the judge should have given the department some guidance regarding the ultimate placement of the children and visitation by family members\u2026When the department is granted permanent custody of a child, it has virtually free rein\u2026Even if the separation of Mary from her sisters and grandparents is ultimately found to be in her best interests, some direction from the judge regarding continued visitation is required\u2026[T]he judge must include in his order some direction to the department that visitation shall continue or make findings that support his conclusion if he believes it should not."
