    Defendant.  
____________________________________/  

### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Jessica Martinez (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Greenway Grocery Store (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martinez is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and business invitee at Defendant’s grocery store located in Somerville, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Greenway Grocery Store is a business entity (whether corporation, LLC, or other form) authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, operating a retail grocery store located at 123 Main Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, operated, managed, maintained, and/or was otherwise responsible for the Premises, including the interior aisles and dairy section where Plaintiff was injured.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising from Defendant’s negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional threshold of this Court and is within the jurisdictional limits of the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A.

6. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 223A, § 3 because the cause of action arose in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business, and the incident occurred, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 30, 2023, at approximately Saturday afternoon hours, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a paying customer and business invitee, shopping in the dairy aisle of Defendant’s store at 123 Main Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

8. As a business invitee, Plaintiff was owed a duty of reasonable care by Defendant to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition, to inspect for and remedy dangerous conditions, and to warn of hazards that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about.  
   See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowner owes lawful visitor duty of reasonable care); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371–73 (2010).

9. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a visible puddle of spilled milk on the floor and slipped, falling hard onto her hip.

10. The puddle was not a small or isolated spill, but a noticeable accumulation of liquid, with visible shopping cart tracks running through it, indicating that other customers had already passed through the spill and that it had been present for a period of time.

11. There were no warning signs, wet floor cones, barricades, or any other warnings alerting customers to the presence of the spill or any dangerous condition in the dairy aisle.

12. Immediately before Plaintiff’s fall, an employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the puddle in the same dairy aisle.

13. After Plaintiff fell, the same employee came over to Plaintiff and stated that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing stocking shelves before going to get a mop.

14. Defendant’s employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee acting within the scope of his employment, had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition before Plaintiff’s fall and unreasonably delayed taking any steps to clean, remedy, or warn customers about the spill.

15. At all relevant times, Defendant’s employees were acting within the course and scope of their employment, and Defendant is responsible for their acts and omissions under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See *Wang Labs., Inc. v. Bus. Incentives, Inc.*, 398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986) (vicarious liability for employees acting within scope of employment).

16. Defendant failed to inspect, maintain, and clean the aisle within a reasonable time and failed to follow reasonable and customary safety procedures to prevent or remedy spills in the dairy section, despite the foreseeable risk that liquids might be spilled and create slipping hazards.

17. Defendant also failed to promptly act upon the actual notice it had of the spill through its employee, who knowingly allowed the hazard to remain on the floor for “a few minutes” without cleaning it up or placing any warning sign or cone.

18. As a direct and proximate result of stepping into the puddle of milk and slipping, Plaintiff fell forcefully onto her hip and immediately experienced pain and discomfort.

19. Believing at the time that her injuries were not severe, Plaintiff completed her shopping and left the store. That evening, however, Plaintiff’s hip pain significantly worsened.

20. On or about October 1, 2023, the day after the fall, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain and related soft-tissue injury.

21. Plaintiff thereafter underwent a course of medical treatment, including physical therapy, to address her hip sprain and resulting pain, stiffness, and limitation of movement.

22. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses, including charges for urgent care, diagnostic evaluation, and physical therapy.

23. Plaintiff is employed at a café and, due to her injuries and pain, she was unable to work several scheduled shifts while recovering, resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.

24. In addition to her medical expenses and lost wages, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of normal activities of daily living as a direct and foreseeable consequence of the fall and resulting injuries.

25. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and failure to timely remedy or warn of the spill in the dairy aisle.

---

## IV. NEGLIGENCE (ONLY CAUSE OF ACTION)

26. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–25 as if fully set forth herein.

27. Under Massachusetts common law, a property owner or occupier owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to the condition of the property. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 153–54 (2013).

28. This duty applies to business proprietors such as grocery stores, who must maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, remedy hazards within a reasonable time after they arise, and warn customers of dangers of which they know or reasonably should know. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371–73 (2010); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–85 (2007).

29. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty of reasonable care in the ownership, operation, management, inspection, and maintenance of the Premises, including the dairy aisle where the spill occurred. See *DeCosta v. Cammack*, 330 Mass. 177, 180 (1953) (storekeeper must use ordinary care to keep premises reasonably safe); *Trimble v. Methodist Hosp.*, 436 Mass. 102, 106–07 (2002) (duty of care includes reasonable inspections).

30. Pursuant to the principles set forth in *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780 (2007), Defendant is liable where it knew or reasonably should have known of a foreign substance on the floor and failed to exercise reasonable care to protect its customers from the resulting risk of harm.

31. In Massachusetts, negligence is established where there exists (1) a duty of reasonable care, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) damages. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio, Inc.*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

32. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to maintain the floors of the dairy aisle in a reasonably safe condition;  
   b. Failing to adopt and/or follow reasonable inspection and cleaning procedures to identify and remedy spills in a timely fashion;  
   c. Failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk after its employee became aware of the spill;  
   d. Failing to immediately place warning signs, cones, or other barriers around the spill once the employee knew of its existence;  
   e. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other customers of the known dangerous condition;  
   f. Allowing a dangerous, slippery condition to persist for several minutes after actual notice, despite the presence of an employee nearby;  
   g. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees regarding prompt response to spills and floor hazards; and  
   h. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent grocery store operator would under the same or similar circumstances.

33. Defendant, through its employee, had actual notice of the spill before Plaintiff’s fall, as evidenced by the employee’s admission that he had seen the spill “a few minutes ago” yet chose to continue stocking shelves instead of remedying or warning of the hazard.

34. Even if Defendant lacked actual knowledge at some earlier time, the size of the puddle and the presence of cart tracks through it demonstrate that the condition existed long enough that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it, thereby providing at least constructive notice. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 166–67 (1973) (premises liability where condition existed long enough that reasonable care would have discovered it).

35. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of reasonable care required of a business proprietor and constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146; *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 61 (1983) (duty measured by what a reasonable person would do in the circumstances).

36. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip and fall and the injuries she sustained. See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (causation requires that negligence be substantial contributing factor).

37. As a further result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered foreseeable personal injuries and economic damages, consistent with the principles of compensatory damages articulated in, inter alia, *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 549–50 (1982) (damages include medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering); see also G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest on personal injury damages).

38. Plaintiff’s damages include, but are not limited to:

   a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200 for urgent care and physical therapy;  
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $800 resulting from missed work shifts at her café job;  
   c. Pain and suffering, including physical pain in her hip, discomfort, and limitation of movement;  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal daily activities; and  
   e. Any other general and special damages proven at trial.

39. Plaintiff’s own conduct did not cause or contribute to the dangerous condition created and allowed to persist by Defendant. To the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff denies such allegations and asserts that any such negligence, if found, would be substantially outweighed by Defendant’s negligence and, in any event, would not bar recovery but would only proportionally reduce damages under G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence).

40. Under the principles codified in G.L. c. 231, § 6B and related case law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages, together with prejudgment interest, costs, and such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
