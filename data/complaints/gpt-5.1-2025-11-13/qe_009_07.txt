COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Alicia Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Jensen (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Alicia Thompson is an adult individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.

2. Defendant Mark Jensen is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (“the Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Massachusetts Housing Court, Western Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, which grants the Housing Court jurisdiction over actions arising out of the occupation of residential premises and the landlord–tenant relationship.

4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 8, and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because the Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, which lies within the territorial jurisdiction of the Housing Court, Western Division.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement (written or oral) with Defendant for a residential apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.

6. The apartment is a two-bedroom residential unit (the “Apartment”) intended for use as a dwelling, and was so used by Plaintiff at all relevant times.

7. Plaintiff has, at all times relevant, paid rent of $1,200.00 per month to Defendant for the Apartment.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord and owner of the Premises, was responsible for maintaining the Apartment and its appurtenances, including electrical systems, in a condition fit for human habitation, free from defects that materially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

9. One of the two bedrooms in the Apartment (the “Office Bedroom”) has had no electricity for approximately six weeks prior to the date of this Complaint.

10. The electrical problem is specific to the Office Bedroom: the electrical outlets in that room do not function and the overhead light does not operate.

11. The remainder of the Apartment’s electrical service functions, but the Office Bedroom is not usable as a bedroom or as a workspace due to the lack of electricity.

12. Prior to the electrical failure, Plaintiff used the Office Bedroom as a home office for her work.

13. Once the electrical system in the Office Bedroom failed, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem.  

14. Defendant sent an electrician to the Apartment. The electrician advised that the electrical problem in the Office Bedroom would require a more substantial repair to fix properly, due in part to the building’s older wiring.

15. Defendant has acknowledged to Plaintiff that the repair is necessary and that the building’s old wiring makes the repair more complicated.

16. Defendant has told Plaintiff that he is “getting quotes” for the needed work and that the situation is “complicated” because of the building’s old wiring, but, as of the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), Defendant has failed to complete the repairs and restore electricity to the Office Bedroom.

17. The lack of electricity in the Office Bedroom has persisted continuously for approximately six weeks.

18. During this period, Plaintiff has been completely unable to use the Office Bedroom as a bedroom or as a functional office space.

19. As a direct result of the loss of electricity in the Office Bedroom, Plaintiff has had to relocate her work activities outside the Apartment, including working from coffee shops and other public spaces.

20. In order to have a usable workspace with electricity and internet, Plaintiff has been forced to purchase coffee and food at coffee shops, at an average cost of approximately $15 per day while working there.

21. In addition, Plaintiff has obtained and paid for a coworking space membership at a cost of approximately $150 per month in order to have reliable access to a workspace and electricity.

22. Plaintiff’s office furniture, computer equipment, and other work-related materials that were previously located in the Office Bedroom have been moved into the Apartment’s living room, substantially cluttering and limiting the living room’s use and making the Apartment generally less comfortable and less functional.

23. The loss of a functional bedroom and office space, combined with the need to work off-site and the resulting clutter in the living room, has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment as her home.

24. The Office Bedroom is one of only two bedrooms in the Apartment. The loss of electrical service in that room has reduced the Apartment’s usable area and eliminated Plaintiff’s ability to use one of its principal rooms for its intended purposes.

25. The persistent lack of electricity in the Office Bedroom constitutes a serious defect affecting a facility and service required for the habitation and ordinarily supplied by a landlord, and therefore renders the Apartment, in relevant part, unfit for the use reasonably to be expected of such premises.

26. Defendant has had ample notice and opportunity to correct the defect, but has failed and refused to make timely repairs.

27. Defendant’s failure to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom is without justification and is not due to any fault or negligence of Plaintiff.

28. Plaintiff has remained current on rent obligations during this period, despite the loss of the use of the Office Bedroom.

29. Plaintiff estimates that, as a result of the loss of electricity in the Office Bedroom and the corresponding loss of use of that room and interference with her use of the Apartment, she has suffered damages of approximately $900.00, consisting of:  
   a. Out-of-pocket expenses for working in coffee shops (approximately $15 per day for multiple weeks);  
   b. Monthly coworking space membership costs of approximately $150 per month; and  
   c. Diminution in the rental value and use of the Apartment due to the loss of a functional bedroom and office space and the resulting disruption to her living conditions.

30. Plaintiff further alleges that the conditions described above—specifically, the persistent lack of electrical service in one bedroom and Defendant’s failure to remedy the defect after notice—constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the tenancy under Massachusetts law.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

31. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in pertinent part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

33. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when the landlord, or someone acting under his control, commits acts or omissions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises. *See, e.g.*, **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

34. A landlord’s failure, after notice, to repair serious defects in facilities and services he is obligated to provide can constitute an “indirect interference” with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–48 (2005).

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when conditions at the premises, caused or allowed to persist by the landlord, materially impair the character and value of the leased premises. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982) (repeated flooding and landlord’s failure to alleviate conditions breached quiet enjoyment); **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

36. Massachusetts law recognizes that the implied warranty of habitability requires that a residential unit comply with the State Sanitary Code and be fit for human habitation, and that serious code violations or failures in essential services can also support claims for breach of quiet enjoyment. *See* **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973); **Hemingway** citing G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A, 127H and 105 C.M.R. 410.000 (State Sanitary Code).

37. The State Sanitary Code requires, among other things, that every dwelling unit be provided with sufficient electrical outlets and lighting and that electrical service be maintained in good working order. *See* 105 C.M.R. 410.254, 410.351–410.355.

38. G.L. c. 239, § 8A, and cases interpreting it, further recognize that substantial defects in essential services (including heat, water, and electricity) can constitute serious code violations and materially affect the health, safety, or well-being of tenants, warranting rent abatement or other relief. *See, e.g.*, **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979).

39. Here, Defendant is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the Apartment’s electrical system, including the electricity to the Office Bedroom.

40. Defendant had actual notice of the loss of electrical service to the Office Bedroom, as evidenced by Plaintiff’s complaints and Defendant’s having sent an electrician to inspect the room.

41. Despite such notice and the clear necessity of repairs, Defendant failed to remedy the electrical defect for approximately six weeks (and counting) as of the date of this Complaint, thereby allowing the condition to persist.

42. The loss of electrical service in the Office Bedroom deprived Plaintiff of the use of one of only two bedrooms in the Apartment, and prevented Plaintiff from using that room as a home office, which was an important and intended use of the space at the time of renting.

43. Because the Office Bedroom was rendered effectively unusable for sleeping, working, or other normal residential purposes, Plaintiff’s beneficial use and enjoyment of a substantial part of the Apartment was materially and substantially impaired.

44. Defendant’s failure to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom constitutes an “interference, by any means, with the quiet enjoyment” of the Apartment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. *See* **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord’s acts or omissions that foreseeably lead to substantial interference can violate § 14).

45. Defendant’s interference was at least negligent, if not willful, because:  
   a. Defendant knew of the serious electrical defect;  
   b. Defendant was advised that a substantial repair was needed; and  
   c. Despite this knowledge, Defendant failed to take reasonably prompt steps to complete the repair and restore electrical service to the Office Bedroom.

46. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 even where the interference with quiet enjoyment is the result of negligence rather than intentional conduct, so long as the landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. *See* **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 102–04; **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. at 850–51; **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. at 747–48.

47. The conditions created and allowed to persist by Defendant also constitute violations of the implied warranty of habitability as recognized in **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. at 199–201, and constitute substantial impairments of services required under the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000, which further evidences and supports Plaintiff’s claim that her quiet enjoyment has been breached.

48. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Loss of the use of one bedroom (the Office Bedroom);  
   b. Disruption and interference with her ability to work from home;  
   c. Out-of-pocket expenses for coffee shop use at approximately $15 per day for an extended period;  
   d. Payment for a coworking space membership of approximately $150 per month; and  
   e. Diminution in the rental value and enjoyment of the Apartment for the period during which the electrical service in the Office Bedroom has been unavailable.

49. Plaintiff estimates that her total damages resulting from the interference with her quiet enjoyment are at least $900.00, and she reserves the right to present evidence of additional or more precise damages at trial.

50. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is presently self-represented, she seeks all relief and statutory remedies available under the statute, including three months’ rent if that amount exceeds her actual damages.

51. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00; three months’ rent totals $3,600.00. To the extent required and appropriate under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law, Plaintiff seeks an award of three months’ rent ($3,600.00) as statutory damages in addition to, or in the alternative to, actual damages, as the statute and the Court permit. *See* **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman**, 417 Mass. 771, 775–77 (1994) (discussing statutory damages under § 14).
