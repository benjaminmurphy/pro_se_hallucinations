COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME / LEGAL CUSTODY – SCHOOL‑RELATED DECISION-MAKING)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting-time judgment with respect to the minor child, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee, is an individual who resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emily Smith (d.o.b. __________, age 10).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in or around Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Emily Smith.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, Emily Smith (hereafter “Emily” or “the child”).

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND JURISDICTION

4. On or about May 15, 2022, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment (the “Judgment”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the parties’ minor child, Emily Smith.

5. Under the existing Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody of Emily, with the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee, designated as the primary residential parent.

6. Under the existing Judgment, the Defendant, Michael Smith, has substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights that extend through Sunday night into Monday morning (“Sunday-night overnights”).

7. The Judgment requires that the parties cooperate on school-related matters and keep each other reasonably informed regarding the child’s education and related issues.

8. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody, visitation, and support of the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, and related provisions, and under the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G.L. c. 209B, because Massachusetts is and has been Emily’s home state and the state that entered the existing Judgment.

9. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3, and applicable laws governing domestic relations cases.

### III. STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

10. A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody and parenting-time judgment when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

11. In making or modifying custody orders, the “best interests of the child” standard governs. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

12. Education and school attendance are central components of a child’s welfare and best interests, and a parent’s interference with schooling and educational progress may warrant modification of existing custody and parenting-time orders. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (recognizing significance of stability and appropriate parental decision-making for a child’s development); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

13. At the time of the May 15, 2022 Judgment, Emily was regularly attending school, was not facing truancy issues, and was performing satisfactorily in her schoolwork, grades, and standardized testing.

14. Since approximately the past year, and particularly over the most recent school year, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances concerning Emily’s school attendance and academic performance during and following Father’s parenting time.

15. Specifically, during Father’s weekends and Sunday-night overnights, Father has routinely kept Emily home from school on Mondays following those weekends, stating to Mother and/or to the child that Emily “needs a mental health day.”

16. These absences on Mondays are not supported by medical documentation or professional recommendation; there are no doctor’s notes or other clinician letters justifying these repeated absences.

17. As a direct and foreseeable result of these repeated Monday absences, Emily’s school has issued truancy warnings and has notified Mother (and, upon information and belief, Father) that Emily’s attendance record is unacceptable and jeopardizing her academic progress.

18. Over this same period, Emily’s grades and test scores have declined noticeably from the level they were at the time of the May 15, 2022 Judgment, as reported by the school and observed by Mother.

19. In addition, Emily has been scheduled for tutoring and academic support sessions designed to help her maintain and improve her academic performance. Many of these sessions are scheduled to occur during Father’s parenting time on weekends.

20. Father has regularly refused or failed to bring Emily to these scheduled tutoring sessions when they occur during his weekends, despite having notice of the sessions and of the school’s and Mother’s concern about Emily’s academic progress.

21. Father’s pattern of keeping Emily home from school on Mondays after his weekend time, and his refusal to bring her to tutoring and academic support sessions, substantially deviates from the expectations and circumstances that formed the basis for the May 15, 2022 Judgment.

22. These changes have occurred after the entry of the existing Judgment, are ongoing and persistent, and materially affect Emily’s welfare, education, and stability.

23. Father’s conduct effectively undermines Emily’s educational progress and is inconsistent with joint legal custody obligations to make major decisions concerning education jointly and in Emily’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31 (defining “shared legal custody” as mutual responsibility and consultation for major decisions including education).

24. The truancy warnings, declining academic performance, and Father’s ongoing refusal to prioritize Emily’s school attendance and tutoring represent a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2022 Judgment.

25. Mother remains willing and able to ensure regular school attendance, compliance with truancy laws, and participation in recommended tutoring and academic support, but her ability to do so is undermined by Father’s current pattern of conduct under the existing schedule and joint legal custody arrangement.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

26. Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting-time orders must at all times serve the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

27. Regular school attendance and participation in academic support services are essential to Emily’s educational development, emotional well-being, and long-term prospects, and therefore are core aspects of her best interests.

28. Father’s repeated unilateral decisions to keep Emily home from school on Mondays, absent medical necessity or cooperation with Mother and the school, compromise Emily’s educational stability and are contrary to Emily’s best interests.

29. Father’s refusal or failure to bring Emily to tutoring sessions, despite being aware of their importance, further undermines Emily’s academic progress and contributes to her declining performance.

30. The shared legal custody arrangement requires that both parents work together and make joint decisions concerning major issues such as education; Father’s pattern of disregarding school attendance requirements, ignoring truancy concerns, and refusing to facilitate tutoring demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to exercise joint legal custody responsibly with respect to educational matters. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (emphasizing cooperative decision-making under joint legal custody); Oliveira v. Oliveira, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2009).

31. Given the ongoing truancy warnings, the measurable decline in Emily’s academic performance, and Father’s pattern of undermining school attendance and tutoring, it is in Emily’s best interests that Mother be granted final decision-making authority over educational and school-attendance issues, or, in the alternative, that Father’s Sunday-night (school-night) overnights be reduced or restructured so as to protect Emily’s consistent attendance and academic support.

32. Modification of the existing Judgment to protect Emily’s school attendance and educational progress is necessary to serve her best interests and to prevent further educational harm. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests encompass emotional, intellectual, and physical welfare); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

### VI. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

33. G.L. c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Court to “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the modification is in the best interests of the child.

34. G.L. c. 208, § 31 directs that custody determinations be made in accordance with the best interests of the child, expressly including decisions concerning the child’s education and welfare.

35. G.L. c. 208, § 28A and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 similarly authorize modification of custody and visitation arrangements in appropriate circumstances.

36. Massachusetts appellate decisions reinforce that:  
   a. A material and substantial change in circumstances justifies modification of custody and parenting-time orders. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  
   b. The primary focus in custody and parenting-time matters is the best interests of the child, including educational and emotional stability. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  
   c. Where joint legal custody is unworkable due to a lack of cooperation or consistent conflict that affects the child’s welfare, the Court may modify the arrangement to grant one parent final decision-making authority in specific domains. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Oliveira v. Oliveira, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2009).  
   d. Stability and consistent routines, including school attendance, are essential elements of a child’s best interests. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

37. Taken together, these authorities support modifying the May 15, 2022 Judgment to address the significant problems now arising in Emily’s schooling as a direct result of Father’s conduct during his parenting time.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

38. Mother does not seek to eliminate Father’s meaningful relationship with Emily. Rather, she seeks targeted modifications that protect Emily’s education and school attendance while still allowing Father significant parenting time.

39. In light of the material change in circumstances and in order to serve Emily’s best interests, Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the May 15, 2022 Judgment as follows:

   a. **Educational Decision-Making / Legal Custody (Limited)**  
      i. That the Court modify the joint legal custody arrangement to provide that Mother shall have final decision-making authority regarding Emily’s education, including but not limited to:  
         1. School attendance and compliance with school attendance laws;  
         2. Responses to truancy notices and school discipline related to attendance;  
         3. Enrollment in, scheduling of, and attendance at tutoring, academic support, and remedial education services; and  
         4. Any individualized educational supports recommended by the school (including, if applicable, IEPs, 504 Plans, or similar supports).  
      ii. Father shall continue to share joint legal custody in other domains (such as non-emergency medical and major religious decisions), but where there is conflict regarding educational matters, Mother’s decision shall control, after good-faith consultation where practicable.

   b. **School-Night Overnights / Parenting-Time Schedule (Alternative or Additional Relief)**  
      i. In the alternative, or in addition, that the Court modify Father’s parenting time so that Father’s regular weekend parenting time ends on Sunday at a reasonable time (for example, 6:00 p.m. or as otherwise set by the Court), with no Sunday-night school-night overnights, so that Emily will be in Mother’s care on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings to ensure timely and consistent school attendance.  
      ii. The Court may adjust start and end times of Father’s parenting time as necessary to maintain a meaningful relationship between Father and Emily while still protecting Emily’s education.

   c. **Tutoring and Academic Support Compliance**  
      i. That the Court order both parties to ensure Emily’s attendance at all scheduled tutoring and academic support sessions recommended by the school or mutually agreed upon by the parties, and that:  
         1. If such sessions occur during Father’s parenting time, Father shall be responsible for transporting Emily to and from such sessions and shall not unreasonably withhold or interfere with her attendance.  
         2. Parties shall promptly inform each other of any scheduled or changed sessions and cooperate in rescheduling as needed, with Emily’s best educational interests as the primary consideration.

   d. **Informational Exchange and School Communication**  
      i. That the Court order both parties to sign any necessary forms to ensure that both Mother and Father have equal access to Emily’s school records and communications, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and applicable privacy laws.  
      ii. That the Court specifically authorize Mother to communicate directly with the school regarding Emily’s attendance and academic support and to take any steps reasonably necessary to correct truancy issues and support Emily’s education, consistent with her final decision-making authority in educational matters.

   e. **Other Appropriate Relief**  
      i. That the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper to protect Emily’s educational welfare and to serve her best interests, including but not limited to clarifying holiday schedules, adding provisions about make-up time, or entering any necessary orders to enforce school attendance.

### VIII. NO RETROACTIVE CHANGE IN SUPPORT REQUESTED HEREIN

40. This Complaint for Modification is focused solely on custody, legal custody, and parenting-time issues as they relate to Emily’s schooling and is not, by itself, requesting any retroactive modification of child support. To the extent that any future change in support may be warranted as a result of a change in the parenting schedule, such matters can be addressed by separate motion or as the Court deems appropriate.

### IX. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2022 Judgment regarding Emily Smith, specifically relating to Father’s pattern of keeping Emily out of school on Mondays, the resulting truancy warnings, and the decline in Emily’s academic performance, as well as Father’s refusal to bring Emily to tutoring and academic support sessions during his parenting time;

B. Find that it is in Emily’s best interests that the May 15, 2022 Judgment be modified to protect her school attendance, academic performance, and educational stability;

C. Modify the existing Judgment to grant Mother final decision-making authority regarding all educational matters for Emily, including but not limited to school attendance, responses to truancy concerns, and tutoring/academic supports, while maintaining shared legal custody in other domains;

D. In the alternative, or in addition, modify Father’s parenting-time schedule so that his regular weekend parenting time does not include Sunday-night school-night overnights, and instead ends at an appropriate time on Sunday evening, thereby allowing Mother to ensure Emily’s regular Monday school attendance;

E. Order both parties to ensure Emily’s attendance at all scheduled tutoring and academic support sessions and to cooperate fully with school recommendations and with each other in promoting Emily’s education;

F. Order such further and other relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of Emily Smith.

Respectfully submitted,
