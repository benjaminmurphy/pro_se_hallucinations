      "support_reasoning": "The case is a G.L. c. 151B gender discrimination and punitive damages decision, not a negligence or general tort damages case. While it discusses categories of damages such as back pay, front pay, and emotional distress within the statutory discrimination framework, it does not articulate a general Massachusetts rule that a negligence plaintiff is entitled to full and fair compensation for all proximately caused injuries including medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering. Therefore it does not support the broad tort-damages proposition asserted.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The jury awarded $17,700 in special damages, $125,000 in emotional distress damages, back pay of $95,000, and front pay of $733,307. See Stonehill College v. Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, 441 Mass. 549, 567-568, cert. denied sub nom. Wilfert Bros. Realty Co. v. Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, 543 U.S. 979 (2004) (to effectuate remedial purpose of statute, compensatory damages include those which are \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d of discriminatory act)."

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses liability, duty to warn, design defect, consortium, limitations, evidentiary issues, and excessiveness of the verdict, but it does not articulate any general rule about the categories of recoverable damages under Massachusetts negligence law. The only damages discussion concerns whether a $440,000 personal\u2011injury verdict (for serious hand injuries) was excessive, not a statement that plaintiffs are entitled to recover all past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and non\u2011economic damages. Thus it does not serve as authority for the broad compensatory\u2011damages proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In concluding that the judge committed no error of law, we consider Ezila\u2019s age (twenty-nine) and weekly earnings ($140) at the time of the accident; the loss of ninety-five per cent of the function of her right hand (her dominant hand); her inability to perform many household tasks or to obtain employment; her pain and suffering, particularly while her hand was in the machine and while she was in the hospital where her fingers were amputated and skin grafts undertaken; her disfigurement, including scars from skin graft operations; her future need for artificial hands; and her continuing discomfort and embarrassment."
