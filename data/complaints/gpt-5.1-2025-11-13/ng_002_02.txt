EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                   
MICHAEL THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present in Highland Park in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was the owner, keeper, and/or person in control of a large dog (the “Dog”) that was present and off-leash at Highland Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising out of the tort of negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional amount for civil actions in the District Court Department, exclusive of interest and costs, but does not exceed the maximum jurisdictional amount of the District Court. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A.

5. All of the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Newton Division of the District Court Department. Venue is therefore proper in this Court. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2; G.L. c. 218, § 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 15, 2023, at approximately afternoon hours, Plaintiff was jogging on a paved or packed-earth path in Highland Park in Newton, Massachusetts (the “Park”).

7. Highland Park is a public park owned and/or controlled by the City of Newton, and is regularly used by members of the public, including Plaintiff, for walking, jogging, and recreation.

8. At all relevant times, conspicuous signs were posted in the Park stating that all dogs must be on leashes, or words to that effect.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was jogging in a normal and careful manner along a designated path in the Park, keeping a proper lookout and using reasonable care for her own safety.

10. At or about the same time and place, Defendant was present in the Park with the Dog, which was a large dog capable of causing serious physical harm if it attacked or collided with a person.

11. Despite the posted leash-law signs, Defendant allowed the Dog to run loose and off-leash in the Park.

12. Defendant had a leash physically in his possession, which he was holding over his shoulder, but he chose not to attach the leash to the Dog.

13. Defendant was located approximately thirty (30) feet away from the Dog, standing and talking with friends, and was not maintaining proper control over the Dog.

14. The Dog suddenly and without warning charged aggressively toward Plaintiff, running directly at her while barking loudly.

15. As the Dog charged at her, Plaintiff reasonably perceived that she was in imminent danger of being attacked, bitten, or knocked down by the Dog.

16. Under the circumstances, a reasonable person in Plaintiff’s position would have feared for her safety and would have attempted to evade or avoid the charging Dog.

17. In an effort to avoid contact with the charging Dog, Plaintiff swerved abruptly off the jogging path.

18. As Plaintiff attempted to avoid the Dog and move away from its path of travel, she encountered an exposed tree root near the edge of the path and tripped.

19. As a result of tripping, Plaintiff fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path.

20. Plaintiff landed violently on the ground, striking and twisting her wrist, and immediately experienced significant pain.

21. The Dog came to a stop after Plaintiff fell, and did not make physical contact with Plaintiff. Defendant then called the Dog back to him.

22. Several other joggers and park users in the vicinity witnessed the Dog running loose, the Dog charging at Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s resulting fall and injury.

23. Plaintiff did not provoke the Dog in any way and had no prior interaction with the Dog at any time before the incident.

24. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the Dog’s being allowed to run loose off-leash and charge at her without adequate control by Defendant.

25. Following the fall, Plaintiff required emergency medical treatment and was transported, or presented herself, to a hospital emergency room.

26. Medical personnel diagnosed Plaintiff with a broken wrist (fracture) causally related to the fall.

27. Plaintiff required immobilization and use of a brace for a period of weeks, follow-up medical appointments, and other treatment related to the injury.

28. As a further result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred approximately $4,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for diagnosis, treatment, and care of her broken wrist.

29. Plaintiff also suffered lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $1,200 in lost income due to her inability to work for a period of time while recovering from her injuries.

30. Plaintiff additionally missed a piano recital for which she had been practicing extensively, resulting in emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and interference with her normal activities.

31. Plaintiff continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limitation of motion in her wrist, and may continue to do so in the future.

32. Plaintiff has suffered, and will continue to suffer, physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

33. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused solely by the negligence, carelessness, and/or reckless disregard of Defendant, without any contributory negligence on Plaintiff’s part. In any event, any negligence on Plaintiff’s part was less than any negligence of Defendant and does not bar her recovery. See G.L. c. 231, § 85.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Count I – Negligence (Common Law)**

34. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 33 above as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

35. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care in his or her actions so as to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000).

36. Defendant, as the owner and/or person in control of the Dog, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, control, and supervision of the Dog so as to prevent the Dog from creating an unreasonable risk of harm to persons lawfully present in the Park, including Plaintiff. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147; *Maillet v. Mininno*, 266 Mass. 86, 89 (1929).

37. Defendant further owed a duty to comply with applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations governing the control and restraint of dogs on public property, including leash requirements. The existence of such laws and posted signs at the Park informed and heightened the standard of reasonable care owed by Defendant. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 359 (1990) (violation of statute or regulation is evidence of negligence); *G. L. c. 140*, including §§ 155–174F (regulating dogs).

38. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating situations in which a large, unleashed dog could charge at or threaten park users, thereby causing them reasonably to take evasive action that could result in physical injury. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996) (duty extends to foreseeable risk of harm); *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 731–32 (2000).

#### Breach

39. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff by, among other things:

   a. Allowing the Dog to be off-leash in a public park where leash control was required by posted rules and applicable law;  

   b. Failing to attach the leash in his possession to the Dog;  

   c. Failing to maintain any or adequate physical control over the Dog;  

   d. Allowing the Dog to wander and run freely at a distance of approximately thirty (30) feet from Defendant;  

   e. Failing to supervise the Dog while he was engaged in conversation with friends instead of controlling the Dog;  

   f. Failing to prevent the Dog from charging and barking aggressively toward Plaintiff; and  

   g. Failing to timely call, restrain, or otherwise control the Dog so as to prevent it from charging at Plaintiff and placing her in reasonable fear of imminent harm.

40. Defendant’s conduct fell below that of a reasonably prudent dog owner under like circumstances and constituted negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Glidden*, 430 Mass. at 696–97; *Andrade v. Baptiste*, 411 Mass. 560, 565–66 (1992) (foreseeability and reasonableness standard).

41. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that permitting a large dog to run loose and off-leash in a public park where other people are jogging and recreating created a foreseeable risk that the dog could charge at, frighten, or collide with a person, causing that person to fall or otherwise be injured.

42. It was foreseeable to Defendant that a person confronted with a large, barking dog charging directly at them would instinctively attempt to evade or avoid the dog and could fall or be injured in doing so. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–48 (foreseeability of harm where defendant allowed dangerous instrumentality to be misused).

43. Defendant’s violation of the posted leash rules, as well as applicable dog-control statutes and/or ordinances, constitutes evidence of negligence. See *Bennett*, 408 Mass. at 359; *Guinan v. Famous Players-Lasky Corp.*, 267 Mass. 501, 516 (1929) (violation of statute or ordinance as evidence of negligence).

#### Causation

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions described above, the Dog charged at Plaintiff while barking, causing Plaintiff reasonably to fear being bitten, attacked, or knocked down.

45. Plaintiff’s decision to swerve off the path and attempt to avoid the Dog was a natural, instinctive, and foreseeable reaction to Defendant’s negligent failure to control the Dog and to the Dog’s aggressive charge.

46. In swerving to avoid the Dog, Plaintiff tripped over an exposed tree root and fell down a small embankment, causing her to suffer a broken wrist and other injuries.

47. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. See *Doull v. Foster*, 487 Mass. 1, 8–11 (2021) (substantial factor and factual cause in negligence actions).

48. The injuries suffered by Plaintiff were within the scope of the foreseeable risk created by Defendant’s conduct, and there were no superseding or intervening causes that would relieve Defendant of liability. See *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37, 45–46 (2009).

#### Damages

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury in the nature of a broken wrist and associated soft tissue injuries.

50. Plaintiff has incurred, and will continue to incur, reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of her injuries in an amount presently estimated at approximately Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($4,500.00), and potentially more, subject to proof at trial. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions).

51. Plaintiff has suffered lost wages and loss of earning capacity, presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00), and potentially more, subject to proof at trial.

52. Plaintiff has endured physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life, including but not limited to the inability to work for a period of time, limitations on daily activities, and the loss of the opportunity to perform in a piano recital she had practiced for extensively. See *Conway v. Electro Switch Corp.*, 402 Mass. 385, 390–91 (1988) (damages for pain and suffering); *Rodrigues v. State*, 52 Haw. 156, 472 P.2d 509 (1970) (recognizing emotional distress damages), cited favorably in *Payton v. Abbott Labs.*, 386 Mass. 540, 545–47 (1982).

53. Plaintiff has sustained, and may in the future sustain, residual impairment, discomfort, and limitation of motion in her wrist, and may require additional medical care, therapy, or treatment.

54. Plaintiff has suffered all of the above damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, but within the jurisdictional limits of this Court. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 60B, 85, 85J.

55. Under G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on any recovery at the statutory rate from the date of commencement of this action.

56. To the extent Defendant may argue comparative negligence, Plaintiff asserts that any negligence on her part, which she denies, was not greater than the negligence of Defendant, and therefore does not bar her recovery under G.L. c. 231, § 85, but at most would proportionately reduce damages.
