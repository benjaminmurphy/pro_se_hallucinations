CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE
______________________________


Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant, Grocer’s Market Inc. (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Grocer’s Market Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its principal place of business in Massachusetts, operating a grocery store located at 123 Dairy Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the Premises, including the aisles, floors, and common areas open to customers.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the law of negligence governing premises liability.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional amount for civil actions in the Somerville District Court, exclusive of interest and costs, and is within the Court’s monetary jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A, and 19C.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the cause of action arose in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, § 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 16, 2023, at approximately a Saturday afternoon hour, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a customer and business invitee of Defendant, shopping for groceries in the course of ordinary consumer activity.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Premises, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for business invitees, including the duty to inspect for, discover, remedy, and/or warn of dangerous conditions on the floors. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

9. While walking in the dairy aisle of the Premises, Plaintiff encountered a substantial puddle of spilled milk on the floor (the “Hazardous Condition”).

10. The spilled milk was not minor or hidden; it was large enough that there were visible shopping cart tracks through it, indicating that multiple customers and/or carts had already passed through the area since the spill occurred.

11. There were no “Wet Floor” signs, cones, warning placards, or any other form of warning in or near the area of the spill to alert customers to the Hazardous Condition.

12. The floor in the dairy aisle, in conjunction with the spilled milk, created a slippery and dangerous condition, posing an unreasonable risk of harm to customers, including Plaintiff.

13. As Plaintiff walked down the dairy aisle in a normal manner, without running, jumping, or otherwise engaging in any unreasonable behavior, she stepped into the puddle of spilled milk.

14. Upon stepping into the spilled milk, Plaintiff’s foot slipped out from under her, causing her to lose her balance and fall forcefully to the floor, landing on her hip.

15. At the time of her fall, there was a Grocer’s Market employee stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the Hazardous Condition.

16. After Plaintiff fell, the employee approached Plaintiff, and, in substance, stated that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago,” but was finishing what he was doing before going to retrieve a mop or otherwise clean the spill.

17. The employee’s admission demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual knowledge of the Hazardous Condition prior to Plaintiff’s fall and failed to take reasonable steps to timely clean, remedy, or warn of the spill.

18. Alternatively, the size of the spill, the visible cart tracks running through it, and the presence of an employee in close proximity indicate that the Hazardous Condition had existed for a sufficient length of time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it before Plaintiff was injured. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 166–67 (1973) (liability where condition existed long enough that defendant should have discovered it).

19. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, failed to promptly clean the spill, failed to place any warning cones or signs, failed to block off the area, and failed to otherwise warn Plaintiff or other customers of the dangerous condition.

20. Plaintiff was exercising due care for her own safety at all relevant times and had no actual knowledge of the spill prior to stepping in it.

21. Defendant’s acts and omissions described herein created an unreasonable risk of harm to customers, including Plaintiff, and constituted a breach of Defendant’s duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts premises liability law. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783–85 (2007).

22. After Plaintiff fell, she experienced immediate pain, particularly in her hip, but believed initially that the pain might subside and therefore completed her shopping trip and left the Premises.

23. That evening, Plaintiff’s hip pain significantly worsened, becoming severe and limiting her range of motion and ability to bear weight.

24. On or about the following day, Plaintiff sought medical care at an urgent care facility, where she was evaluated and diagnosed with a hip sprain.

25. Plaintiff’s treating providers recommended and prescribed physical therapy to address her hip injury, pain, and limitations.

26. Plaintiff subsequently underwent a course of physical therapy, incurring medical expenses and devoting time and effort to her recovery.

27. As a direct and proximate result of the September 16, 2023 fall, Plaintiff suffered a hip sprain requiring medical treatment and physical therapy, along with associated pain, suffering, and functional limitations.

28. Plaintiff’s medical expenses incurred as a result of the fall are approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00).

29. Plaintiff’s injury and resulting limitations caused her to miss work shifts at her café job, resulting in lost wages of approximately One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800.00).

30. In addition to economic damages, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional distress reasonably associated with her physical injuries.

31. Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Negligence – Premises Liability)

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, a business owner in possession and control of premises open to the public owes a duty of reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and invitees, and to protect them against foreseeable risks of harm. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

34. This duty includes, but is not limited to:  
   a. A duty to make reasonable inspections of the premises at reasonable intervals to discover dangerous conditions;  
   b. A duty to timely clean, repair, or otherwise remedy dangerous conditions of which the owner knows or should know; and  
   c. A duty to adequately warn lawful visitors and invitees of dangerous conditions that are known or reasonably should be known, and that are not open and obvious. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371–72 (2010); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 166–67 (1980).

35. Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, the above-described duties of reasonable care.

36. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to maintain the floor in the dairy aisle in a reasonably safe condition;  
   b. Failing to discover and remedy the spilled milk within a reasonable time after it occurred;  
   c. Failing to implement and/or follow reasonable inspection procedures to detect spills and similar hazards in customer areas;  
   d. Failing to promptly clean or otherwise correct the Hazardous Condition after Defendant’s employee observed or reasonably should have observed it;  
   e. Failing to place adequate warning signs, cones, or other devices around the Hazardous Condition to alert customers, including Plaintiff;  
   f. Failing to cordon off or block access to the area of the spill until it could be safely cleaned;  
   g. Allowing employees to continue stocking shelves or performing other tasks instead of promptly addressing a known spill that created a foreseeable risk of customer injury; and  
   h. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees regarding inspection, clean-up, and warning procedures for spills and slippery substances on the floor.

37. The employee’s statement that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” before Plaintiff’s fall demonstrates that Defendant had actual notice of the Hazardous Condition and unreasonably delayed in taking remedial or warning measures. See *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961) (store liable where employees had actual knowledge of condition and failed to correct it).

38. Even if Defendant did not have actual notice, the nature, size, and appearance of the spill, including visible cart tracks through it, and the presence of an employee nearby, demonstrate that the Hazardous Condition existed for a sufficient period of time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and corrected it, thereby establishing constructive notice. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 166–67 (1973); *Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry.*, 208 Mass. 273, 276–77 (1911).

39. Under Massachusetts law, a store operator is liable in negligence if it knew or reasonably should have known of a dangerous condition caused by a foreign substance on the floor and failed to take reasonable steps to protect patrons from that danger. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783–85 (2007) (discussing premises liability standards for slip-and-fall cases involving substances on the floor).

40. Defendant’s conduct, as set forth above, falls below the standard of reasonable care that a reasonably prudent supermarket operator would exercise under like circumstances. See *Uloth v. City Tank Corp.*, 376 Mass. 874, 881 (1978) (duty is to act as reasonable person in all circumstances).

41. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and her resulting injuries. But for Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions—including its failure to clean up the spill and/or warn of it—Plaintiff would not have slipped and fallen and would not have suffered a hip sprain or related harms.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury to her hip, including a hip sprain diagnosed by medical professionals, requiring medical treatment and physical therapy.

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred, and will continue to incur, reasonable and necessary medical expenses, presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00), and may incur additional medical expenses in the future.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained lost wages from missed work shifts at her café job, presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800.00), and may incur additional lost earnings or diminished earning capacity.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of normal activities, all to her damage.

46. Defendant’s negligence was greater than any negligence, if any, attributable to Plaintiff; therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85. See *Colter v. Barber-Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 59–60 (1988).

47. Plaintiff is entitled to recover her damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and compensation for pain and suffering, pursuant to Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest).

---

### V. DAMAGES

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions described herein, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages, among others:

   a. Past medical expenses associated with urgent care, evaluation, and physical therapy, in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,200.00;  
   b. Past lost wages in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,800.00 due to missed work shifts at her café job;  
   c. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, discomfort, and limitations related to a hip sprain;  
   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life associated with Plaintiff’s physical injury and its impact on daily activities; and  
   e. Such other and further economic and non-economic damages as may be proven at trial.

49. Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable monetary damages to fully and fairly compensate her for all injuries and losses caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with statutory prejudgment interest and costs, as allowed by law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Grocer’s Market Inc., and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, sufficient to fully compensate Plaintiff for all injuries and losses sustained as a result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to:

   1. Past and future medical expenses;  
   2. Past and future lost wages and/or loss of earning capacity; and  
   3. Past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life;

C. Post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND
