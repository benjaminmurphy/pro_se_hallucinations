While it discusses the child\u2019s bond with the father and his functioning at school, the case does not articulate a general principle about the importance of a stable, developmentally appropriate parenting schedule or affirmatively maintaining and strengthening the relationship with both parents. Its core legal holding is about mandatory consideration and findings regarding domestic violence, not about co-parenting or schedules between both parents.",

Requiring the courts to make explicit findings about the effect of the violence on the child and the appropriateness of the custody award in light of that effect will serve to keep these matters well in the foreground of the judges\u2019 thinking.\u201d"
