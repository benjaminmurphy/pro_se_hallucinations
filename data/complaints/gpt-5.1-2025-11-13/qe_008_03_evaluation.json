      "support_reasoning": "Wolfberg discusses G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 only to address whether a tenant may recover both c. 93A damages and the separate \u2018three months\u2019 rent\u2019 statutory remedy, and it holds that such recovery would be duplicative when the tenant already received more than three months\u2019 rent and actual damages under c. 93A. The opinion does not describe the \u00a7 14 remedy as being \u2018designed to deter landlord misconduct\u2019 in any general policy sense; rather, it characterizes the triple-rent clause narrowly as an incentive when actual damages are slight or hard to prove. Thus the case does not squarely support the broad deterrence proposition for which it is cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe judge awarded $990 (three months\u2019 rent) to the tenants on a finding that the landlord had violated G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment\u2026 The \u2018triple rent\u2019 clause of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, is \u2018an incentive to the pursuit of relief where the actual and consequential damages are slight or are difficult to prove.\u2019\u2026 We now hold that, where a tenant has been awarded in excess of both three months\u2019 rent and actual damages under G. L. c. 93A\u2026 the recovery of damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, would be duplicative and, therefore, will not be allowed.\u201d"
