SOPHIA MARTINEZ,  
    Defendant.  
-------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
-------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff, Jordan Tyler (“Plaintiff”), for a Complaint against Defendant, Sophia Martinez (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Tyler, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, basement apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Defendant, Sophia Martinez, upon information and belief, is an individual who owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The Premises are located in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Boston.

5. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3, and 6, because this action concerns residential premises located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and relates to the landlord-tenant relationship.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of a basement apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Apartment” or “Unit”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment from March 1, 2022, through the present.

8. The agreed monthly rent for the Apartment is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has generally paid rent when due. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late paying that month’s rent due to medical expenses.

10. Plaintiff subsequently paid the full October 2025 rent together with a late fee assessed by Defendant, and Defendant accepted that payment.

11. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has treated the Apartment as his primary residence and has complied in all material respects with his obligations as a tenant.

12. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff began to notice water seeping into the Apartment through a basement wall whenever it rained heavily.

13. The water infiltration was substantial enough to wet and soak portions of the floor and wall area, and to cause property damage and an unhealthy living environment.

14. The water seepage damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including at least one rug and one bookshelf placed against the affected wall, in an amount of approximately $400.

15. The presence of ongoing moisture required Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier essentially continuously in an effort to keep the Apartment livable, thereby increasing Plaintiff’s electricity costs.

16. The water seepage and resulting dampness created conditions that were and are unfit for human habitation and in violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to provisions requiring that the dwelling be maintained free from chronic dampness and water penetration (see, e.g., 105 C.M.R. 410.200, 410.500–410.504).

17. On or about early November 2025, shortly after discovering the problem, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message that water was seeping into the Apartment whenever it rained and asked that the condition be repaired.

18. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but no repairs were made and no professional was sent to investigate or remedy the condition within a reasonable time.

19. Over the following weeks, the water infiltration continued during heavy rains, and the condition remained unaddressed by Defendant.

20. After waiting a reasonable period and seeing no effective response from Defendant, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department and requested an inspection of the Premises.

21. The City’s inspector came to the Premises and identified the water infiltration problem as well as additional violations of the State Sanitary Code.

22. Upon information and belief, the City issued or was prepared to issue an inspection report and/or violation notice to Defendant describing the code violations and required corrections.

23. Defendant was thereby placed on notice by Plaintiff and by municipal authorities that the Apartment was in violation of the State Sanitary Code and that substantial repairs were necessary.

24. Despite such notice, Defendant has failed and refused to adequately repair the defective conditions causing the water seepage, and the problem persists as of the date of this Complaint.

25. The repeated water infiltration, continued dampness, and damage to Plaintiff’s property have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment, causing Plaintiff distress, inconvenience, and loss of use of parts of the living space.

26. As a further consequence of the unresolved water problem and the need to run a dehumidifier, Plaintiff has incurred additional electrical costs beyond his normal usage.

27. After Plaintiff reported the conditions and triggered the City inspection, Defendant began to characterize Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

28. Defendant has stated to Plaintiff that she will not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 (or, if month-to-month, at the end of the current term), asserting that the reason is Plaintiff’s prior late payment of rent in October 2025.

29. The timing and circumstances strongly indicate that Defendant’s decision not to renew Plaintiff’s lease was made in retaliation for Plaintiff’s exercise of his legal rights to report sanitary code violations to municipal authorities, and not for the October 2025 late payment, which had already been fully cured and accepted.

30. As a result of the ongoing defective conditions and Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to: (a) damage to personal property (approximately $400), (b) increased utility costs, and (c) loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment, emotional distress, inconvenience, and aggravation.

31. Plaintiff estimates that his total damages to date are at least $800, and he reserves the right to seek adjustment of this amount as additional damages accrue or become known.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–31 as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, which prohibits a landlord from, by act or omission, directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

34. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in substance, that any landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the tenant, by any act or omission, shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

35. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s failure to maintain premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, resulting in conditions that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

36. A landlord’s omission may violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord knows of defective conditions and fails to correct them within a reasonable time. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

37. Chronic or substantial water leaks, dampness, and related conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code have repeatedly been held to substantially interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment and support recovery under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

38. Here, Defendant, by her omissions, has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment by allowing conditions to exist and persist in violation of the State Sanitary Code, including chronic water penetration into the living space and resulting dampness.

39. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the defective and unhealthy conditions because Plaintiff notified her in or about early November 2025, and the City’s inspection identified the same issues.

40. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to make timely and adequate repairs, allowing the conditions to continue for an unreasonable period and thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

41. As recognized in Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and following cases, a landlord’s persistent failure to correct serious code violations is a significant interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment and supports an award of rent-related damages.

42. The water seepage and dampness also rendered the Apartment less habitable and impaired its value, which constitutes a substantial interference with the character and value of the leased premises within the meaning of the quiet enjoyment covenant. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–78 (1994).

43. Defendant’s acts and omissions also contravene the landlord’s obligations under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A, 127B, and 127H, and 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., to maintain the Premises in compliance with minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, which is relevant to determining breach of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994).

44. Defendant’s failure to remedy the water infiltration and related code violations, after notice from Plaintiff and municipal authorities, constitutes an “omission” that “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment” of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

45. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Damage to personal property in the approximate amount of $400;  

   b. Increased electricity costs to run a dehumidifier to mitigate moisture;  

   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Apartment; and  

   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and aggravation arising from living with persistent water infiltration and damp conditions.

46. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and governing caselaw, including Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), Plaintiff is entitled to recover his actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Although Plaintiff is self-represented at present, he seeks all statutory remedies that may apply, including fees if counsel is later retained.

47. Defendant’s decision not to renew Plaintiff’s lease after he contacted municipal inspectors, while nominally justified by an earlier late rent payment that had already been cured, further chills Plaintiff’s exercise of his statutory rights and underscores the seriousness of the interference with his quiet enjoyment, though Plaintiff asserts only the quiet enjoyment claim in this action.

48. Defendant’s conduct, in its totality, therefore constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### V. DAMAGES AND STATUTORY BASIS

49. Plaintiff currently estimates his actual damages (property damage plus increased utilities and loss of use/enjoyment) at approximately $800, subject to revision as facts develop.

50. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the greater of his actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent.

51. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200; three months’ rent therefore equals $3,600.

52. Accordingly, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff seeks statutory damages of not less than $3,600 (three months’ rent), together with court costs and such attorney’s fees as may become applicable if counsel is later engaged.

53. In support of this claim, Plaintiff relies upon G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A, 127B, 127H; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; and the following Massachusetts cases, among others:  

   - Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973);  
   - Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979);  
   - Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982);  
   - Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994);  
   - Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994);  
   - Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  
   - Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997);  
   - Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005);  
   - Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390 (1982);  
   - Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).
