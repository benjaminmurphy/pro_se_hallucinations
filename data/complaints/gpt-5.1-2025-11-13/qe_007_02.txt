v.                                                      Civil Action No. __________  

LYDIA GRANT,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Kevin Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, alleges as follows against Defendant Lydia Grant (“Defendant” or “Landlord”):


### I. PARTIES

1.  Plaintiff Kevin Thompson is an individual natural person who resides in and is a tenant of residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Premises”).

2.  Defendant Lydia Grant is, upon information and belief, an individual who owns, controls, manages, or otherwise exercises authority over the residential rental property in which the Premises are located, including the adjacent unit presently under renovation, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

3.  At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) chapter 186, including § 14, with respect to the Premises.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4.  This action is brought under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the common law and G.L. c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5.  Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 2 and 19, the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department has subject-matter jurisdiction over this civil action because the amount in controversy is within the court’s jurisdictional limit and the cause of action arises under Massachusetts law.

6.  Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court because the rental property that is the subject of this dispute is located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, § 2; G.L. c. 218, § 19.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

8.  On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

9.  Plaintiff has continuously resided in and lawfully occupied the Premises since on or about January 15, 2022, and has at all times materially complied with the obligations of his tenancy, including timely payment of rent and observance of reasonable rules.

10.  Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Premises is $2,500.00, payable to Defendant.

11.  As a matter of Massachusetts law, every residential lease or tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

12.  On or about early October 2025, Defendant commenced, or caused to be commenced, substantial renovation and construction work in the residential unit directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s unit at 123 Maple Street.

13.  Defendant informed Plaintiff before the renovation began that construction would be occurring in the neighboring unit. However, Defendant did not provide a detailed schedule, did not offer temporary alternative accommodations, and did not propose meaningful mitigation of the impact on Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of his home.

14.  From approximately early October 2025 through at least December 1, 2025 (the date of this Complaint), there has been ongoing, frequent, and persistent construction-related noise emanating from the neighboring unit, including but not limited to drilling, hammering, pounding, mechanical tool use, and workers’ loud conversation (collectively, the “Construction Disturbance”).

15.  The Construction Disturbance typically begins at or about 8:00 a.m. and continues until approximately 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and has done so on most weekdays for roughly two months.

16.  Plaintiff works from home and must conduct phone and video calls, concentrate on complex tasks, and maintain a reasonably quiet environment for his employment.

17.  The volume, frequency, and duration of the Construction Disturbance has made it extremely difficult, and at times practically impossible, for Plaintiff to effectively perform his work duties from the Premises.

18.  The continuous drilling, hammering, and loud conversation regularly intrude into Plaintiff’s living space, are plainly audible and disruptive in every main room of the Premises, and cause Plaintiff significant stress, loss of concentration, and loss of productive work time.

19.  In addition to noise, dust and construction debris from the adjacent renovation have traveled into the Premises through vents and other openings, causing visible dust accumulation inside Plaintiff’s unit, affecting the cleanliness and air quality in the Premises, and further diminishing Plaintiff’s comfort and use of his home.

20.  Plaintiff has notified Defendant about the severity of the Construction Disturbance and the dust infiltration, including that the impact on Plaintiff’s ability to work from home and to enjoy reasonable quiet use of the Premises has been substantial.

21.  Defendant has acknowledged the ongoing renovation and, in response to Plaintiff’s complaints, offered only a token rent reduction of approximately $100.00 off one month’s rent, notwithstanding the ongoing and serious interference spanning multiple months.

22.  Defendant has allowed the renovation work to continue with essentially the same level of noise and disruption, and, upon information and belief, the work is anticipated to continue for an additional month or two beyond the date of this Complaint.

23.  Defendant has not offered to:  
    a.  relocate Plaintiff temporarily to another unit or comparable quiet space;  
    b.  schedule especially noisy work at more limited times to reduce interference with Plaintiff’s work from home;  
    c.  install meaningful soundproofing or barriers;  
    d.  adequately seal vents or other pathways through which dust enters the Premises; or  
    e.  provide a rent abatement proportionate to the loss of use and enjoyment.

24.  The persistent Construction Disturbance and dust have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a residence and as his place of work.

25.  The interference has not been a mere inconvenience or trivial annoyance, but rather has been significant and continuing, effectively depriving Plaintiff of the ability to peacefully and reasonably enjoy his home during normal daytime hours for at least two months and likely longer.

26.  Defendant, as owner and landlord, has the power and control to direct, limit, or modify the manner and timing of the renovation work, to impose conditions on the contractors, and to take reasonable steps to minimize or abate the disturbance to Plaintiff, but has failed to exercise that control in a way that protects Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

27.  Defendant has thereby permitted and caused conditions on the property—namely the intense, prolonged construction noise and dust infiltration—that materially impair Plaintiff’s tenancy.

28.  Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss of quiet enjoyment, inconvenience, loss of use of his living space during significant portions of the day, stress, reduced ability to work productively from home, and other consequential harms.

29.  As a proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to: (a) loss of the full value of the rental premises for at least two months (and expected continuing interference), (b) diminished habitability and comfort, (c) interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises for work and rest, and (d) emotional and mental distress associated with the ongoing disruption.

30.  Plaintiff reasonably estimates his actual damages arising from this loss of quiet enjoyment to be at least $1,500.00, and reserves the right to amend this Complaint to increase the demand as additional damages accrue or further information becomes available.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts Common Law)**

31.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

32.  Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who, by any act or omission, “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable to the aggrieved tenant for actual and statutory damages, including, in appropriate cases, multiple damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.

33.  Massachusetts law implies a covenant of quiet enjoyment in every lease of residential premises. See, e.g.:  
   a.  Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977);  
   b.  Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  
   c.  Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982);  
   d.  Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997);  
   e.  Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).

34.  In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord, by action or inaction, creates or permits conditions on the property that substantially interfere with tenants’ use and enjoyment, even if the landlord does not specifically intend the interference.

35.  In Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, 417 Mass. 273 (1994), the Court reiterated that interference is “substantial” when it materially impairs the character and value of the tenancy, distinguishing such conditions from mere inconvenience or annoyance.

36.  In Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), the Court recognized that persistent, disruptive conditions (there, recurrent flooding and sewage problems) can give rise to liability for breach of quiet enjoyment and may support an award of damages for emotional distress.

37.  Similarly, in cases such as Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005), and Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), Massachusetts appellate courts have held that landlords may be liable for failing to prevent or remedy serious interferences, including noise and conditions that disturb tenants’ use of their homes.

38.  G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so is liable for actual and statutory damages.

39.  Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a statutory and common-law duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises and to refrain from acts or omissions that would substantially deprive Plaintiff of the beneficial use of the Premises.

40.  By undertaking, authorizing, or permitting extensive renovation and construction in the adjacent unit in a manner that created persistent, loud, and disruptive noise and allowed dust to infiltrate the Premises, without implementing reasonable mitigation measures, Defendant has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

41.  Defendant’s acts and omissions were within her control and foreseeably caused a level of noise and disturbance that went beyond that which is reasonably expected in multi-unit residential housing, especially for a tenant who works from home, and continued for a prolonged period with no adequate relief.

42.  The interference caused by the Construction Disturbance and dust has been “substantial” within the meaning of Massachusetts law, as it has materially impaired Plaintiff’s ability to live in, work in, and enjoy the Premises during normal daytime hours over a period of at least two months and continuing.

43.  Defendant’s conduct constitutes an “act or omission” that “directly or indirectly interfere[s] with the quiet enjoyment” of residential premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

44.  Defendant’s offer of a nominal rent reduction of approximately $100 for one month does not cure or negate the ongoing breach, particularly given that the interference has persisted and is expected to continue for multiple months.

45.  Even where landlords undertake building work for legitimate purposes, they remain obligated to avoid or reasonably limit substantial interference with tenants’ quiet enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord liable where its arrangements for lawful activity created ongoing disturbance); see also Doe, 417 Mass. at 283–84.

46.  Under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the cases interpreting it, a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment does not require proof of an intent to harm the tenant; it is enough that the landlord’s actions or failures to act foreseeably and substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 851.

47.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to loss of the full rental value of the Premises during periods of significant interference, disruption of work and daily life, discomfort, loss of peace and rest, and mental and emotional distress occasioned by the persistent disruption and dust.

48.  Plaintiff reasonably estimates his actual damages to be at least $1,500.00 and may seek additional damages as supported by evidence.

49.  Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to his actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs of the action and, in the discretion of the Court and as authorized by statute, reasonable attorney’s fees (even though Plaintiff is currently self-represented). See also, e.g., Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979) (discussing remedies under G.L. c. 186, § 14); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390 (1982) (landlord liability under § 14).

50.  Additional Massachusetts statutes and decisions reinforce tenants’ rights to habitable and reasonably quiet premises, including:  
   a.  G.L. c. 186, §§ 11–15 (tenant protections and remedies);  
   b.  G.L. c. 239, § 2A (retaliatory evictions and tenant protections);  
   c.  Trustees of Cambridge Point Condo. Trust v. Cambridge Point, LLC, 478 Mass. 697 (2018) (landlord/owner duties regarding building conditions);  
   d.  Hemingway v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing warranty of habitability, often applied together with quiet enjoyment principles).

51.  In light of the foregoing, Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy and as codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14.


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Kevin Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Lydia Grant, and grant the following relief:

A.  A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law;

B.  An award of actual damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00);

D.  An order that Defendant provide appropriate rent abatement and/or other monetary relief for the period during which Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been, and continues to be, substantially interfered with;

E.  An order requiring Defendant to take reasonable steps to abate and minimize further interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment arising from the ongoing renovation, including but not limited to limiting excessively noisy work, preventing dust from entering the Premises, and/or adjusting work practices to reduce disruption;

F.  An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

G.  An award of reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14, should Plaintiff subsequently retain counsel and incur such fees;

H.  Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff,
