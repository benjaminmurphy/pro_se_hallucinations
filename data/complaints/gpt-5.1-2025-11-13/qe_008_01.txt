CIVIL ACTION NO. ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant John Ramirez (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson is an individual residing at 45 Broadway Street, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant John Ramirez is, on information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts who is the owner and/or manager of the residential rental property located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Property”), and Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Chelsea Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the Property is located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

6. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises since on or about January 15, 2022, and has paid monthly rent in the amount of $1,500 to Defendant.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord, and Plaintiff has been Defendant’s residential tenant, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

8. The Premises is located in a multi-unit residential building with a main entry door providing access from the street into the building’s common hallway and basement area (the “Main Entry Door”).

9. At all relevant times, the lock and latch mechanism on the Main Entry Door has been defective and failed to engage properly, such that the door does not reliably latch and secure. The door can be pushed open from the outside by anyone, without a key or other authorization.

10. The defective Main Entry Door lock allows unrestricted access by members of the public to the building’s common areas, including the hallways and basement adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment.

11. The defective condition of the Main Entry Door lock constitutes a failure to provide reasonable security for the building and its occupants and is a violation of the landlord’s duty to maintain common areas in a reasonably safe condition. See, e.g., G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 186, § 15F; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.480, 410.750.

12. Approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint (around early October 2025), Plaintiff notified Defendant that the Main Entry Door lock was broken and did not latch properly.

13. Plaintiff informed Defendant that the door could be pushed open and that this condition posed a serious safety and security risk to Plaintiff and other residents of the building.

14. Defendant acknowledged the problem and stated that he would fix the lock; however, no repair was performed.

15. After her initial notification, Plaintiff reminded Defendant on at least two additional occasions that the Main Entry Door lock remained broken and continued to pose a security risk.

16. Despite multiple notices over a period of approximately two months, Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the defective lock on the Main Entry Door.

17. Defendant’s failure to repair the Main Entry Door lock was not accidental or due to mere oversight. Defendant was repeatedly informed of the serious nature of the defect, acknowledged it, and nevertheless chose not to correct it.

18. As a direct result of the unsecured Main Entry Door, unauthorized individuals have been able to enter the building’s common areas.

19. In or about November 2025, an unknown person or persons entered the building and went through tenants’ mail and packages left in the common hallway.

20. Several tenants, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the common hallway during this incident.

21. Plaintiff lost a package worth approximately $120 as a result of the unauthorized entry made possible by the broken Main Entry Door lock.

22. Plaintiff also began observing evidence that someone had been sleeping in the basement of the building, including bedding materials or similar indications of unauthorized overnight use.

23. The presence of unauthorized individuals in the basement and common areas, made possible by the defective Main Entry Door lock, is frightening, unsettling, and interferes with Plaintiff’s sense of security and peace in her home.

24. As a result of Defendant’s failure to secure the building and to repair the Main Entry Door lock, Plaintiff no longer feels safe entering or exiting her home, checking her mail, or leaving packages in the hallway.

25. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises has been substantially and seriously affected by the ongoing security problem, the theft of her property, and the fear and anxiety caused by unauthorized persons entering and using the common areas where she lives.

26. To protect herself from further harm and theft, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for her apartment door and a better deadbolt lock for her apartment.

27. Plaintiff spent approximately $200 of her own funds for the security camera and improved deadbolt lock.

28. Plaintiff would not have incurred these expenses but for Defendant’s failure to repair the Main Entry Door lock and provide basic building security.

29. When Plaintiff raised these issues and her concerns about safety, Defendant dismissed her concerns, told her she was “overreacting,” and stated that the neighborhood was safe, despite the thefts and evidence of unauthorized persons in the building.

30. Defendant has failed to take reasonable and necessary steps to provide basic security for the building or to remedy the broken Main Entry Door lock, despite having the ability and obligation to do so.

31. Defendant’s conduct has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, causing Plaintiff economic loss, emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of a basic sense of safety in her home.

32. As of the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), the Main Entry Door lock remains in a defective and unsafe condition, or was left defective for a substantial period following Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, continuing or having caused the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

33. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: (a) loss of personal property in the amount of approximately $120; (b) out-of-pocket security-related costs of approximately $200; and (c) non-economic harm including fear, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of her home.

34. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her damages to be at least $320 in out-of-pocket economic losses, plus additional amounts for the loss of quiet enjoyment and emotional distress associated with the interference with her tenancy.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14

35. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–34 as if fully set forth herein.

36. Under Massachusetts law, residential tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, implied in every lease and tenancy, and expressly protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

37. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

38. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from serious, substantial, or unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of their premises that is the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s acts or omissions. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–17 (1977).

39. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises and common areas in a reasonably safe and secure condition can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where it substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85; Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 851–52 (1997).

40. Landlords have a duty to maintain common areas, including entrance doors and locks, in a condition that is reasonably safe and secure for tenants. See, e.g., G.L. c. 186, § 15; Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162, 167–68 (1980) (landlord owes duty of reasonable care in common areas).

41. Massachusetts law and regulations require residential premises to be kept in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, including requirements for safe and secure egress and building security. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; particularly 105 C.M.R. 410.480 (locks) and 410.750 (landlord’s responsibility to maintain).

42. Defendant had actual notice, on multiple occasions, that the Main Entry Door lock did not latch properly and that unauthorized persons could and did enter the building, rummage through mail, and access the basement.

43. Defendant’s repeated failure to repair the Main Entry Door lock, despite notice and the foreseeable risk of theft, unauthorized entry, and tenant distress, constitutes at least negligent, and in the context of repeated complaints, reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights to safety and quiet enjoyment.

44. The theft of Plaintiff’s package, the presence of unauthorized individuals in the building, and the ongoing security risks were the natural and probable consequences of Defendant’s failure to maintain a working lock on the Main Entry Door. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716–17 (landlord liable where interference is natural and probable consequence of landlord’s actions or inaction).

45. Defendant’s conduct and omissions directly and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises by:  
   a. Allowing unauthorized persons to enter the building;  
   b. Failing to secure the building’s main entrance despite repeated notice;  
   c. Exposing Plaintiff to theft of her personal property; and  
   d. Creating a persistent atmosphere of fear, anxiety, and insecurity in and around Plaintiff’s home.

46. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been serious and substantial, not trivial or momentary, and has persisted for approximately two months or more.

47. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Loss of personal property valued at approximately $120;  
   b. Out-of-pocket costs of approximately $200 for a security camera and improved deadbolt; and  
   c. Non-economic damages for emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of the comfortable, safe, and peaceful use of her home.

48. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See, e.g., Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 760–61 (1979); Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

49. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500; three months’ rent therefore totals $4,500. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to a minimum recovery of three months’ rent ($4,500) or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, along with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Darmetko, 378 Mass. at 760–61.

50. Plaintiff also seeks such further equitable or declaratory relief as may be necessary to effectuate her rights and prevent ongoing or future interference with her quiet enjoyment, including orders that Defendant repair and maintain the Main Entry Door lock and otherwise ensure basic building security, consistent with G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law. See, e.g., Doe, 417 Mass. at 285 (recognizing equitable remedies in quiet enjoyment context).

C. Costs of this action, including filing fees and service costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;

E. Injunctive or equitable relief ordering Defendant to promptly repair and maintain a functioning, secure lock on the Main Entry Door and otherwise take reasonable steps to secure the common areas, in compliance with G.L. c. 186, § 14, G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, and 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.;

F. Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.
