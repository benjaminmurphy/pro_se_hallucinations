JORDAN REYNOLDS,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

QUICKRIDE RIDESHARE, LLC,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Jordan Reynolds (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC (“QuickRide” or “Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

------------------------------------  
I. PARTIES  
------------------------------------

1. Plaintiff Jordan Reynolds is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC is, on information and belief, a limited liability company that conducts business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including in Suffolk County, by providing rideshare transportation services through drivers operating motor vehicles under the QuickRide brand and platform.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted by and through its agents, servants, employees, and/or drivers, including the rideshare driver who caused Plaintiff’s injuries on August 15, 2023, all of whom were acting within the course and scope of their agency and/or employment with Defendant, and/or with Defendant’s actual, apparent, or implied authority.

------------------------------------  
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
------------------------------------

4. This is a civil action for negligence seeking monetary damages for personal injuries and related losses sustained by Plaintiff.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, such that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4.

6. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the causes of action arose in Suffolk County and the incident occurred at 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

7. Defendant conducts substantial business in Suffolk County and, on information and belief, maintains continuous and systematic contacts with Massachusetts sufficient for the exercise of personal jurisdiction under G.L. c. 223A, §§ 2, 3.

------------------------------------  
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
------------------------------------

8. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately morning commuting hours, Plaintiff was riding a bicycle to work in Boston, Massachusetts.

9. Plaintiff was traveling eastbound in a clearly marked bicycle lane on a busy street located at or near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

10. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating his bicycle in a safe, prudent, and lawful manner, in compliance with the Massachusetts motor vehicle and bicycle laws, including but not limited to G.L. c. 89, G.L. c. 90, and G.L. c. 85, § 11B.

11. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet, traveling with the flow of traffic, and remaining within the designated bicycle lane.

12. At the same time and place, a rideshare driver operating under the QuickRide Rideshare, LLC platform (the “QuickRide Driver”) had parked or stopped a motor vehicle in a loading zone directly adjacent to the designated bicycle lane.

13. The QuickRide Driver was an agent, servant, employee, and/or authorized driver of Defendant QuickRide Rideshare, LLC, acting within the course and scope of that relationship at the time of the incident, including picking up, dropping off, or waiting for passengers in connection with QuickRide’s business.

14. Without looking, signaling, or otherwise checking for oncoming bicycle traffic, and in violation of his duty to exercise reasonable care, the QuickRide Driver suddenly and forcefully swung the driver-side door of the vehicle open into the marked bike lane.

15. The QuickRide Driver opened the door at the precise moment Plaintiff was lawfully passing alongside the vehicle in the bicycle lane, leaving Plaintiff no reasonable opportunity to stop, swerve, or avoid collision.

16. As an immediate and direct result, Plaintiff’s bicycle collided with the sharp edge of the open driver-side door (“dooring” incident), causing Plaintiff to be thrown forward off the bicycle and violently onto the pavement.

17. Plaintiff landed on the roadway, sustaining impacts to his arms, legs, and mouth/teeth, and his bicycle sustained significant structural damage to its frame.

18. At the scene, the QuickRide Driver admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was “checking [his] phone,” or words to that effect.

19. The QuickRide Driver’s admission demonstrates that at the time he opened the door into the bike lane, he was distracted and not maintaining a proper lookout, and that he failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

20. The QuickRide Driver’s conduct constituted a failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances, and created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to cyclists using the adjacent bike lane.

21. Contrary to statements later made by or on behalf of the QuickRide Driver to his insurance company, Plaintiff was not “weaving in and out of traffic,” but was at all relevant times traveling in a straight, predictable manner within the marked bicycle lane.

22. Plaintiff did not contribute to the collision by any negligent act or omission; Plaintiff did not veer into the travel lane, ride erratically, or otherwise act in an unsafe manner.

23. The driver’s after-the-fact claim to his insurer that Plaintiff was “weaving” is inaccurate and is inconsistent with the driver’s contemporaneous admission at the scene that he failed to see Plaintiff because he was paying attention to his phone.

24. As a direct and proximate result of the QuickRide Driver’s negligent “dooring,” Plaintiff suffered the following injuries and damages, among others:

    a. Road rash and abrasions on both arms and legs;

    b. A chipped front tooth, requiring dental treatment;

    c. Damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle, including a bent frame rendering the bicycle unsafe or unusable;

    d. Pain, suffering, and emotional distress associated with the sudden impact, fall, and injuries;

    e. Interference with and loss of enjoyment of Plaintiff’s normal activities, including commuting, recreation, and exercise.

25. Following the collision, Plaintiff sought and received medical and dental care reasonably necessary to evaluate, treat, and ameliorate his injuries.

26. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses related to treatment for the road rash, abrasions, and chipped front tooth.

27. Plaintiff also incurred approximately $400 in lost wages due to missing work as a result of his injuries and medical/dental appointments.

28. Plaintiff’s bicycle was damaged beyond practical repair, requiring Plaintiff to purchase a replacement bicycle at his own expense.

29. Plaintiff notified the appropriate insurance carrier(s) of the collision and submitted a claim for his injuries and property damage.

30. Defendant’s driver, through his insurer, provided a version of events falsely suggesting that Plaintiff was weaving through traffic, in an apparent attempt to shift blame away from the driver’s own negligent conduct.

31. As a result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions through its driver, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer bodily injuries, pain and suffering, inconvenience, and financial losses, and will continue to be at risk for future dental issues related to the chipped tooth.

32. Plaintiff has complied with all applicable statutory and common-law prerequisites to bringing this action, to the extent any apply.

------------------------------------  
IV. APPLICABLE MASSACHUSETTS LAW  
------------------------------------

33. In Massachusetts, a driver of a motor vehicle owes a duty of reasonable care to all foreseeable users of the roadway, including bicyclists using marked bike lanes. See, e.g., G.L. c. 90, § 14; *Coombes v. Florio*, 450 Mass. 182 (2007) (recognizing duties of drivers to foreseeable third parties); *Grenier v. Town of Shrewsbury*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 103 (1982).

34. Massachusetts law requires the operator or passenger of a motor vehicle to exercise due care when opening a door into an area where traffic, including bicycle traffic, may reasonably be expected, and prohibits opening a vehicle door unless it is reasonably safe to do so and can be done without interfering with other traffic. See G.L. c. 90, § 14 (“No person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists…”).

35. A violation of a safety statute such as G.L. c. 90, § 14 is evidence of negligence. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990); *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401, 408 (1991).

36. Under G.L. c. 85, § 11B, bicyclists have the right to use public ways and are entitled to the same rights and subject to the same duties as drivers of motor vehicles, with additional protections afforded to them as vulnerable road users. See *Pace v. City of Boston*, 95 Mass. App. Ct. 1107 (2019) (Rule 1:28 decision recognizing protections for cyclists).

37. Massachusetts common law of negligence requires proof of (1) a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) damages. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

38. The duty of reasonable care extends to actions that create a foreseeable risk of harm to others, and “foreseeability” is a central component of the duty and causation analysis. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147; *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996).

39. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer or principal is vicariously liable for negligent acts of its employee or agent committed within the course and scope of employment or agency. See *Wang Laboratories, Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc.*, 398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986); *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).

40. A rideshare company that organizes, controls, and profits from the transportation services provided by its drivers may be held liable for the negligence of those drivers in performing the company’s business. See, e.g., *McMurdo v. Getter*, 298 Mass. 363, 365–66 (1937) (agency principles); *Kelly v. Rossi*, 395 Mass. 659, 661–62 (1985) (scope of employment).

41. Under the Massachusetts comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, a plaintiff’s contributory negligence, if any, does not bar recovery so long as the plaintiff’s negligence is not greater than the total negligence of all defendants, and any damages are diminished in proportion to the plaintiff’s degree of fault.

42. Damages for personal injuries caused by negligence in Massachusetts may include recovery for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See *Grassi v. Columbus Line S.p.A.*, 286 F.3d 461, 466 (1st Cir. 2002) (applying Massachusetts law); *Rodrigues v. Secretary of Admin. & Fin.*, 405 Mass. 697, 702 (1989).

------------------------------------  
V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST QUICKRIDE RIDESHARE, LLC)  
------------------------------------

43. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–42 as if fully set forth herein.

44. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting by and through its driver, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation, stopping, and exiting of its vehicle, including a duty to:

   a. Maintain a proper lookout for bicyclists lawfully using the adjacent bike lane;

   b. Refrain from opening a motor vehicle door into the bike lane unless it was first reasonably safe to do so and could be done without interfering with or endangering Plaintiff and other roadway users;

   c. Comply with all applicable statutes and regulations governing the safe operation of motor vehicles and interaction with bicyclists, including but not limited to G.L. c. 90, § 14 and G.L. c. 85, § 11B;

   d. Use reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to vulnerable road users such as bicyclists.

45. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant and its driver that suddenly opening a vehicle door into a marked bike lane, without checking for approaching bicycles, created a significant risk of collision and serious injury to bicyclists like Plaintiff.

46. Defendant, by and through its driver, breached its duty of care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to look for oncoming bicycle traffic before opening the driver-side door into the bike lane;

   b. Opening the motor vehicle door when it was not reasonably safe to do so, in violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14;

   c. Operating, stopping, and exiting the vehicle while distracted by a cell phone;

   d. Failing to appreciate and respond to the presence of a marked bicycle lane immediately adjacent to the vehicle;

   e. Failing to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person, and particularly a rideshare driver, would exercise under the same or similar circumstances;

   f. Failing to take reasonable precautions to avoid causing injury to Plaintiff, a foreseeable user of the bike lane;

   g. Failing to properly train, supervise, and instruct its rideshare driver regarding safe practices around bicyclists, including proper procedures for opening doors adjacent to bike lanes.

47. The QuickRide Driver’s conduct in opening the vehicle door into the bike lane without first ensuring it was safe to do so constituted negligence under Massachusetts law and was a direct violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14, which is evidence of negligence.

48. Defendant QuickRide is vicariously liable for the negligence of its driver under the doctrine of respondeat superior and principles of agency because, at all relevant times, the driver was acting within the course and scope of his relationship with QuickRide and in furtherance of QuickRide’s business.

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, as described above, Plaintiff’s bicycle collided with the open door, Plaintiff was thrown from his bicycle, and Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including but not limited to road rash on his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur medical and dental expenses in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,200, and such further amounts as may be proven at trial.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered lost wages of approximately $400 due to missed work, and may continue to suffer additional lost earnings and/or loss of earning capacity to be proven at trial.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s bicycle and related equipment were damaged, including a bent frame requiring replacement, and Plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for the reasonable cost of repair or replacement of such property.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, including interference with his ability to commute, exercise, and engage in normal daily activities without fear and discomfort.

54. To the extent, if any, that Plaintiff is found to have been negligent, which Plaintiff expressly denies, such negligence was not greater than the negligence of Defendant and/or its agents; therefore, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s recovery should not be barred and at most should be diminished only in proportion to any such comparative negligence.

55. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical and dental expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

------------------------------------  
VI. DAMAGES  
------------------------------------

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following categories of legally compensable damages under Massachusetts law:

   a. Past medical and dental expenses, presently estimated at approximately $1,200, and any additional amounts reasonably incurred and to be proven at trial;

   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $400, with proof of additional lost time or diminished earning capacity, if any, to be presented at trial;

   c. Property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle and related equipment, including the cost of repair or replacement of a bent frame and any other damaged components;

   d. Physical pain, suffering, and discomfort associated with Plaintiff’s injuries, treatment, and recovery;

   e. Emotional distress, anxiety, and mental suffering associated with the collision and its aftermath, including fear of bicycling in traffic;

   f. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with Plaintiff’s normal activities, hobbies, and daily routines;

   g. Such other and further economic and non-economic damages as may be proven at trial.

------------------------------------
