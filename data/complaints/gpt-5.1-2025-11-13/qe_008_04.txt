MICHAEL THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Santos (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Santos is an individual residing at 45 Broadway Street, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, including G.L. c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21, because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Chelsea Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 239, § 2, because the Premises are located in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy with Defendant for a residential apartment located at 45 Broadway Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts (the “Apartment” or “Rental Unit”).

6. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment as her home since on or about June 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of approximately $1,600 to Defendant.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable common law and has been responsible for maintaining the common areas and security of the building at 45 Broadway Street.

8. The building at 45 Broadway Street contains a main entry door that provides access to the interior common hallway and to tenants’ apartments, including Plaintiff’s.

9. For at least approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the main entry door to the building has had a broken or defective lock that fails to latch properly, such that the door does not secure shut and can be pushed open by any person without a key.

10. The main entry door lock problem substantially compromises the security of the building and permits unauthorized persons to enter the common areas, including the hallways and basement.

11. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the defective and non-latching main entry door lock approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, orally and/or by text, email, or other communication.

12. At that time, Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would have the lock repaired but failed to do so within a reasonable time.

13. After Plaintiff’s initial complaint, the condition persisted. Plaintiff reminded Defendant at least twice more over the following weeks that the main entry lock was still not working and that the building remained insecure.

14. Despite repeated notice and opportunity to repair, Defendant failed and refused to correct the defective lock or otherwise secure the main entry to the building.

15. As a result of Defendant’s failure to maintain a secure main entry door, unauthorized individuals have entered the building.

16. Approximately one month prior to the filing of this Complaint, an unknown person or persons entered the building and went through the tenants’ mail and packages in the common hallway.

17. A number of tenants, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the hallway at that time.

18. Plaintiff had at least one package stolen from the common hallway, with a value of approximately $120.

19. Plaintiff reasonably believes that the theft of her package and the disturbance of tenants’ mail were made possible or materially facilitated by the defective and unsecured main entry door lock and Defendant’s failure to repair it.

20. Plaintiff has also discovered evidence that an unknown person or persons have been sleeping or otherwise occupying the basement of the building without authorization, which Plaintiff reasonably believes is due to the building being easily accessible through the broken main entry door.

21. These intrusions have caused Plaintiff to feel unsafe in her home, to suffer anxiety and distress, and to reasonably fear for her personal security and the security of her property.

22. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment as a safe and habitable dwelling have been materially and substantially impaired by the repeated unauthorized entries into the building and the ongoing failure of the main entry lock.

23. To protect herself in the absence of effective action by Defendant, Plaintiff has incurred expenses to purchase and install a security camera for her own apartment door and an upgraded deadbolt lock, at a cost of approximately $200.

24. Plaintiff has requested that Defendant address the safety and security issues by repairing or replacing the defective main entry lock, but Defendant has failed to do so.

25. Instead, Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns, stating that she is “overreacting” and that the neighborhood is safe, despite the actual incidents of theft and unauthorized occupancy.

26. Defendant’s failure to repair the main entry door lock and to secure the building’s common areas is unreasonable, especially after repeated written and/or oral notice and the occurrence of theft and suspected trespass.

27. Maintaining a functioning, secure exterior entry door lock is a basic and essential aspect of safe and habitable housing, and the lack of such security interferes with tenants’ right to occupy their homes without unreasonable disturbance, fear, or risk of criminal activity.

28. Defendant’s acts and omissions, including the failure to repair the defective lock and ensure reasonable building security after notice and actual incidents of theft and trespass, have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered economic loss, including but not limited to the value of stolen property (approximately $120) and out-of-pocket security-related expenses (approximately $200), and non-economic damages in the form of anxiety, loss of peace of mind, and diminished use and enjoyment of her home.

30. Plaintiff estimates that, at a minimum, she has sustained actual damages of approximately $320, exclusive of statutory multipliers, interest, costs, and any reasonable attorney’s fees that may be available.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

31. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, both by statute and common law. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

33. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises without substantial interference attributable to the landlord’s acts or omissions, including the landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to address conditions under his control that foreseeably cause substantial interference. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 717–19 (1977); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 283 (1994).

35. Landlords in Massachusetts are also obligated to maintain rental premises, including common areas and building entryways, in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and basic standards of safety and habitability. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 198–201 (1973); 105 C.M.R. 410.480–410.482 (security and egress).

36. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that serious security defects and failures to protect tenants from foreseeable criminal or disruptive intrusions can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment where they materially impair the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g., *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997).

37. Defendant had control over and responsibility for the maintenance, repair, and security of the main entry door and lock to the building at 45 Broadway Street, including the common areas leading to Plaintiff’s Apartment.

38. Plaintiff gave Defendant repeated notice, beginning at least approximately two months before this Complaint, that the main entry lock did not latch properly and that unauthorized persons could and did enter the building.

39. Defendant knew or should have known that a non-functioning exterior lock created a foreseeable risk that intruders would enter the building, interfere with mail and packages, trespass in common areas such as the basement, and cause tenants to feel unsafe and insecure in their homes.

40. Despite such notice, and despite the actual occurrence of theft of mail and packages from the common hallway, Defendant failed and refused to repair the defective lock or otherwise reasonably secure the entryway.

41. Defendant’s failure to act under these circumstances was unreasonable and rose to the level of “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 717–19 (landlord may be liable where landlord’s conduct or inaction sets in motion forces that interfere with tenant’s quiet enjoyment); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 283.

42. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was substantial and not merely trivial or transitory. The building was left unsecured for an extended period of time; unauthorized persons entered the premises; tenants’ mail and packages were rifled through and stolen; there is evidence of trespassers sleeping in the basement; and Plaintiff’s sense of safety, privacy, and security has been significantly diminished.

43. Plaintiff’s situation is distinguishable from minor inconveniences; rather, it involves ongoing security breaches and the fear of crime in the home, which Massachusetts courts have recognized as serious interferences with quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–05 (recognizing mental distress and anxiety caused by landlord’s failure to address serious conditions as compensable); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (landlord liable under § 14 where failure to act after notice caused serious interference).

44. Defendant’s failure to maintain secure common areas also violates the landlord’s obligation to keep the premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, and such violations are evidence of breach of quiet enjoyment and habitability. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 200–01; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–203 (1979); G.L. c. 239, § 8A.

45. Under Massachusetts law, when a landlord fails to remedy dangerous or seriously defective conditions within a reasonable time after notice, that failure is attributable to the landlord and supports liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.*, 340 Mass. 124, 127–28 (1959); *Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476–78 (2004).

46. Defendant’s conduct was at least reckless or indifferent to Plaintiff’s rights, in that Defendant knew of the problem, knew of actual theft and trespass, and nevertheless failed to take even basic steps such as repairing or replacing the lock or adding security measures to the main entry.

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of personal property due to theft of packages from the common hallway (approximately $120);

   b. Out-of-pocket expenses to purchase and install a security camera and better deadbolt to partially mitigate the unsafe conditions created by Defendant’s inaction (approximately $200);

   c. Loss of the full use and enjoyment of her home as a safe and secure residence;

   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, fear, and loss of peace of mind associated with continuing security concerns, theft, and evidence of trespassers occupying the basement.

48. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as the costs of this action and a reasonable attorney’s fee. Three months’ rent at $1,600 per month is $4,800.

49. Plaintiff therefore seeks, at a minimum, statutory damages of three months’ rent ($4,800) pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, plus costs, interest, and any reasonable attorney’s fees that the Court may deem appropriate if counsel later appears on Plaintiff’s behalf.

C. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, including G.L. c. 231, § 6B;
