The Court holds that if the landlord\u2019s omissions in addressing third-party criminal activity create a condition that substantially interferes with tenants\u2019 use of the premises, that may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment under \u00a7 14. This directly supports the proposition that indirect actions or omissions that substantially impair tenants\u2019 comfort, safety, or use are sufficient to violate \u00a7 14 without actual eviction.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interference with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold. \u2026 Thus, a landlord may not intend to violate a tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment, but may do so nevertheless when the breach is a \u2018natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done.\u2019 \u2026 If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

It does not discuss retaliation for reporting code violations, G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 18, the Sanitary Code enforcement scheme, or the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
