      "citation_type": "case",
      "proposition": "The presence of rodent droppings in the kitchen and food storage areas has effectively deprived Plaintiff of the full and safe use of that portion of the Premises, resulting in a partial constructive eviction of that area.",

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The case does support the general doctrine of constructive eviction where a landlord\u2019s acts or omissions render premises unfit for use, but it does not involve or discuss rodent droppings, kitchens, or partial constructive eviction of a particular area of a unit. The constructive eviction found here was based on smoke, soot, fumes, and resulting health issues that deprived the tenant of use and enjoyment of the entire apartment. Using this case as authority specifically for rodent contamination of kitchen/food storage areas and partial constructive eviction overstates and mischaracterizes its holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cA constructive eviction has been defined\u2026 as \u2018some act of a permanent character, done by the landlord with the intention and effect of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the demised premises or some part of it, to which he yields, abandoning the possession within a reasonable time.\u2019 \u2026 In all the circumstances we are of opinion that the landlord must be presumed to have intended the natural consequences of its own acts\u2026 in failing to remedy the conditions which deprived the tenant of the use and enjoyment of the premises over a substantial period of time, and that the judge was warranted\u2026 in concluding that the tenant had been evicted by the landlord.\u201d"
