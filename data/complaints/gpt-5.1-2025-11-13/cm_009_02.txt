COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BARNSTABLE DIVISION  

------------------------------------------------------  
LAURA SMITH,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                   Docket No. __________  
MARK JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Smith (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Smith, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, age 8.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), upon information and belief, now resides on or near Cape Cod in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Plaintiff’s residence and from the minor child’s school.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A, and 31B, and/or M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as applicable, because the existing custody and parenting time orders were entered in this Court, the minor child has resided in Massachusetts for more than six (6) months immediately preceding the filing of this Complaint, and Massachusetts is the child’s home state under the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (M.G.L. c. 209B; M.G.L. c. 209B § 2).

4. On May 15, 2019, the Barnstable Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary Order incorporated into a final judgment) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child (the “2019 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2019 Judgment, the Mother was granted primary physical custody of the minor child, with the Father receiving:  
   a. Parenting time on alternate weekends; and  
   b. One midweek overnight on Wednesdays, with the minor child to attend school the following Thursday morning.

6. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, both parties lived in the same town, and the minor child’s travel time from the Father’s residence to her school for the Thursday morning following the Wednesday overnight was approximately five (5) minutes.

7. Venue in this Court is proper because the prior judgment was issued in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court and the minor child continues to be subject to this Court’s jurisdiction. See M.G.L. c. 215, § 3; M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s best interests, specifically involving the Father’s relocation and the resulting impact on the child’s sleep, school routine, and overall well‑being.

9. After entry of the 2019 Judgment, the Father relocated from the parties’ former town to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles away from the minor child’s school and the Mother’s residence.

10. Despite this significant change in distance and travel time, the Father has insisted on exercising the same midweek Wednesday overnight, now requiring the minor child to travel roughly ninety (90) miles to the Father’s residence on Wednesday after school and another ninety (90) miles back to school early Thursday morning.

11. In order to have the child present at school on time on Thursday mornings, the Father routinely wakes the minor child at approximately 4:30 a.m. to begin the drive back from Cape Cod.

12. As a direct result of this schedule, the minor child is often exhausted on Thursdays, has difficulty waking, and arrives at school tired, which negatively affects her energy, attention, and participation in class.

13. The minor child’s teacher has reported to the Mother that the child’s participation and engagement in class have noticeably declined on Thursdays in comparison to other days of the week.

14. The midweek overnight, which at the time of the 2019 Judgment involved a brief, five‑minute commute, has effectively become a three‑hour round‑trip on a school night, causing disruption to the child’s sleep schedule, morning routine, and school performance.

15. The Father’s move to Cape Cod, the dramatically increased commute, and the ongoing requirement that the child awaken extremely early and travel long distances on a school night are changes that were not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2019 Judgment.

16. These post‑judgment developments constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s best interests, necessitating modification of the parenting time schedule as to midweek overnights and associated transitions. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–39 (1996) (modification requires material change in circumstances and best interests analysis); Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981) (post‑judgment modification must be based on materially changed circumstances).

### III. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD

17. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a judgment as to custody or parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.

18. M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 provides that in allocating custody and parenting time, “the happiness and welfare of the children shall determine” the Court’s decision, and the Court must consider all relevant factors bearing on the child’s best interests.

19. Massachusetts appellate courts have held that when post‑judgment circumstances affecting a child’s daily life and stability significantly change, and the existing order is no longer consistent with the child’s best interests, a Probate and Family Court may and should modify the order. See, e.g.:  
   a. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (material change in circumstances standard and best‑interests analysis govern custody modification);  
   b. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (best interests of the child is the “overarching principle” in all custody determinations);  
   c. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (stability is important, but modifications are appropriate where the existing arrangement no longer serves the child’s best interests);  
   d. Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (court must consider overall welfare and practical realities of parenting arrangements);  
   e. Boucher v. Boucher, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 35 (2016) (substantial changes in circumstances, including those affecting schooling and routine, can warrant modification);  
   f. Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (changes in a parent’s residence and related impacts on child’s life relevant to modification);  
   g. Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2016) (best‑interests inquiry centers on the child’s day‑to‑day welfare and development);  
   h. Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (court may modify parenting time when post‑judgment circumstances materially affect children’s well‑being);  
   i. Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (focus of modification is current and future welfare of the child, not the interests of parents);  
   j. Blake v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 (1992) (child’s best interests are paramount in revising custody/visitation orders).

20. The best‑interests standard requires examination of factors including, but not limited to: the child’s age and developmental needs; stability of the home and school environment; the child’s emotional, physical, and educational welfare; each parent’s ability to meet the child’s needs; and the practical realities of any proposed parenting plan. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843‑44; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 547‑48.

21. Where a schedule that was previously reasonable and appropriate has, because of post‑judgment changes, become inconsistent with the child’s educational needs, sleep, and overall well‑being, the Court is authorized to modify parenting time in order to protect the child’s best interests. See Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–39; Murray, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 154–55; Boucher, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 39–40.

### IV. IMPACT ON THE CHILD’S BEST INTERESTS

22. The minor child, Emily Johnson, is eight (8) years old and is enrolled in elementary school. At this developmental stage, consistent sleep, rest, and a predictable routine are critical to her academic performance, behavior, and emotional regulation.

23. The current midweek Wednesday overnight requires the child to spend many hours in a car on a school night and to wake up at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings, which is not conducive to healthy sleep habits or optimal school functioning.

24. The report from the child’s teacher that Emily’s participation and engagement in class significantly decline on Thursdays is consistent with the detrimental effects of chronic early waking and lengthy commutes on school days.

25. The present schedule undermines the stability the 2019 Judgment was designed to provide, by transforming what was once a short, convenient midweek overnight into a burdensome and exhausting routine for the child.

26. It is not in Emily’s best interests to be routinely deprived of adequate sleep and subjected to extended nighttime/early‑morning travel simply to preserve a parenting schedule that was premised on the parties’ prior geographic proximity, which no longer exists.

27. Consistent with M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 and Massachusetts case law, the child’s happiness, welfare, schooling, and daily functioning must take precedence over preserving a midweek overnight that is now impractical and harmful. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 547–48; Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 192–93.

28. The modification requested by the Mother is limited, targeted, and narrowly tailored to remedy the harm created by the Father’s increased distance from the child’s school and to restore a reasonable, developmentally appropriate routine for Emily.

29. The requested modification would maintain the Father’s relationship with the child and preserve his alternate weekend parenting time, while eliminating only the specific aspect of the schedule—the midweek overnight and associated long‑distance travel on a school night—that has been shown to conflict with the child’s best interests.

30. Adjusting the weekend schedule, if necessary, to offer the Father additional weekend or non‑school‑night time with the child would help maintain and support the parent‑child relationship without compromising the child’s sleep, schooling, or day‑to‑day welfare.

31. Under the totality of the circumstances, including the Father’s relocation, the extended travel required, the early wake‑ups, the child’s observable fatigue, and the teacher’s report of diminished participation, it is in Emily’s best interests that the midweek overnight be eliminated and the weekend schedule be reasonably adjusted. See Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–39; Murray, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 154–55; Boucher, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 39–40; Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

32. The Mother does not seek to alter legal custody, but seeks a modification of the existing parenting time schedule to reflect the parties’ changed circumstances and to align the schedule with the child’s best interests.

33. Specifically, the Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Eliminate the Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight during the school year, such that the child will reside with the Mother on Wednesday nights when school is in session;  
   
   b. Provide that the Father’s parenting time during the school year be exercised on alternate weekends, beginning on Friday after school (or at a reasonable after‑school time, such as 5:00 p.m.) and ending on Sunday at a reasonable evening time (such as 6:00 p.m.), or at such times as the Court deems appropriate;  
   
   c. Provide that exchanges occur at the child’s school or another mutually agreeable location that minimizes disruption to the child’s schedule;  
   
   d. Permit the parties, by written agreement, to allow the Father midweek parenting time on a non‑overnight basis (e.g., dinner visits) that does not require excessively early wake‑ups or long drives on a school night;  
   
   e. Provide that during school vacations, holidays, and summer (if the Court deems it appropriate), the parties may exercise additional parenting time, including overnights, by agreement or in accordance with a schedule set by the Court, so long as such time does not interfere with the child’s school attendance and is consistent with her best interests; and  
   
   f. Enter such further orders as may be necessary to implement the modified schedule in a clear, practical, and child‑focused manner.

34. The Mother’s proposed modification respects the Father’s important role in the child’s life and preserves substantial parenting time, while remedying the specific change in circumstances—namely, the Father’s relocation and the now‑unreasonably long midweek commute—that has made the current midweek overnight schedule contrary to Emily’s welfare.

35. The requested relief is consistent with M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and Massachusetts appellate decisions emphasizing that custody and parenting time orders must be flexible to respond to post‑judgment changes that affect the child’s daily life and best interests. See Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–39; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 547–48; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 183–85; Pizzino, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 871–72; Boucher, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 39–40; Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 192–93; Murray, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 154–55; Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05; Blake, 413 Mass. at 827–28.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2019 custody and parenting time judgment, including, without limitation, the Father’s relocation approximately ninety (90) miles away from the child’s school and the resulting impact on the child’s sleep, school performance, and overall well‑being;

B. Determine that modification of the existing parenting time order is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31 and applicable Massachusetts case law;

C. Modify the 2019 Judgment to:

   1. Eliminate the Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight during the school year;  
   2. Provide that the child shall reside with the Mother on school‑night Wednesdays;  
   3. Establish that the Father shall have parenting time on alternate weekends, from after school (or a reasonable time) on Friday until a reasonable evening time on Sunday, or at such specific times as the Court orders;  
   4. Permit reasonable, non‑overnight midweek contact or visits by agreement that do not interfere with the child’s sleep or schooling; and  
   5. Adjust, if necessary, holiday, vacation, and summer schedules in a manner that preserves the Father’s relationship with the child while protecting the child’s best interests;

D. Order that all prior orders of this Court not inconsistent with the modified parenting time order shall remain in full force and effect;

E. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LAURA SMITH,  
pro se
