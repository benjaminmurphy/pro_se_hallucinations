                      COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
                             (NEGLIGENCE ONLY)

Plaintiff Jessica Carter (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Reynolds (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                             I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Thomas Reynolds is, upon information and belief, an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts 01201.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, occupied, controlled, and/or was responsible for the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts (the “Property”), including the yard and trees adjacent to and overhanging the public sidewalk.

                       II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injuries arising under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, based upon negligence.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore falls within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Berkshire County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the cause of action arose in Berkshire County and the Property where the incident occurred is located in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

                            III. FACTS

7. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant was the owner and person in control of the Property at 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, including a large, mature maple tree located in front of the house, adjacent to the public sidewalk.

8. For a significant period of time prior to July 15, 2023, a major limb or branch of that maple tree extended over and above the public sidewalk used by pedestrians, including Plaintiff.

9. Well before July 15, 2023, the branch in question was visibly cracked, drooping, and appeared unstable and hazardous to a reasonable observer.

10. Plaintiff regularly walked along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street in the course of her daily activities, including grocery shopping, and had personally observed the cracked, drooping branch hanging over the sidewalk.

11. On information and belief, various neighbors and residents of the area, on multiple occasions prior to July 15, 2023, noticed the cracked condition and sagging of the overhanging branch and communicated their concerns to Defendant.

12. On information and belief, these neighbors specifically warned Defendant that the branch appeared dangerous and unstable and suggested that he contact a professional arborist or tree service to inspect and remedy the condition.

13. In response to these concerns, Defendant stated, in substance, that he would “deal with it in the spring,” or otherwise postpone any action, but he failed to have the tree inspected, trimmed, or made safe in a timely manner.

14. Despite these specific warnings and the obvious, visible dangerous condition of the cracked branch directly over a public walkway, Defendant took no reasonable steps to inspect, remove, brace, or otherwise render safe the hazardous limb before the incident described below.

15. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was walking on the public sidewalk immediately adjacent to and in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, returning from a grocery store while carrying grocery bags.

16. On that date and time, the Berkshire County region was experiencing a fairly normal summer thunderstorm, with rain and wind, but no extreme weather, no tornado warnings, and no unusual or unforeseeable meteorological conditions.

17. While Plaintiff was lawfully and reasonably using the public sidewalk in front of Defendant’s Property, the cracked and drooping branch suddenly snapped and fell from the maple tree.

18. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground and causing her to experience immediate pain, shock, and emotional distress.

19. As a direct result of the falling branch, Plaintiff sustained injuries including, but not limited to, a shoulder strain and multiple bruises to her body.

20. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for her injuries.

21. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses related to treatment for the injuries sustained in the incident, including doctor visits, diagnostic evaluation, and any prescribed therapy or medication.

22. As a further direct result of the incident and her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work at her retail job for approximately one week.

23. During this time, Plaintiff suffered lost wages of approximately $600.

24. Plaintiff also experienced pain, suffering, physical discomfort, limitations on her daily activities, and emotional distress as a result of the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence.

25. Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the failure to remedy or remove the visibly cracked, drooping tree branch hanging over a pedestrian sidewalk.

26. The normal summer thunderstorm of July 15, 2023, was not an extraordinary, unforeseeable, or “Act of God” event; rather, it was the type of routine weather that occurs regularly in Massachusetts and that a reasonably prudent property owner should anticipate when assessing the safety of trees and branches overhanging public ways.

27. Defendant had actual and constructive notice of the defective and dangerous condition of the cracked, drooping branch for a substantial time before the incident and had more than sufficient opportunity to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the risk of harm.

28. Despite this knowledge and opportunity, Defendant negligently failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, prune, remove, or otherwise secure the dangerous branch, thereby unreasonably endangering pedestrians, including Plaintiff, using the public sidewalk.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the above-described injuries and damages.

                           IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                                NEGLIGENCE

30. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of land owes a duty to all lawful entrants, including those lawfully on adjacent public sidewalks, to act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances to prevent foreseeable harm arising from conditions on the property. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–708 (1973) (imposing duty of reasonable care toward all lawful visitors).

32. Massachusetts has long recognized that a landowner must exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to persons on adjoining public ways arising from dangerous conditions on the land, including trees. See, e.g., Richmond v. Warren Inst. for Sav., 307 Mass. 483, 485–86 (1940) (landowner may be liable for injuries from defective conditions adjacent to public way when there is notice and failure to act); United Elec. Light Co. v. Deliso Constr. Co., 315 Mass. 313, 317–18 (1943) (duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to those lawfully on nearby public ways).

33. A landowner has at least a duty to take reasonable steps when there is actual or constructive notice that a tree or its limbs present an unreasonable risk of harm to persons on a public sidewalk or way. See Ponticas v. K.M.S. Invs., 331 N.W.2d 907, 912 (Minn. 1983) (duty to act upon knowledge of a dangerous condition) (cited as persuasive authority for general negligence principles); see also Prosser & Keeton, Torts § 57 (5th ed.) (duty arises when dangerous condition and foreseeability of harm are known or should be known).

34. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances to maintain the tree and its overhanging branches in a reasonably safe condition with respect to pedestrians using the public sidewalk adjacent to the Property. See Mounsey, 363 Mass. at 707–708; Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244, 246–48 (1982) (duty of reasonable care and foreseeability principles).

35. That duty included, among other things, a duty to:

    a. Inspect the tree and its overhanging limbs with reasonable frequency, especially when a major branch appeared cracked, drooping, or otherwise visibly compromised;

    b. Heed complaints and warnings from neighbors and other community members regarding the hazardous condition of the overhanging branch;

    c. Retain, when necessary, a competent arborist or tree professional to assess and address the condition of the tree and its branches;

    d. Remove, trim, brace, or otherwise remedy any limb or condition that posed an unreasonable risk of harm to persons using the sidewalk below; and

    e. Take reasonable action within a reasonable time after learning of the dangerous condition.

36. Defendant breached the foregoing duties in numerous ways, including, but not limited to:

    a. Failing to reasonably inspect the visibly cracked and drooping branch;

    b. Failing to timely respond to and act upon neighbor complaints and warnings about the dangerous condition of the branch;

    c. Failing to contact or retain an arborist or other qualified professional to assess the dangerous condition of the branch after being alerted to that danger;

    d. Failing to remove, prune, or otherwise secure the branch despite the readily apparent risk that it could fall onto a public sidewalk used by pedestrians;

    e. Postponing action (“deal with it in the spring”) and failing to follow through before the foreseeable occurrence of ordinary summer storms; and

    f. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would under the same or similar circumstances.

37. The hazardous condition of the cracked and drooping limb existed for a substantial period of time before July 15, 2023. Under Massachusetts law, such a long‑standing, open, and obvious defect gives rise to constructive notice and a duty to act. See Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (liability where defect existed long enough that defendant should have discovered and remedied it); Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc., 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955) (constructive notice where condition existed for sufficient time).

38. Defendant’s failures were not reasonable under all of the circumstances and constitute negligence under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Schofield, 386 Mass. at 246–48 (negligence defined by failure to act as reasonable person under the circumstances).

39. Any contention that the incident was caused solely by weather is without merit. A landowner must take into account reasonably foreseeable weather conditions—such as ordinary summer thunderstorms—when assessing risk from dangerous trees and branches. See Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–07 (1978) (foreseeable weather conditions are part of circumstances to be considered in negligence analysis); cf. Kane v. Hartford, 98 Conn. 677, 682 (1923) (no “Act of God” defense where consequences of natural forces combined with defendant’s negligence).

40. The natural force of a typical summer storm interacting with a preexisting, negligently maintained, visibly cracked tree branch does not constitute a superseding or exculpatory cause as a matter of law. See Jesionek, 376 Mass. at 105–07 (intervening natural events do not break causation when foreseeable); Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37, 45–46 (2009) (foreseeable intervening causes do not relieve negligent party of liability).

41. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff’s harm was a reasonably foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, and remedy the hazardous tree branch overhanging a frequently used public sidewalk. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–22 (2002) (foreseeable risk and proximate cause under Massachusetts negligence law).

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:

    a. Bodily injuries, including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises;

    b. Past and future medical expenses, presently estimated at approximately $2,500, and subject to increase as may be proven at trial;

    c. Lost wages of approximately $600 for time missed from work;

    d. Pain and suffering;

    e. Physical impairment and discomfort;

    f. Emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience; and

    g. Other damages as may be established at trial.

43. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged comparative negligence on the part of Plaintiff, which is denied, was less than any negligence attributable to Defendant, and in any event does not bar recovery but may only proportionately diminish damages, if applicable.

44. Plaintiff is entitled to recover full and fair compensation for all of her injuries and losses, including interest and costs, under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C (pre‑ and post‑judgment interest).

                        V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Carter respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Reynolds, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury, but reasonably estimated to exceed $25,000, for:

   1. Past and future medical expenses, including but not limited to the approximately $2,500 already incurred;

   2. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including but not limited to the approximately $600 already lost;

   3. Pain and suffering;

   4. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life; and

   5. Any and all other damages recoverable under Massachusetts law;

B. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as provided by G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C;

C. Costs of this action as allowed by law;

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and equitable.

                           VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

                                           Respectfully submitted,  
                                           Plaintiff,  
                                           JESSICA CARTER  
                                           Pro Se
