COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(PHYSICAL CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, LAURA CHESTER (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Chester, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Samantha Chester (date of birth omitted here for privacy).

2. The Defendant, Michael Chester (“Father”), is an individual residing in or about Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Samantha Chester.

3. The parties are the parents and legal custodians of the minor child, Samantha Chester, age twelve (12).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody and parenting issues involving the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as applicable, and the prior custody judgment entered by this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 4 and G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the original custody order was issued by this Court and the child resides in this county.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about April 15, 2018, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment or Order (the “2018 Custody Order”) providing for shared legal custody and a 50/50 physical custody arrangement between the parties, with the parties alternating weeks (one week on/one week off).

7. At the time of the 2018 Custody Order, both parents lived relatively close to each other, were generally healthy, and each was able to safely and independently care for the minor child during his or her respective parenting time.

8. The 2018 Custody Order was based on the circumstances then existing and was found by the Court to be in the best interests of the minor child at that time, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the principles set forth in Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2018 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare, namely, the onset and progression of Father’s serious neurological condition and the resulting safety concerns for the minor child.

10. Recently, Father has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that substantially impairs his mobility, balance, and physical functioning.

11. As a result of this condition, Father has fallen multiple times in his home, including in circumstances where the minor child has been present or could have been present.

12. Father’s treating physician has advised Father that he should not be alone with the child near stairs or in situations requiring a quick physical response, due to the risk that Father will be unable to protect the child from harm or adequately respond in an emergency.

13. Father now regularly requires a wheelchair and/or other assistive devices and experiences difficulty performing basic physical tasks such as safely ascending and descending stairs, transferring in and out of bed or chairs, and moving quickly to respond to household emergencies or to the child’s physical needs.

14. Despite this medical advice, Father has insisted on continuing the exact same week-on/week-off 50/50 physical custody arrangement set forth in the 2018 Custody Order.

15. During Father’s parenting time, Father has relied upon the parties’ twelve-year-old daughter, Samantha, to assist him with physical tasks, including, but not limited to, helping him transfer from his wheelchair to his bed and bringing him objects or items that an adult caretaker would ordinarily provide.

16. The child has reported, and Mother is informed and believes, that the child feels responsible for Father’s physical safety and care during these periods and is placed in situations where she is expected to act as a caretaker for Father rather than being cared for as a child.

17. The minor child is twelve (12) years old and is not physically, emotionally, or developmentally equipped to serve as Father’s caregiver or to bear adult responsibilities associated with the management of a serious progressive medical condition.

18. The increased risk of falls, Father’s impaired ability to respond to emergencies, and Father’s reliance on the minor child for physical assistance create a serious and ongoing safety concern for the child and constitute a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s best interests.

19. The progression of Father’s neurological condition and the attendant limitations on his mobility and physical functioning were not anticipated at the time of the 2018 Custody Order and were not taken into account when that Order was entered.

20. The material change in Father’s health and functional abilities has directly and adversely affected the suitability and safety of the current 50/50 alternating-week physical custody arrangement, as it was initially structured when both parents were healthy and able to safely supervise the child.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

21. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–45 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996).

22. A modification of a custody order is appropriate where the moving party demonstrates (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981); Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 370–72 (1981) (articulating modification standard).

23. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a significant change in a parent’s health or functional capacity, where it affects parenting ability and the child’s safety or welfare, can constitute a material and substantial change warranting modification of custody or parenting time. See, e.g., Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405–06 (1981) (court may consider parent’s physical and mental health as it impacts best interests of child); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845–47 (material change and best interests standard).

24. The best-interests analysis is fact-specific and includes consideration of the child’s safety, emotional development, stability, and the ability of each parent to meet the child’s needs and provide appropriate care and supervision. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–47; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 226–27 (1998).

25. The current alternating-week 50/50 physical custody schedule no longer serves the child’s best interests in light of Father’s medical condition, his documented falls, the risks identified by his medical providers, and his reliance on the minor child for personal assistance.

26. The child’s emotional well-being is adversely affected by her perceived responsibility for Father’s physical safety and care. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96 (emotional well-being and psychological impact central to best-interests analysis); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 226–27.

27. The child has historically thrived in both homes, and Mother recognizes the importance of maintaining and nurturing the child’s relationship with Father. However, the child’s physical and emotional safety must take priority, consistent with the best-interests standard under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the case law cited above.

28. The requested modification does not seek to terminate the child’s relationship with Father or to eliminate his role as a parent. Instead, Mother seeks to adjust the schedule in a way that preserves Father–child contact while ensuring that the child is not placed in unsafe situations or asked to function as a caregiver for Father.

29. A parenting plan that designates Mother as the parent with primary physical custody, while affording Father reasonable, structured, and potentially supervised or otherwise supported parenting time, is necessary to protect the child’s safety and to promote her emotional stability and development.

30. Massachusetts law encourages arrangements that maintain the child’s relationship with both parents, so long as they are consistent with the child’s best interests and safety. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 709–11 (1985); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 190–91 (1998).

31. In light of Father’s progressive condition, the Court may craft an order that is flexible and subject to review, to account for further changes in Father’s health and ability to safely parent, consistent with the principles in G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the Court’s broad equitable powers. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. at 190–91; Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871–73 (2006).

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

32. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a prior judgment regarding the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children upon a showing of a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child, and upon a determination that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child.

33. The substantial change in Father’s medical condition and functional limitations, including repeated falls, medical advice restricting his ability to be alone with the child in certain situations, and his reliance on the child as a caregiver, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the relevant case law. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–47; Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 899–900; Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 405–06.

34. The Court’s authority to modify custody and parenting-time provisions extends to orders originally entered by agreement of the parties, if the change in circumstances and best-interests standard are satisfied. See Heistand v. Heistand, 384 Mass. 20, 26–28 (1981); Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 871–73.

35. The Court also has authority to impose conditions or safeguards on parenting time (including, where appropriate, requirements for supervision, the presence of another responsible adult, or limitations on overnights) as necessary to protect the child’s safety and welfare. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 208, § 31A (abuse-related protections by analogy in structuring safe parenting time); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–47; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. at 190–91.

36. In exercising its discretion, the Court may consider the child’s age and expressed preferences, to the extent appropriate, as part of the best-interests analysis, particularly where the child is of sufficient maturity, as here with a twelve-year-old child. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 226–27; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

37. Based upon the foregoing, modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary and appropriate to protect the minor child and to promote her best interests.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

38. Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2018 Custody Order to provide that:

   a. Mother shall have primary physical custody of the minor child, Samantha Chester;  

   b. The parties shall continue to share legal custody, provided that they are able to communicate effectively regarding the child’s educational, medical, and extracurricular needs and that shared legal custody remains in the child’s best interests;  

   c. Father shall have frequent and meaningful parenting time with the child, structured in a manner consistent with his medical limitations and the child’s safety, which may include:  

   &emsp;i. Daytime parenting time on specified days each week, in settings that minimize physical risk (for example, in a one-level environment without stairs, or at locations where another responsible adult is available if needed);  

   &emsp;ii. Overnights as and when Father is medically cleared and able to safely care for the child without relying upon the child for physical assistance, and where appropriate safeguards or supports are in place; and  

   &emsp;iii. Any additional reasonable parenting time as the parties may mutually agree in writing, so long as such time is consistent with the recommendations of Father’s medical providers and the child’s safety.  

39. Mother further requests that the Court order that:

   a. Father shall not place the child in a position where she is expected or asked to serve as his physical caretaker, including assisting with transfers or other tasks that present a risk of injury to the child or Father;  

   b. Father shall comply with medical advice regarding situations in which he should not be alone with the child (including, but not limited to, being alone with the child on or near stairs or in other high-risk settings), and shall ensure that a responsible adult is available in such situations if parenting time is to occur;  

   c. The parties shall exchange all relevant information regarding Father’s medical limitations that reasonably bear upon the child’s safety, consistent with privacy laws and any applicable protective orders, and may provide such information to the child’s school or counselors as needed; and  

   d. The parties shall cooperate to adjust the parenting-time schedule as may be reasonably necessary to accommodate changes in Father’s medical condition, the child’s school schedule, and the recommendations of qualified medical professionals, subject to further order of the Court if they cannot agree.

40. Mother further requests that the Court schedule this matter for a prompt case management conference and, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing in order to establish an appropriate, safe, and child-focused parenting plan.

41. Mother also requests that the Court award such further relief as it deems just and proper in the circumstances, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 215, § 6, including, but not limited to:

   a. Clarification of decision-making authority on medical issues affecting the child, if disputes arise;  

   b. Appointment of a guardian ad litem, probation officer, or other neutral professional to investigate and report to the Court regarding the child’s best interests, if the Court finds such appointment appropriate; and  

   c. Any additional safeguards or conditions on parenting time deemed necessary to protect the child’s safety and emotional well-being.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Chester, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2018 custody order, specifically relating to the Father’s progressive neurological condition, functional limitations, and the resulting impact on the child’s safety and welfare;

2. Determine that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Samantha Chester, that the existing 50/50 alternating-week physical custody arrangement be modified;

3. Enter a modified judgment providing that:

   a. Mother, Laura Chester, shall have primary physical custody of the minor child;  

   b. The parties shall share legal custody, subject to further order of the Court if shared legal custody ceases to be in the child’s best interests; and  

   c. Father, Michael Chester, shall have reasonable and liberal parenting time with the minor child, structured and conditioned as the Court deems appropriate to ensure the child’s physical safety and emotional well-being, including limitations to prevent the child from being placed in a caregiving role for Father or in unsafe physical situations;

4. Order that Father comply with relevant medical recommendations concerning his ability to be alone with the child in higher-risk physical environments, and that he not rely upon the child for physical assistance or personal care tasks that are unsafe or inappropriate for a child of her age;

5. Schedule this matter for further conference and/or evidentiary hearing as necessary to determine an appropriate, detailed parenting plan consistent with these principles;

6. Award Mother such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the child.

Respectfully submitted,

LAURA CHESTER,  
By herself, pro se
