CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Premises”). Plaintiff’s telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Linda Martinez (“Defendant”) is an individual who, on information and belief, owns, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851, including the Premises rented by Plaintiff.

3. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises, located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises since that date and, at all times relevant, has paid monthly rent of $1,200.

4. This is an action for breach of the statutory and common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment arising from conditions at the Premises, including persistent mold growth in the bathroom and Defendant’s failure to properly remediate and correct defective conditions materially affecting Plaintiff’s health, safety, and use and enjoyment of the Premises.

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as this is a civil action for damages arising out of a residential tenancy located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Lowell District Court and the amount in controversy is within the Court’s jurisdictional limits.

6. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court because the Premises are located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–6 as if fully set forth herein.

8. Plaintiff has rented and occupied the Premises from Defendant since on or about May 1, 2022, under a residential tenancy agreement for a monthly rent of $1,200.

9. The Premises include a bathroom with an enclosed shower, a ceiling, and a mechanical exhaust fan. The bathroom does not have a window and relies on the exhaust fan to ventilate moisture from showers and normal bathroom use.

10. In or about 2025 (date more specifically known to Defendant), Plaintiff observed mold growth developing in the shower area of the bathroom, initially appearing in the corner of the shower and then spreading upward and outward along the bathroom ceiling.

11. Over time, the mold growth became visibly extensive, spreading across a significant portion of the bathroom ceiling and surfaces adjacent to the shower area.

12. Plaintiff uses the bathroom in an ordinary, reasonable, and foreseeable manner, including taking daily showers. Plaintiff runs the exhaust fan when showering, although, as with many tenants, she may not have run it during every single shower. Her showers are of ordinary duration and temperature and are not unusual in comparison to normal residential use.

13. Plaintiff is not a building professional, contractor, or ventilation expert, and she reasonably relies on Defendant, as landlord, to provide a structurally sound and adequately ventilated bathroom that can handle typical shower use without developing hazardous mold conditions.

14. Upon noticing the mold growth, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the condition. Defendant thereafter came to the Premises and personally inspected the mold in the bathroom.

15. Instead of arranging for professional remediation or investigating structural deficiencies, Defendant blamed Plaintiff for the mold, stating that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and took showers that were “too hot and too long.”

16. Defendant stated that she would only “clean” the existing mold, and refused to take any steps to address the underlying ventilation or structural issues contributing to the recurring moisture and mold condition in the bathroom.

17. Defendant has refused to install or improve ventilation, repair or replace the exhaust fan, treat or replace contaminated building materials, or otherwise ensure that the bathroom is reasonably safe and habitable and free from persistent mold growth.

18. Since the appearance and progression of mold in the bathroom, Plaintiff has developed respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which she had not experienced prior to the mold condition at the Premises.

19. Plaintiff sought medical attention, and her treating physician indicated that the respiratory symptoms were consistent with exposure to mold and advised Plaintiff that the mold should be remediated.

20. As a direct result of the mold contamination, Plaintiff has been forced to discard personal property that became moldy, including at least one shower curtain and towels, with a total approximate replacement cost of $60.

21. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure and refusal to properly remediate the condition or address the underlying cause have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her bathroom and the Premises as a whole.

22. Plaintiff has been forced to limit her use of the bathroom, suffer unpleasant and unhealthy living conditions, and endure anxiety and concern about the effect of continued mold exposure on her health.

23. The mold growth and related moisture condition constitute violations of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to the requirements that a dwelling be maintained in a sanitary and safe condition, free from chronic dampness and mold, with adequate ventilation in bathrooms. See 105 C.M.R. 410.020, 410.500, 410.750.

24. The mold condition also renders the Premises unfit for human habitation and in violation of the implied warranty of habitability, as recognized by the Supreme Judicial Court in Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and its progeny.

25. Plaintiff has at all relevant times acted reasonably, used the Premises in a normal residential manner, and complied with her obligations as a tenant, including regularly paying rent.

26. Defendant, by contrast, has failed to take reasonable steps to investigate and correct the hazardous mold and moisture condition, despite having actual notice of the problem and its adverse impact on Plaintiff’s health and enjoyment of the Premises.

27. Defendant’s refusal to address the ventilation or other building defects and her insistence that Plaintiff alone is to blame for the mold constitute an unreasonable and unlawful response to a serious, ongoing housing‑code‑related defect.

28. The presence of mold and moisture, and Defendant’s failure to abate the condition after notice, has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered harm, including but not limited to: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; (b) physical symptoms and health concerns related to mold exposure; (c) property damage in at least the amount of $60; and (d) inconvenience, distress, and loss of the benefit of her bargain under the tenancy.

30. Plaintiff believes that she is entitled to at least $500 in damages as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in addition to any multiple damages and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs mandated by statute.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

31. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is prohibited from “directly or indirectly interfering with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee,” where such interference is caused by the landlord or persons acting on the landlord’s behalf.

33. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of a dwelling due to housing‑code violations, defective conditions, or failure to make necessary repairs can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  

   a. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–19 (1977) (landlord liable for quiet enjoyment breach where landlord’s actions or inactions set in motion forces substantially interfering with tenant’s use);  

   b. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994) (serious defects and housing authority’s failure to act supported tenant’s quiet enjoyment claim);  

   c. Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–53 (1997) (landlord’s failure to cure known defective conditions can constitute interference under G.L. c. 186, § 14);  

   d. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982) (persistent flooding and moisture conditions that landlord failed to remedy violated quiet enjoyment).

34. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment supplements the common‑law covenant recognized in cases such as Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929), and guarantees tenants the right to freedom from serious and repeated interferences with their tenancy caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions.

35. Here, the persistent mold growth, moisture, and inadequate ventilation in Plaintiff’s bathroom constitute a serious defective condition within the Premises that interferes with Plaintiff’s health, safety, and ability to use the bathroom and the Premises for their intended residential purpose.

36. The mold condition is closely tied to violations of state and local health and sanitary codes, including 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., which mandate that dwellings be kept in good repair, in a sanitary condition, and free from chronic dampness and related health hazards.

37. Violations of the State Sanitary Code are evidence of breaches of both the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973) (sanitary code violations render premises uninhabitable); Hemingway v. Bresky, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 186–87 (1983) (sanitary code violations support quiet enjoyment damages); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 400–01 (1982) (failure to correct code violations can constitute quiet enjoyment breach).

38. Defendant had actual notice of the mold and moisture condition. Plaintiff reported and showed the condition to Defendant, and Defendant personally inspected the mold in the bathroom.

39. Despite this actual notice and the serious nature of the condition, Defendant refused to take reasonable and necessary steps to investigate and permanently correct the problem, including repair or replacement of ventilation equipment, remediation of mold‑contaminated materials, and correction of underlying structural or moisture issues.

40. Instead, Defendant unreasonably blamed Plaintiff’s ordinary bathroom usage, refused to address the root cause, and limited any response to superficial “cleaning” of visible mold, which is inadequate to cure mold contamination and prevent recurrence.

41. A landlord’s failure, after notice, to remedy conditions that violate the sanitary code or materially impair health or safety has been held to constitute indirect interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284–85; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–05; Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. at 400–01.

42. The interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy resulting from Defendant’s inaction is both substantial and unreasonable. Plaintiff has experienced recurring mold exposure, respiratory symptoms, loss of personal property, fear and anxiety regarding her health, and diminished use of the bathroom and Premises.

43. The interference is “substantial” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts case law because it materially impairs Plaintiff’s ability to safely and comfortably occupy the Premises as a home. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (standard is substantial interference with “use and enjoyment” of leased premises).

44. Defendant’s failure to act is particularly unreasonable given that: (a) the bathroom has no window and relies solely on mechanical ventilation; (b) Defendant is in a superior position to address ventilation, structural, and mold‑remediation issues; and (c) Plaintiff, as a residential tenant, is not capable or responsible under the law for undertaking major remediation or ventilation modifications.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may be liable where the interference is “direct or indirect” and need not personally intend the interference, so long as the landlord’s conduct or omission sets in motion the circumstances causing the interference. Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–19.

46. By neglecting to correct the mold and underlying causes after notice, and by choosing instead to blame Plaintiff and do nothing meaningful to remediate, Defendant has indirectly and unlawfully interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

47. Massachusetts appellate decisions confirm that conditions such as chronic dampness, leaks, and associated mold and health problems, when uncorrected by a landlord after notice, can sustain a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–05 (persistent water infiltration); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. at 400–01 (failure to remedy serious conditions); Hemingway v. Bresky, 15 Mass. App. Ct. at 186–87 (sanitary code violations and inaction).

48. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff to suffer actual and consequential damages, including, without limitation:  

   a. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises due to unsafe, unsanitary conditions;  
   b. Physical health effects, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing consistent with mold exposure;  
   c. Loss of personal property, including at least $60 in discarded shower curtains and towels damaged by mold;  
   d. Inconvenience, discomfort, and distress associated with living in a mold‑contaminated environment and the risk of worsening respiratory problems; and  
   e. Loss of use and enjoyment of the bathroom and Premises.

49. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs of the action and reasonable attorney’s fees. See, e.g., Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979) (discussing multiple‑damage remedy and mandatory attorney’s fee provision of § 14).

50. Three months’ rent at the Premises is $3,600 (3 x $1,200). Accordingly, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover not less than $3,600, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, or such other amount as the Court finds appropriate based on the evidence and applicable law. Plaintiff presently estimates her actual damages at not less than $500, but she seeks the statutory minimum three months’ rent as mandated by statute, in addition to her actual consequential losses.

51. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is continuing in nature to the extent that the mold condition, inadequate ventilation, and related interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises persist.

52. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement or amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence as additional facts and damages are established in discovery and at trial.

B. An award of damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than the statutory minimum of three (3) months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, which, based on Plaintiff’s monthly rent of $1,200, shall be no less than $3,600, together with Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to health‑related harm, property damage, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;

JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
