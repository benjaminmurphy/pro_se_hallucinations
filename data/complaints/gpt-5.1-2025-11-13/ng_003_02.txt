Plaintiff,  

v.  

**HOMEGOODS SUPERSTORE, LLC,**  
Defendant.  

____________________________________/

### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
(Jury Trial Demanded)


Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant HomeGoods Superstore, LLC (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, at all relevant times, was a lawful business invitee on the premises described below.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant HomeGoods Superstore, LLC is a foreign or domestic limited liability company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, leased, operated, managed, and/or controlled a retail store located at 1202 Westford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Store”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted by and through its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, and/or servants, all of whom were acting within the course and scope of their employment, agency, and/or actual or apparent authority.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action sounding in negligence arising out of bodily injuries sustained by Plaintiff on September 15, 2023, at Defendant’s Store in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, such that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court, Lowell Division, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County, and the Store where the incident occurred is located at 1202 Westford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff lawfully entered Defendant’s Store as a customer and business invitee to browse and potentially purchase household goods, including kitchen items.

8. Plaintiff was exercising due care for her own safety while walking in an aisle displaying kitchen appliances and related merchandise.

9. In that aisle, Defendant and/or its employees had stacked multiple heavy boxes of small kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens, on elevated shelves to a height of approximately five or six boxes.

10. These heavy boxes were stacked vertically and precariously without adequate straps, rails, guards, stops, lips, netting, or other physical barriers, and without being otherwise secured or stabilized to prevent falling.

11. The stacking of multiple heavy boxes to such a height on open shelving, without appropriate restraints or safety measures, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk that one or more boxes would become dislodged and fall onto customers below.

12. The hazard posed by the unsecured, high-stacked boxes was open and obvious to Defendant and/or its employees, or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have been discovered and remedied by Defendant prior to Plaintiff’s injury.

13. At approximately the time of the incident, another customer was pushing a standard shopping cart down the same aisle where Plaintiff was standing and examining merchandise.

14. The other customer’s cart made a normal, modest contact with a lower portion of the shelving—an ordinary occurrence foreseeable to any reasonable store operator in a self-service retail environment.

15. Upon that modest contact, at least one large, heavy toaster-oven box from near the top of the stack became dislodged and fell from an elevated shelf, striking Plaintiff on her right shoulder and the side of her head.

16. The fact that a routine, minor bump to the lower shelf caused an elevated heavy box to fall demonstrates that the shelving and merchandise were negligently and unsafely arranged and maintained.

17. Immediately after being struck, Plaintiff experienced dizziness, pain in her shoulder, and a significant headache, and was visibly shaken and distressed.

18. Defendant’s store manager and/or other employees responded, documented the incident in an “incident report,” and offered Plaintiff a store coupon, but did not call emergency medical services for Plaintiff or suggest that she seek urgent medical evaluation for a likely head injury.

19. Plaintiff left the Store and, as the evening progressed, her symptoms—including dizziness, headache, and shoulder pain—worsened.

20. Later that night, Plaintiff sought emergency medical care at a local hospital emergency department.

21. At the emergency room, Plaintiff reported being struck on the head and shoulder by a falling box, and medical personnel evaluated and treated her.

22. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

23. Plaintiff was advised to rest, limit activity, and refrain from driving and strenuous physical exertion until her symptoms improved.

24. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed as a delivery driver and, as a result of her injuries and medical restrictions, was unable to work for several days.

25. Plaintiff also was unable to participate in her regular weekly soccer league for approximately one month, an activity that had previously been a significant source of recreation and enjoyment.

26. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of her concussion and shoulder strain, including emergency room care and follow-up treatment.

27. Plaintiff lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to work she missed as a direct and proximate result of her injuries.

28. Plaintiff additionally suffered pain, discomfort, and headaches; limitations in using her shoulder; interference with sleep and ordinary activities of daily life; and emotional distress and anxiety related to the incident and her symptoms.

29. All of Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence in the ownership, operation, management, and maintenance of its Store and premises.

## IV. DUTY OF CARE AND APPLICABLE LAW

30. As the owner and/or operator of a retail premises open to the public, Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to maintain the Store and its aisles, shelving, and merchandise in a reasonably safe condition and to protect her from foreseeable risks of harm. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowners owe reasonable care to lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995).

31. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is negligent if it fails to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000).

32. A store owner has a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition in light of the circumstances, including the nature of its business, the arrangement of its merchandise, and the foreseeable behavior of its customers. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–83 (2007); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 377–78 (2010).

33. This duty includes, inter alia, the duty to (a) arrange and stack merchandise in a reasonably safe manner; (b) avoid creating unreasonable hazards; (c) inspect the premises with reasonable frequency; and (d) remedy or adequately guard against known or reasonably discoverable dangers. See *Bowers v. P. Wile’s, Inc.*, 454 Mass. 361, 365–66 (2009); *Thorell v. ADAP, Inc.*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 145–46 (2015).

34. A store owner is liable for the foreseeable consequences of its methods of operation and merchandising when those methods create a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to customers. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 786–87 (adopting “mode of operation” approach); *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.*, 332 Mass. 560, 562–63 (1955).

35. Defendant’s stacking of multiple heavy boxes on high shelves in an unsecured fashion, in an aisle used by customers with shopping carts, constituted a dangerous condition created by Defendant’s own method of operation, for which Defendant may be found negligent without proof of actual or constructive notice of a specific falling box. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 786–87.

36. A defendant is liable where its negligent acts or omissions are a substantial contributing cause of the plaintiff’s injuries and those harms were a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s conduct. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147; *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1987).

37. Massachusetts statutes also require a person or entity to exercise reasonable care so as not to inflict injury on others. See, e.g., G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence); G.L. c. 231, § 60D (liability for personal injuries not limited absent statutory provision); and G.L. c. 93A, § 2 (prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts; cited for background of consumer protection duties, though Plaintiff does not assert a G.L. c. 93A claim here).

---

## V. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

38. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 37 as if fully set forth herein.

39. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, maintenance, operation, and control of the Store so as to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect Plaintiff against unreasonable risks of physical harm. See *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 707; *Davis*, 420 Mass. at 743.

40. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care, including but not limited to the following negligent acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to safely arrange, stack, and secure heavy merchandise on elevated shelves so as to prevent foreseeable falling hazards;

   b. Stacking multiple heavy boxes of appliances to an excessive and unsafe height without adequate restraints, rails, guards, netting, or other devices to prevent dislodgment;

   c. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable store policies and procedures regarding the safe stocking and storage of heavy, boxed merchandise on high shelving;

   d. Failing to inspect and monitor the aisle and shelving where Plaintiff was injured with sufficient frequency and care to identify and correct the dangerous stacking condition;

   e. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the risk posed by unsecured, high-stacked heavy boxes;

   f. Failing to reasonably foresee that customers using shopping carts in narrow aisles would, in the ordinary course, bump shelving, and that such bumps could dislodge improperly stacked merchandise;

   g. Failing to train and supervise Defendant’s employees adequately with respect to safe merchandising and stocking practices; and

   h. Otherwise failing to use reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent foreseeable harm to Plaintiff.

41. The hazardous condition that caused Plaintiff’s injuries—the unsecured stacking of heavy boxes on high shelves in a customer aisle—was created, authorized, or allowed by Defendant and/or its employees in the course of Defendant’s business operations and was not caused by Plaintiff or any third party outside Defendant’s control.

42. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that (a) customers with carts would routinely traverse the aisle; (b) minor contact between carts and shelving could occur; and (c) if heavy boxes were stacked high and unsecured, such contact could cause boxes to fall and injure customers standing below.

43. Defendant either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the dangerous condition created by its own stocking practices and should have taken steps to correct it or protect customers from it. See *Bowers*, 454 Mass. at 365–66; *Thorell*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 145–46.

44. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff being struck by the falling toaster-oven box and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147; *Glidden*, 430 Mass. at 697.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including but not limited to:

   a. A mild concussion;  
   b. A shoulder strain; and  
   c. Associated pain, discomfort, and physical limitations.

46. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur expenses and losses, including but not limited to:

   a. Past medical expenses of approximately $2,500 for emergency room treatment, diagnostic testing, medication, and follow-up care, and the likelihood of reasonable future medical expenses;  

   b. Past lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to Plaintiff’s inability to work for several days following the incident, and potential future lost earnings or diminished earning capacity to the extent her injuries have any lasting impact;  

   c. Pain and suffering, both physical and mental, including headaches, dizziness, shoulder pain, and related discomfort;  

   d. Loss of enjoyment of life, including inability to participate in her weekly soccer league for approximately one month and limitations on other recreational and social activities; and  

   e. Emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience associated with the incident, the medical treatment, and the disruption of her daily life.

47. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on any damages awarded from the date this action is commenced.

48. To the extent, if any, that Plaintiff is alleged to have been comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies any such negligence; however, should the trier of fact assign a percentage of fault to Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s damages should be diminished, but not barred, in accordance with G.L. c. 231, § 85, as long as Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than the total negligence of the Defendant.

49. No negligence by any third party supersedes or breaks the chain of causation between Defendant’s negligence and Plaintiff’s injuries, and any such negligence, if found, was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant under the circumstances. See *Glick*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. at 902.
