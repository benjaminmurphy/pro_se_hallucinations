COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PROPERTY DAMAGE)  

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Dorsey (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Mark Dorsey is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and is Plaintiff’s neighbor in a duplex property sharing a common driveway.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action sounding in negligence for property damage occurring in Hampden County, Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, thereby conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Hampden County under G.L. c. 223, § 1 and G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the causes of action arose in Hampden County and the parties reside there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a duplex located at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway running adjacent to a wooden fence.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder (the “Ladder”).

8. For a substantial period prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant regularly stored and left the Ladder leaning upright against the wooden fence immediately adjacent to the shared driveway and in close proximity to the area where Plaintiff parked her vehicle.

9. The Ladder was not tied down, secured, or otherwise stabilized; it simply rested against the fence in an upright or near-upright position.

10. Plaintiff customarily parked her motor vehicle in the driveway space directly next to the fence where the Ladder was kept.

11. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff specifically expressed concerns to Defendant about the Ladder’s stability and the risk that it might fall, particularly during windy conditions, and damage her vehicle.

12. Plaintiff informed Defendant that she was worried the Ladder might topple over onto her car and asked that he either tie it down or move it to a safer location.

13. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and represented to Plaintiff that he would tie the Ladder down or move it, but he failed to do so.

14. Defendant, despite this notice and his assurances, continued to store the Ladder leaning unsecured against the fence near Plaintiff’s parking area.

15. On or about March 15, 2023, a windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, Plaintiff arrived home and began backing her vehicle into the shared driveway, intending to park in her usual space next to the fence.

16. As Plaintiff was backing into the driveway, a gust of wind caused the unsecured Ladder to fall away from the fence and into the driveway.

17. The Ladder violently struck Plaintiff’s vehicle, crashing onto the hood and windshield.

18. As a direct result of the Ladder’s impact, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained significant physical damage, including but not limited to dents to the hood and a cracked windshield.

19. Although the vehicle remained operable, the damage required professional bodywork and replacement of the windshield.

20. Plaintiff promptly arranged for the necessary repairs, which required the vehicle to be in a repair shop for more than one week.

21. Because her vehicle was unavailable during repairs, Plaintiff reasonably incurred costs to rent a replacement vehicle to maintain her daily transportation.

22. Plaintiff was required to pay her automobile insurance deductible out-of-pocket to have the repairs performed.

23. Plaintiff also incurred rental car expenses out-of-pocket in order to have transportation while her vehicle was in the shop.

24. Plaintiff did not suffer physical bodily injury or incur medical expenses or wage loss but sustained economic losses in the form of property damage to her vehicle and consequential rental car and deductible expenses.

25. At all relevant times, Plaintiff used the shared driveway in a normal, lawful, and foreseeable manner and had no role in placing, storing, or controlling the Ladder.

26. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against a fence immediately adjacent to a driveway used for vehicle parking created an unreasonable risk that the Ladder could fall and damage vehicles or otherwise cause injury.

27. Defendant knew or should have known that weather in Springfield in March often includes windy conditions capable of toppling unsecured objects such as a tall, lightweight aluminum extension ladder.

28. Defendant had actual notice of the specific risk that the Ladder might fall and damage Plaintiff’s vehicle because Plaintiff clearly communicated that concern to him on more than one occasion before the incident.

29. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable precautions, such as tying the Ladder down, storing it horizontally on the ground or in a garage, or moving it to a location where it could not fall onto vehicles in the driveway.

30. Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the Ladder, after being specifically warned of the danger, was unreasonable and careless.

31. The Ladder’s fall and the resulting damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle were the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the Ladder from toppling.

32. There was no superseding or intervening cause of the incident; the wind and Plaintiff’s ordinary use of the driveway were foreseeable conditions that Defendant was obligated to take into account in exercising reasonable care.

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered property damage to her vehicle, incurred her insurance deductible, and incurred rental vehicle expenses, together with associated inconvenience and loss of use of her vehicle.

34. Plaintiff estimates that her aggregate damages, including repair costs, deductible, and rental vehicle expenses, exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and reserves the right to amend this Complaint as further information becomes available.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**NEGLIGENCE (PROPERTY DAMAGE)**

35. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 above as if fully set forth herein.

36. Under Massachusetts law, a person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others and their property. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–150 (2006) (duty to exercise reasonable care in securing dangerous instrumentalities); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995) (general duty of reasonable care).

37. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, storage, and control of his personal property—including the Ladder—on and near the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff or her property. See Remy v. MacDonald, 440 Mass. 675, 677–78 (2004) (duty arises from reasonable foreseeability of harm); Luoni v. Berube, 431 Mass. 729, 731–32 (2000) (duty of reasonable care under all the circumstances of the case).

38. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty, as a neighbor and co-occupant of the premises sharing a common driveway, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining conditions immediately adjacent to the shared driveway in a reasonably safe condition for foreseeable use by Plaintiff. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 153–54 (2013) (duty based on control and foreseeability of harm); Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowner/occupant owes lawful visitors a duty of reasonable care in all the circumstances).

39. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to properly secure the Ladder so that it could not be easily toppled by wind or other foreseeable forces;

   b. Failing to move or store the Ladder in a safer location away from the driveway and Plaintiff’s normal parking area;

   c. Failing to tie down, fasten, or otherwise stabilize the Ladder despite its height, light weight, and proximity to an active driveway;

   d. Failing to heed Plaintiff’s repeated warnings and concerns regarding the risk that the Ladder might fall and damage her vehicle;

   e. Failing to timely correct a known hazardous condition that Defendant created and controlled;

   f. Failing to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the same or similar circumstances.

40. The question of whether Defendant’s conduct meets the standard of reasonable care is one for the fact-finder. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 56–57 (1983) (standard of reasonable care under all circumstances); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (negligence requires duty, breach, causation, damages).

41. Harm to Plaintiff’s vehicle from the Ladder falling was reasonably foreseeable. Plaintiff’s prior complaints about the Ladder falling on her car provided Defendant with actual notice of the specific risk. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 149–50 (foreseeability of criminal use of firearm where owner failed to secure it); Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (foreseeability and scope of duty).

42. Defendant’s breach of his duty directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s damages. “Proximate cause” under Massachusetts law requires that the harm be a foreseeable result of the negligent conduct. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002) (proximate cause and foreseeability); Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).

43. But for Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the Ladder, the Ladder would not have toppled onto Plaintiff’s vehicle on March 15, 2023, and Plaintiff’s property would not have been damaged. The incident and resulting damages were the natural and probable consequences of Defendant’s negligence.

44. Plaintiff was at all relevant times acting lawfully and using the driveway in a normal and foreseeable manner. Plaintiff did not contribute to the creation of the hazardous condition, had no control over the Ladder, and reasonably relied on Defendant’s assurances that he would address the danger. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence; plaintiff’s recovery diminished only to extent of contributory fault, if any).

45. Defendant’s negligence resulted in damage to Plaintiff’s personal property (her motor vehicle), including but not limited to physical damage to the hood and windshield, loss of use of the vehicle, and consequential rental car and deductible expenses. Massachusetts law permits recovery for property damage and consequential economic loss caused by negligence. See FMR Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., 415 Mass. 393, 395–96 (1993) (negligence action for property damage and related loss); Black v. Coastal Oil New England, Inc., 45 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 462–63 (1998) (recovery of cost of repairs and related losses).

46. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff in a property damage negligence action may recover the reasonable cost of repairs and other reasonably necessary and foreseeable consequential expenses. See Schleissner v. Provincetown, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 834, 835–36 (1991) (cost of reasonable repairs is appropriate measure of damages for property damage); Trinity Church in the City of Boston v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 399 Mass. 43, 48–49 (1987) (damages should place plaintiff as nearly as possible in position she would have been in absent negligence).

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages, among others:

   a. The cost of repairing the physical damage to her vehicle, including replacement of the cracked windshield and repair of the dented hood;

   b. The payment of her automobile insurance deductible out-of-pocket;

   c. Rental car expenses incurred while her vehicle was in the repair shop for over one week;

   d. Loss of use of her vehicle during the repair period; and

   e. The time, inconvenience, and disruption associated with arranging repairs and substitute transportation.

48. Plaintiff did not incur medical expenses or wage loss, but her economic damages from property damage and related consequential losses are substantial, and she seeks full compensation as allowed by law.

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, Plaintiff is also entitled to prejudgment interest on her damages from the date of commencement of this action.
