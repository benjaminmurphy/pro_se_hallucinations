Although the court remands because of a factual dispute over whether the doctor was acting within the scope of his BMA employment at the precise time of treatment, it clearly affirms that an employer is vicariously liable for its employees\u2019 torts committed in the scope of employment, which matches the proposition\u2019s statement of respondeat superior liability through officers, employees, and agents. The case is thus good authority for the general proposition of vicarious liability, contingent on proof of scope of employment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "To prevail against BMA, the plaintiffs need only establish that (1) at the time of the alleged negligence Dr. Schlitzer was an employee of BMA, and (2) the alleged negligent treatment of the plaintiff occurred within the scope of Dr. Schlitzer\u2019s employment by BMA. Once employment is established, the only remaining issue is whether he was working for BMA at the time of the alleged negligent treatment, i.e., whether his treatment of the plaintiff was within the scope of his employment by BMA. This comports with traditional agency law that \u2018[a]n employer is liable for torts committed by employees while acting in the scope of their employment.\u2019"
