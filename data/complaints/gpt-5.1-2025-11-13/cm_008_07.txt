COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time judgment, respectfully states as follows:

1. **Parties and Jurisdiction**

   1. The Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Reed (“Emily”), age 10.

   2. The Defendant, Michael Reed (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

   3. This action concerns the custody and parenting time arrangements for the minor child, Emily, who has resided in Massachusetts for more than six months prior to the filing of this Complaint.

   4. The Bristol County Probate and Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, G.L. c. 209, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as well as continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting orders relating to the minor child.

   5. This Court previously entered a Judgment (or Judgment of Divorce/Order of Custody, as applicable) dated March 15, 2021 (the “Judgment”), which established the current custody and parenting time orders for Emily.

2. **Existing Judgment and Custody Arrangement**

   6. Under the March 15, 2021 Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody of Emily.

   7. Under that Judgment, Mother is designated as the primary residential parent of Emily.

   8. Under that Judgment, Father has substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sunday nights leading into the school week.

   9. The Judgment further provides that the parties are to cooperate on school matters, to keep each other informed about Emily’s education, and to make joint decisions in the exercise of their shared legal custody.

   10. At the time the Judgment was entered, Emily was doing well in school, with satisfactory attendance, grades, and test scores, and there were no significant concerns regarding school absenteeism or truancy.

3. **Material Change in Circumstances**

   11. Since the entry of the March 15, 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances as that term is used in Massachusetts law governing custody modifications. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

   12. Over the past year, during Father’s weekend parenting time, Father has repeatedly and consistently kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekend, stating that she “needs a mental health day.”

   13. These Monday absences have not been based on any diagnosed medical condition, nor supported by any doctor’s notes or other medical documentation.

   14. As a result of these repeated Monday absences, the school has issued truancy or attendance warnings regarding Emily.

   15. Over the same period, Emily’s academic performance has declined, as reflected in lower grades, falling test scores, and concerns expressed by the school.

   16. Father has also regularly refused or failed to bring Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions that fall during his weekend parenting time, despite the fact that such tutoring was arranged to support Emily’s educational progress.

   17. Father’s pattern of keeping Emily out of school and failing to cooperate with tutoring directly contradicts the parties’ obligation to cooperate on school matters and to act in Emily’s best educational interests.

   18. The resulting pattern of absenteeism and missed educational support has had a detrimental impact on Emily’s academic performance and risks further educational harm if not addressed.

   19. Father’s conduct reflects a breakdown in the joint legal custody arrangement with respect to educational decision-making, in that the parties can no longer effectively share decision-making authority regarding school attendance and related educational supports. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

   20. The circumstances described herein were not contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the March 15, 2021 Judgment and constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances warranting modification under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

4. **Best Interests of the Child**

   21. In any modification of a custody or parenting order, the paramount consideration is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

   22. Massachusetts law recognizes that stable and consistent school attendance and appropriate educational support are integral to a child’s best interests and overall welfare. See *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Petition of the Dept. of Social Servs.*, 397 Mass. 659 (1986).

   23. The current pattern of Emily’s absences on Mondays following Father’s parenting time undermines Emily’s educational stability, causes her to fall behind academically, and exposes her to further truancy consequences.

   24. Father’s refusal or failure to bring Emily to tutoring during his weekends further deprives Emily of necessary academic support at a time when she is already struggling.

   25. The parties’ inability to agree on and consistently implement decisions relating to Emily’s school attendance and tutoring demonstrates that joint legal custody with equal decision-making authority regarding education is no longer workable or in Emily’s best interests. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

   26. Modification of the Judgment to adjust legal custody as it relates to educational decisions, and/or to adjust Father’s Sunday-night/school-night parenting time, is necessary to protect Emily’s educational well-being and to serve her best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

5. **Legal Standard for Modification**

   27. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Probate and Family Court may modify custody and parenting provisions of a judgment when the moving party demonstrates (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

   28. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently applied this standard in custody and parenting time modifications, requiring that a prior judgment be altered when circumstances have changed so significantly that adherence to the existing order would no longer promote the child’s best interests. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Herbst v. Herbst*, 2007 Mass. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1038.

   29. Where joint legal custody is no longer feasible because the parents cannot communicate or cooperate effectively regarding important matters affecting the child—such as education—courts may modify the judgment to allocate final decision-making authority to one parent or to alter physical custody/parenting time in a manner that serves the child’s best interests. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

   30. The facts set forth above satisfy these standards: Father’s pattern of unjustified school absences for Emily, coupled with his refusal to bring her to tutoring and the resulting academic decline, constitutes a material change in circumstances and demonstrates that modification is required to protect Emily’s best interests.

6. **Requested Modification**

   31. Mother does not seek to interfere with Emily’s meaningful relationship with Father; rather, she seeks a narrowly tailored modification to address the specific educational harms that have arisen under the current order.

   32. To address the identified problems, Mother requests that the Court modify the March 15, 2021 Judgment as follows:

      a. **Educational Decision-Making / Legal Custody (Targeted):**  
         That the Court modify the joint legal custody provisions to grant Mother final decision-making authority with respect to Emily’s education, including but not limited to: school attendance, responses to truancy warnings, tutoring and academic supports, special education/504 plans if any, and other school-related services. Father shall retain the right to access all school records, to communicate with the school, and to be consulted in good faith by Mother on major educational decisions, but if the parties cannot agree, Mother’s decision shall be final.

      or, in the alternative and/or in addition:

      b. **Sunday Night / School-Night Parenting Time:**  
         That the Court modify Father’s parenting schedule so that Father’s regular weekend parenting time ends on Sunday at a time sufficiently early to ensure Emily’s preparation and attendance for school on Monday (for example, Sunday at 5:00 p.m.), with Sunday overnights to be with Mother unless otherwise agreed in writing, and that Father shall not withhold Emily from school on Mondays absent a bona fide illness supported by appropriate notice to Mother and, when reasonably available, medical documentation.

      c. **Tutoring and Educational Support Compliance:**  
         That the Court order that both parties shall ensure Emily’s attendance at all mutually agreed-upon or court-ordered tutoring sessions, academic support programs, or educational interventions, including those scheduled during Father’s parenting time, unless the parties agree in writing to a change in schedule or the session is cancelled by the provider.

      d. **Cooperation with School:**  
         That the Court order both parties to cooperate with Emily’s school regarding attendance and academic support, to respond promptly to school communications, and to comply with any reasonable school-based plans to address Emily’s attendance and academic performance.

      e. **Further Orders as Necessary:**  
         That the Court enter such further orders as may be necessary to effectuate these modifications and to protect Emily’s educational welfare and best interests.

   33. The above-requested relief is specifically tailored to remedy the harm that has developed since the entry of the March 15, 2021 Judgment, respects Father’s role in Emily’s life, and places primary responsibility for educational decision-making and Monday school attendance with Mother so as to safeguard Emily’s academic stability.

7. **No Pending Inconsistent Proceedings**

   34. Upon information and belief, no other action or proceeding concerning the custody of Emily is presently pending in any other court, and no prior proceeding has been commenced that would conflict with the relief requested herein.

8. **Prayer for Relief**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the March 15, 2021 Judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law;

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily;

C. Modify the March 15, 2021 Judgment to grant Mother final decision-making authority regarding Emily’s education, including school attendance and educational supports, while preserving Father’s right to access information and be consulted, as set forth above;

D. Alternatively, and/or in addition, modify Father’s parenting schedule so that his regular weekend parenting time ends on Sunday at a time that ensures Emily’s readiness for school on Monday, with Sunday overnights to be with Mother unless otherwise agreed, and require that Emily not be kept out of school on Mondays absent bona fide illness and appropriate notice;

E. Order that both parties ensure Emily’s attendance at scheduled tutoring and educational support sessions, including those that occur during Father’s parenting time, unless properly rescheduled or cancelled;

F. Order both parties to cooperate with Emily’s school in addressing attendance and academic issues and to comply with reasonable school-based plans to support Emily’s education;

G. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests and welfare of Emily.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LAURA THOMPSON,
