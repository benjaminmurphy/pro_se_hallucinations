v.

CIVIL ACTION NO. _________  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT  

    This is an action for personal injuries arising from Defendant John Mitchell’s negligent failure to control and leash his dog in Greenough Park in Newton, Massachusetts, in violation of posted park rules and applicable law, which caused Plaintiff Emily Carter to take evasive action to avoid the charging, barking dog, fall down an embankment, and suffer a broken wrist and related injuries.  

PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff was lawfully present in Greenough Park in Newton, Massachusetts.  

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant John Mitchell (“Defendant”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, kept, possessed, or had control and custody of the dog involved in the incident described herein.  

JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for personal injuries within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  

4. Venue is proper in the Newton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the cause of action arose in Newton, Massachusetts, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction, and Defendant resides or may be found within this judicial district. See also G.L. c. 231, § 1.  

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately the afternoon hours, Plaintiff was jogging for exercise on a paved or improved path within Greenough Park, Newton, Massachusetts (“the Park”).  

6. At all relevant times, the City of Newton had posted clear signage in the Park requiring that all dogs be kept on leashes.  

7. On information and belief, Defendant is a regular user of the Park and regularly allows his large dog to run off‑leash notwithstanding the posted leash requirements.  

8. On the date in question, Defendant was present in the Park with his large dog.  

9. At that time, Defendant’s dog was not on a leash, and Defendant had the leash draped over his shoulder rather than attached to the dog’s collar or harness.  

10. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from Plaintiff, engaged in conversation with friends, and was not paying adequate attention to the location or behavior of his dog.  

11. As Plaintiff jogged along the path, Defendant’s large dog suddenly and without warning charged directly toward Plaintiff at high speed, barking loudly and aggressively.  

12. The dog approached Plaintiff from a short distance away and was closing the distance rapidly as it charged and barked.  

13. Plaintiff, reasonably fearing that the dog might bite or attack her, instinctively swerved off the paved path in an attempt to escape and avoid being bitten or knocked down by the dog.  

14. Plaintiff’s reaction to the charging, barking dog was an immediate, natural, and reasonable response to the perceived threat, under the circumstances then presented.  

15. In swerving off the path and away from the dog, Plaintiff’s foot caught on an exposed tree root or similar ground hazard near the edge of the path.  

16. Plaintiff then lost her balance and fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path.  

17. Plaintiff landed heavily on her arm and hand, suffering an immediate onset of severe pain in her wrist and other parts of her body.  

18. Although the dog came to a stop after Plaintiff fell, the dog’s charging and barking behavior had already caused Plaintiff to take evasive action that directly led to her fall and injuries.  

19. Defendant then called the dog back, but only after Plaintiff had already fallen and been injured.  

20. Several other joggers and park users in the vicinity witnessed the dog’s charge and barking, Plaintiff’s evasive maneuver off the path, and Plaintiff’s subsequent fall down the embankment.  

21. Plaintiff was assisted at the scene and ultimately sought emergency medical treatment. She presented to an emergency room where she was evaluated and diagnosed with, among other things, a fracture of the wrist and bruising caused by the fall.  

22. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff’s wrist was immobilized in a brace or similar device for several weeks, and she was required to limit or cease certain activities of daily living.  

23. Plaintiff incurred approximately Five Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($5,500) in reasonable and necessary medical expenses, including but not limited to emergency room care, diagnostic imaging, follow‑up care, and related treatments.  

24. Plaintiff also lost approximately Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) in wages due to missed work while recovering from her injuries and attending medical appointments.  

25. Plaintiff was further unable to participate in and perform at a piano recital for which she had been preparing, resulting in loss of enjoyment of life and significant emotional upset.  

26. Prior to this incident, Plaintiff was a healthy individual able to jog and engage in work and recreational activities without limitation.  

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, loss of function, emotional distress, interference with normal and usual activities, and loss of enjoyment of life.  

28. The harm suffered by Plaintiff was a foreseeable consequence of allowing a large dog to run at large, unleashed and uncontrolled, in a public park where people jog and walk on relatively narrow paths.  

COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  

29. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully set forth herein.  

30. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, keeping, and control of his dog so as to avoid causing foreseeable injury to members of the public lawfully present in the Park. See, e.g., Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co., 283 Mass. 158, 161 (1933) (duty of reasonable care toward lawful visitors); Glidden v. Szybiak, 338 Mass. 199, 202 (1958) (recognizing duties of dog owners).  

31. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to comply with applicable laws, ordinances, and posted rules governing the control and leashing of dogs in public spaces, including but not limited to the City of Newton’s leash laws and park regulations. See generally G.L. c. 140, §§ 136A–174E (regulating dogs and dog owners); G.L. c. 140, § 155 (imposing strict responsibility for dog‑related injuries; reflecting public policy that dog owners control their dogs).  

32. Massachusetts law follows the general principles of negligence that every person has a duty to act with the care of a reasonable person under the circumstances, and that liability attaches when a defendant’s breach of that duty is a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. See Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law); Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146‑47 (2006) (describing duty and foreseeability in negligence).  

33. In the circumstances of this case, a reasonably prudent dog owner, knowing or having reason to know that: (a) the Park contained joggers and other park users; (b) the Park had posted leash‑law signs; and (c) a large dog charging at a jogger while barking could cause fear and evasive action, would have kept the dog on a leash, under proper control, and would have prevented the dog from charging at or toward park users. See Whittaker v. Saraceno, 418 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1994) (duty based on foreseeable risk of harm); Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (standard is conduct of an ordinarily prudent person).  

34. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:  

   a. Failing to keep his dog leashed as required by posted rules and applicable law;  
   b. Allowing his dog to run at large off‑leash in the Park;  
   c. Failing to maintain reasonable control over his dog’s movements and interactions with park users;  
   d. Failing to pay adequate attention to his dog while conversing with others at a distance;  
   e. Permitting, or failing to prevent, the dog from charging and barking at Plaintiff as she lawfully jogged on the path;  
   f. Failing to timely recall or restrain the dog before it charged toward Plaintiff; and  
   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent dog owner would have acted under similar circumstances.  

35. The duty of reasonable care extends to injuries that are the foreseeable result of a defendant’s conduct, including injuries sustained when a plaintiff reasonably reacts to a danger created by the defendant. See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105‑06 (1978) (foreseeability of harm is central to duty and causation); Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 61 (1983) (duty extends to foreseeable reactions to reasonably anticipated risks).  

36. It was reasonably foreseeable that allowing a large dog to be unleashed and to charge, barking, toward a jogger on a park path would cause that jogger to instinctively veer off course, attempt to flee, or otherwise take evasive action, thereby risking a fall and injury. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302, 303, 442 (cited with approval in Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. at 151‑53) (foreseeable intervening acts and reactions).  

37. Defendant’s negligence need not include actual physical contact by the dog with Plaintiff; it is sufficient under Massachusetts law that Defendant’s negligent conduct set in motion a chain of events in which Plaintiff’s reasonable response to the apparent danger was a foreseeable consequence and a substantial factor in causing her injuries. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320‑21 (2002) (proximate cause encompasses harms that are the reasonably foreseeable result of defendant’s negligence); Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG, 399 Mass. 790, 794‑95 (1987) (cause in fact and foreseeability standards).  

38. Plaintiff’s reaction in swerving off the path to avoid the charging, barking dog was reasonable under the circumstances, and her conduct does not break the chain of causation. Rather, her conduct was precisely the type of reaction that was a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s failure to control his dog. See Jesionek, 376 Mass. at 105‑06 (intervening acts that are foreseeable do not break causation); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 443.  

39. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff fell down the embankment and sustained a broken wrist and multiple bruises, and suffered resulting damages as set forth above.  

40. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred and will continue to incur reasonable and necessary medical expenses in an amount presently estimated at approximately $5,500, for which Defendant is liable. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest on personal injury damages).  

41. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained lost wages and loss of earning capacity estimated at approximately $2,000, and may incur additional lost income and opportunities in the future.  

42. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life and recreational activities, including but not limited to her inability to participate in a piano recital and limitations on her ability to exercise and perform daily tasks. Compensation for such non‑economic harms is recoverable under Massachusetts law. See Haddad v. Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. (No. 1), 455 Mass. 91, 110‑11 (2009); Conley v. Moran, 406 Mass. 466, 468‑69 (1990).  

43. To the extent Defendant may contend that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies any such negligence. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged negligence by Plaintiff would at most be comparatively weighed by the trier of fact and would not bar recovery so long as Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than Defendant’s. See Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 56‑57 (1988) (discussing comparative negligence statute).  

44. Under applicable statutes and common law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover full and fair compensation for her injuries and losses, together with statutory prejudgment interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C; Mirageas v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 391 Mass. 815, 818‑19 (1984).
