COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Collins (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Linda Matthews (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Collins is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852.

2. Defendant Linda Matthews is an individual who, upon information and belief, is the owner, lessor, and/or landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and was responsible for maintaining the Premises in compliance with applicable state and local housing, sanitary, and building codes.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 when accounting for statutory damages, potential treble damages, and attorney’s fees available by statute, even though Plaintiff presently seeks approximately $200 in actual damages.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because Defendant owns, manages, and controls residential rental property in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

6. Venue in Middlesex Superior Court is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County and the Premises are located in Middlesex County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

8. Plaintiff has resided continuously at the Premises as her home since on or about June 1, 2022.

9. Plaintiff agreed to and has paid monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00 to Defendant for the Premises.

10. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied warranty of habitability and a covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 186, § 14.

11. Plaintiff’s bathroom in the Premises has no window and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation.

12. Beginning in or about 2025 (and on dates more particularly known to Defendant), mold growth appeared in the corner of the shower in Plaintiff’s bathroom.

13. Over time, the mold spread from the corner of the shower to the surrounding bathroom areas, including up the walls and onto the bathroom ceiling.

14. The presence and spread of mold in a bathroom of a residential dwelling constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code and renders the premises unfit for human habitation and potentially dangerous to the life, health, and safety of occupants. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.100 (maintenance), 410.300 (owner’s responsibility), and 410.602 (conditions that may endanger or impair health or safety).

15. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition after discovering it.

16. Defendant came to the Premises to inspect the bathroom and observed the mold in and around Plaintiff’s shower and on the ceiling.

17. Instead of arranging for proper remediation and repair, Defendant blamed Plaintiff for the mold problem, claiming that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and that Plaintiff took showers that were “too hot and too long.”

18. Plaintiff does run the bathroom exhaust fan during showers, though perhaps not every single time, and Plaintiff takes normal hot showers typical of ordinary residential use.

19. Mold growth in a bathroom without a window, and with inadequate ventilation, is a condition reasonably within the landlord’s responsibility to prevent and remediate through proper construction, maintenance, and repair, and is not reasonably attributable to ordinary, lawful use of the premises by the tenant.

20. Plaintiff’s ordinary bathing practices were consistent with normal residential use and did not constitute misuse or waste.

21. Defendant acknowledged the existence of the mold and indicated that she would clean the existing mold but refused to address the underlying cause, including adequate ventilation and any hidden moisture problems, on the stated ground that Plaintiff had “caused” the problem.

22. Defendant’s refusal to address the ventilation and to correct the underlying conditions causing and perpetuating mold growth has allowed the condition to persist and recur.

23. Following the appearance and spread of mold, Plaintiff began experiencing respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing that Plaintiff had not experienced before residing at the Premises under these conditions.

24. Plaintiff sought medical attention, and Plaintiff’s doctor indicated that Plaintiff’s respiratory problems were likely related to or aggravated by exposure to mold in the bathroom and advised that the mold condition should be remediated.

25. As a result of the mold growth in the bathroom, Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property including Plaintiff’s shower curtain and certain towels that became moldy and unusable, with an approximate replacement cost of $60.00.

26. Plaintiff has incurred and continues to incur physical discomfort, respiratory distress, inconvenience, anxiety, and loss of use and enjoyment of a clean, safe, and habitable bathroom due to the persistent mold condition.

27. Defendant has refused to take reasonable, code-compliant measures to remediate the mold and the underlying moisture and ventilation problems in the bathroom, despite actual notice and a reasonable opportunity to correct the condition.

28. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure and refusal to properly repair it have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly the bathroom, which is an essential part of a habitable dwelling.

29. Under the State Sanitary Code, the landlord bears the responsibility to maintain the premises in compliance with health and safety regulations, regardless of whether the tenant complains or the landlord is formally cited by local authorities. See 105 C.M.R. 410.300; see also Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 200–201.

30. Defendant’s failure to correct the unsanitary and unsafe condition of mold in the bathroom, after notice, constitutes a breach of her statutory and common-law obligations to maintain habitable premises and not to interfere with Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

31. Mold conditions of the type described are recognized as conditions that may endanger or materially impair the health or safety of occupants and thus constitute interference with quiet enjoyment when the landlord, after notice, fails or refuses to remedy them. See Cruz Management Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

32. Plaintiff has continued to tender rent in accordance with the tenancy, despite the impairment of habitability and the substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

33. Plaintiff reasonably values her damages, including but not limited to property loss, loss of use and enjoyment, physical discomfort and respiratory symptoms, inconvenience, and statutory remedies, at not less than $200.00 in actual damages, subject to enhancement or trebling as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14.

34. All conditions precedent to bringing this action have been satisfied, excused, or rendered futile by Defendant’s conduct and refusals.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

35. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully set forth herein.

36. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

37. Massachusetts law recognizes that a landlord’s failure to remedy serious and recurring conditions that endanger or materially impair the health or safety of a tenant, after notice, constitutes an “indirect interference” with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Management Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–776 (1994); Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, 417 Mass. 273, 284–285 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

38. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment is read broadly to protect tenants from serious interferences with the character and value of their tenancy, including conditions of disrepair and code violations that the landlord fails or refuses to correct. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–852 (1997); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–104 (1982).

39. The mold growth and unsanitary, unsafe condition of Plaintiff’s bathroom constitute a condition that materially impairs the character and value of Plaintiff’s tenancy and endangers or substantially threatens Plaintiff’s health and safety, in violation of the State Sanitary Code. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–201.

40. Defendant had actual notice of the mold condition in Plaintiff’s bathroom after Plaintiff reported it and Defendant personally inspected it.

41. Despite such notice, Defendant failed and refused to arrange for proper remediation of the mold condition and the underlying causes, and instead blamed Plaintiff and declined to improve the ventilation or otherwise eliminate the underlying moisture and mold problem.

42. Defendant’s failure and refusal, after notice and within a reasonable time, to correct the mold, moisture, and ventilation problems constitutes an unlawful, indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Management, 417 Mass. at 774–776; Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716–717; Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, 417 Mass. at 284–285.

43. Defendant’s conduct is likewise inconsistent with the implied warranty of habitability and the requirements of the State Sanitary Code, and such code violations and habitability defects are recognized bases for finding a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–201; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–852; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979).

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of personal property (shower curtain and towels) valued at approximately $60.00;  
   b. Physical discomfort and respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing;  
   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of a safe, sanitary bathroom and associated inconvenience and distress; and  
   d. Diminished value of the rental premises and interference with the character and value of Plaintiff’s tenancy.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

46. Three months’ rent at Plaintiff’s monthly rent of $1,200.00 is $3,600.00, which exceeds Plaintiff’s actual out-of-pocket losses and is therefore the proper statutory measure of damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

47. Massachusetts courts enforce the mandatory nature of at least three months’ rent as damages upon proof of a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, irrespective of the precise dollar value of proven actual damages. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–104; Cruz Management, 417 Mass. at 774–776; Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 872–874 (1991).

48. Plaintiff, as a pro se litigant, seeks the full statutory remedies available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including not less than three months’ rent in damages, plus costs; Plaintiff reserves any claim to attorney’s fees to the extent permitted by statute or court rule if Plaintiff later obtains legal representation.

---

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITIES (STATUTES AND CASES RELIED UPON)

49. Without limiting the foregoing, Plaintiff’s claim is supported by and relies upon the following Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and cases, among others:

   a. G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment, damages of not less than three months’ rent, costs, and attorney’s fees);  
   b. G.L. c. 239, § 8A (defenses and counterclaims in summary process, reflecting public policy of protecting tenants from code violations and interference with quiet enjoyment);  
   c. Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (implied warranty of habitability; duties to maintain sanitary, safe premises);  
   d. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord liability for code violations and habitability defects);  
   e. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (indirect interference with quiet enjoyment; landlord liability without direct intent where interference is natural and probable consequence of landlord’s actions or inactions);  
   f. Cruz Management Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994) (quiet enjoyment violations through failure to correct serious conditions affecting health and safety);  
   g. Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (scope of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and non‑delegable obligations of landlord);  
   h. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (damages and remedies, including emotional distress, for interference with quiet enjoyment);  
   i. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (relationship between code violations, warranty of habitability, and quiet enjoyment);  
   j. Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (application and mandatory nature of statutory damages under landlord‑tenant statutes);  
   k. 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation, landlord responsibilities for safe, sanitary conditions).

3. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action;
