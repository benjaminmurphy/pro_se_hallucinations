COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
__________________________________________  

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Moore (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Moore”), is an individual residing in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her current address for purposes of this action is 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant, Karen Thompson (“Defendant” or “Ms. Thompson”), is an individual who owns, operates, and/or manages a residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, §§ 11–15F and applicable Massachusetts common law.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for money damages arising from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the Lowell District Court.

6. The Premises are located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of herein occurred in Lowell. Venue is therefore proper in the Lowell District Court. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant to rent a residential apartment at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises as her home since on or about June 1, 2021.

9. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant for the Premises.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant retained control over and responsibility for the building structure, systems, and conditions affecting health and safety at the Premises, including bathroom ventilation and the prevention and remediation of mold and moisture conditions.

11. The bathroom in Plaintiff’s apartment does not have a window. It has only a mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation.

12. At some point during Plaintiff’s tenancy, mold growth appeared in the corner of the shower in Plaintiff’s bathroom. Over time, the mold spread to the bathroom ceiling and other surfaces.

13. The mold was visible and persistent, and was of a kind and extent that a reasonable tenant would view as a health concern and a substantial interference with normal use of the bathroom.

14. Plaintiff used the bathroom exhaust fan when showering and took ordinary hot showers consistent with normal residential use.

15. Upon observing the mold growth, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition in the bathroom and requested that Defendant address and remediate the problem.

16. Defendant came to the Premises to inspect the mold condition after Plaintiff’s complaint.

17. After viewing the mold, Defendant improperly and unreasonably blamed Plaintiff, claiming that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and that Plaintiff’s showers were “too hot and too long.”

18. Defendant refused to take responsibility for the defective bathroom ventilation and moisture conditions that allowed mold to form and spread.

19. Defendant stated that she would clean the existing mold but would not address, repair, or improve the ventilation or other underlying conditions that were causing the mold growth, asserting that Plaintiff had “caused” the problem.

20. Defendant’s response failed to provide a permanent or adequate remedy and left Plaintiff to continue living in a bathroom environment that encouraged the recurrence and spread of mold.

21. Since the development of the mold, Plaintiff has experienced respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which she did not experience prior to the mold condition.

22. Plaintiff sought medical evaluation. Her doctor advised that her respiratory symptoms were likely related to or exacerbated by the mold exposure in her bathroom and recommended that the mold be properly remediated.

23. As a direct result of the mold condition, Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property that became moldy, including her shower curtain and towels, at an approximate replacement cost of $60.

24. The ongoing mold growth, Defendant’s refusal to properly remediate it, and Defendant’s refusal to correct the underlying ventilation and moisture problems have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment, especially the bathroom.

25. The bathroom is an essential part of the dwelling unit, and the persistent mold and dampness in a windowless bathroom create an unhealthy and unsafe environment that materially impairs the character and value of the leased premises as a habitable residence.

26. Plaintiff has suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her apartment, inconvenience, physical discomfort, and anxiety regarding her health due to the continuing mold condition and Defendant’s failure to correct it.

27. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has acted reasonably and used the Premises in a normal residential manner consistent with her rights as a tenant.

28. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that mold growth in a windowless bathroom, coupled with inadequate ventilation, posed a risk to the health and safety of the occupants and rendered the Premises, in relevant part, unfit for its intended residential use.

29. Defendant, despite actual notice of the mold condition and its health effects on Plaintiff, failed and refused to take timely, reasonable, and adequate steps to correct the defective conditions and to prevent the continuing presence and recurrence of mold.

30. Defendant’s acts and omissions have been intentional, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, including her statutory right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

31. As a result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has sustained actual damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment, out‑of‑pocket property loss of approximately $60, and physical discomfort and distress, for which she reasonably estimates and claims at least $250 in damages, subject to statutory multiplication, interest, costs, and such additional amounts as the Court deems just.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 31 above as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” and is liable to the tenant for at least three months’ rent or three times the tenant’s actual damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, for any violation.

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law is implied in every residential lease and protects tenants from substantial interference with their tenancy caused by the landlord. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

35. A landlord may breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment not only by affirmative acts but also by omissions and neglect that result in conditions substantially interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Al Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

36. Defendant, after receiving notice of the mold condition and its impact on Plaintiff, failed and refused to adequately repair, remediate, or correct the conditions leading to the mold growth in Plaintiff’s bathroom, and instead improperly blamed Plaintiff.

37. Defendant’s failure to correct the mold and the underlying ventilation and moisture problems in a windowless bathroom constitutes a serious interference with the conditions of habitability and with Plaintiff’s safe use of the bathroom and, by extension, the apartment as a whole. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing landlord’s obligations to maintain premises in habitable condition).

38. Substantial and ongoing mold growth in an interior bathroom without a window is inconsistent with the requirements of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.482 (ventilation) and provisions requiring landlords to maintain dwellings in a condition free from chronic dampness and conditions that may endanger or impair the health or safety of an occupant. See also 105 C.M.R. 410.300 et seq.

39. A landlord’s failure to correct unsanitary or unsafe conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code and materially affect health and safety may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).

40. Defendant’s conduct here is analogous to the landlord misconduct held actionable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in cases such as Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for interference with quiet enjoyment where he allowed conditions substantially impairing tenants’ use of premises) and Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s failure to remedy chronic flooding and unsanitary conditions constituted a breach).

41. Defendant’s omission and refusal to provide an effective remedy for the unsafe mold condition, despite notice, caused a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy that was reasonably foreseeable, and in fact known, to Defendant. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

42. Defendant’s failure to remedy the mold condition and underlying ventilation defect is a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, even absent an express intent to disturb Plaintiff’s rights. See Al Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997) (landlord liability for failure to correct conditions); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

43. The persistent mold condition and Defendant’s neglect also amount to a material breach of the implied warranty of habitability recognized in Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and such a breach, when sufficiently serious, can also support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).

44. Moreover, Massachusetts law recognizes that a landlord’s failure to maintain sanitary and safe conditions that affect the tenant’s health can give rise to statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979).

45. Defendant’s failure to remedy the mold condition and ensure adequate ventilation was not a mere trivial or isolated event but a continuing course of conduct that allowed the condition to persist and Plaintiff’s resulting harm to continue.

46. Defendant’s actions and inactions were intentional and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory rights and of the foreseeable harms to Plaintiff’s health and quiet enjoyment of her home.

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

    a. Diminution and interference with the use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly the bathroom;

    b. Discomfort, inconvenience, and anxiety regarding her health;

    c. Respiratory symptoms and physical discomfort associated with mold exposure; and

    d. Loss of personal property (mold‑damaged items) valued at approximately $60.

48. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to statutory damages in an amount not less than three months’ rent or three times her actual damages, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

49. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200. Three months’ rent is therefore $3,600, which exceeds three times Plaintiff’s estimated actual damages of $250. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks statutory damages of at least $3,600, plus costs, and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper, in accordance with G.L. c. 186, § 14.

50. To the extent applicable, Plaintiff also invokes her protection from retaliatory conduct under G.L. c. 186, § 18, and notes that landlord burdens arising from code violations and conditions affecting health and safety cannot be shifted to a tenant by blaming ordinary, reasonable use of the premises. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994).

C. An award of Plaintiff’s actual damages, including but not limited to property damage, loss of use and enjoyment, and physical discomfort, in an amount to be determined at trial, to the extent such amounts are not superseded by the statutory minimum;
