The opinion discusses standards for initial custody determinations and for permitting a custodial parent to relocate children out of the Commonwealth, but it does not address the court\u2019s authority or standard to modify existing custody or parenting time orders based on a material change of circumstances.

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cCases involving removal of a child from the jurisdiction present difficult choices. Unless one is to apply a fixed but arbitrary rule, the issue can be resolved only on a case by case basis. The effect on the child of any removal is most important. An evaluation of the best interests of the child requires attention to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change \u2026 and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u201d"
