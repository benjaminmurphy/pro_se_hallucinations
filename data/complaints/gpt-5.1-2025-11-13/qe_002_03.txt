------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell (“Plaintiff”), for his* complaint against Defendant Samantha Baker (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), states as follows:

\*Plaintiff’s pronouns are not known; masculine pronouns are used only for drafting convenience and are not intended to be limiting.

--------------------------------  
I. PARTIES  
--------------------------------  

1. Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell is an individual residing in the basement dwelling unit at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Samantha Baker is an individual who owns and/or manages the residential property located at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119, and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has exercised control over, and had responsibility for, the condition, maintenance, and repair of the Premises and the building in which the Premises are located.

--------------------------------  
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
--------------------------------  

4. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5. The Boston Housing Court Department has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 2, 3, because this is a civil action involving the residential premises located in Boston/Roxbury and arises out of the landlord‑tenant relationship.

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Division of the Housing Court because the Premises are located at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred there.

--------------------------------  
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
--------------------------------  

7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the basement apartment at 24–26 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the basement unit at the Premises as his primary residence since on or about March 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant.

9. Defendant, as landlord, has at all times owed Plaintiff the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteed by G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as the common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases in Massachusetts. See, e.g., Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929).

10. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late paying the monthly rent due to unforeseen medical bills, but he subsequently paid the full rent then due plus any late fee charged by Defendant, curing the late payment.

11. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff began to observe water intrusion into the basement unit whenever it rained heavily.

12. The water seeped through a basement wall of the Premises and entered Plaintiff’s living space, causing visible dampness and accumulating moisture on the floor and wall.

13. The water intrusion damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf that had been located against the affected wall, resulting in property loss of approximately $400.

14. As a result of the chronic dampness and water infiltration, Plaintiff has been required to run a dehumidifier constantly in order to attempt to mitigate moisture, mold, and musty conditions, causing an increase in Plaintiff’s electric utility costs.

15. The recurring water intrusion and excessive moisture have rendered the Premises excessively damp, unsanitary, and unhealthy to occupy, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500 et seq. (structural elements, protection from water and weather) and 105 C.M.R. 410.750 (conditions deemed to endanger or impair health or safety).

16. Upon noticing the water problem in November 2025, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message, informing her of the water seeping into the basement unit during heavy rain and requesting repairs.

17. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” thereby acknowledging notice of the defect, but failed to take timely and reasonable steps to investigate and correct the water intrusion.

18. Several weeks passed after Plaintiff’s initial report without any meaningful repair or remediation work being done by Defendant to address the water infiltration, the associated moisture, or the resulting damage.

19. Because Defendant did not resolve the problem, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department (or equivalent local code enforcement authority) and requested an inspection of the Premises.

20. The city inspectors subsequently came to the Premises, inspected Plaintiff’s unit, and identified the water intrusion issue as well as other housing or code violations.

21. The inspection and findings by local code enforcement put Defendant on further actual and constructive notice that the Premises were in violation of the State Sanitary Code and not fit for human habitation, and that substantial water problems existed in Plaintiff’s basement apartment.

22. Despite having notice from both Plaintiff and municipal inspectors, Defendant failed and has continued to fail to make appropriate and timely repairs to stop the water intrusion, to correct the underlying defects, or to fully remediate any resulting moisture, mold, or sanitation issues.

23. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to repair, Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises has been materially and substantially interfered with, including but not limited to:

   a. Persistent water seepage during heavy rains;  
   b. Damage to Plaintiff’s personal belongings (rug and bookshelf, approximately $400 in loss);  
   c. The need to constantly operate a dehumidifier to combat dampness, with attendant increased electrical usage and cost;  
   d. Discomfort, anxiety, and disruption caused by living in a damp, water‑infiltrated basement unit.

24. In response to Plaintiff’s efforts to seek code compliance and repairs by contacting the city, Defendant has characterized Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

25. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that she does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 (or March 2025 if the lease is on that schedule), asserting that the reason is Plaintiff’s earlier late rent in October, despite Plaintiff’s having fully cured that late payment.

26. The threatened non‑renewal and labeling of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” occurred only after Plaintiff reported the water problem to Defendant and then sought relief from municipal inspectors, and after the city found violations, rendering Defendant’s stated reason (the previously cured late rent) pretextual and retaliatory in nature.

27. Defendant’s refusal to remedy the water intrusion, her failure to correct code violations, and her retaliatory treatment of Plaintiff have together substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

28. Plaintiff has at all times acted reasonably in reporting defects, seeking repairs, and invoking his rights under the State Sanitary Code and Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law.

29. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to lost and damaged personal property (approximately $400), increased utility costs, diminished value of the tenancy, loss of use and enjoyment of his home, and emotional distress and inconvenience caused by living in persistently defective and damp conditions.

-------------------------------  
IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14  
-------------------------------  

30. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and any landlord who does so is liable for actual and consequential damages or for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

32. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14 is both statutory and an implied contractual term of every residential tenancy in Massachusetts. See, e.g., Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–38 (1929).

33. To establish a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a tenant need not show an actual or constructive eviction, but only that the landlord’s acts or omissions caused a substantial interference with the tenant’s tenancy. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

34. A landlord’s failure to remedy serious sanitary code and water infiltration conditions after notice can constitute an “indirect interference” with tenants’ quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983–84 (1982); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987).

35. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., requires that residential premises be maintained in a condition fit for human habitation, including being watertight and free from chronic dampness and water penetration. Serious code violations that affect health and safety give rise to a breach of the implied warranty of habitability and may also support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 198–203 (1973).

36. Defendant had actual notice of the water intrusion and related unsanitary conditions from Plaintiff’s written/text communication in November 2025, and additional actual and constructive notice arising from the inspection and findings of the City of Boston code enforcement officials.

37. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps within a reasonable time to investigate and correct the sources of water intrusion, to stop water from entering Plaintiff’s unit, and to remediate resultant damage and any hazardous conditions.

38. Defendant’s prolonged inaction and failure to repair after notice constitute an indirect but substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983–84; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994).

39. Additionally, retaliatory conduct in response to a tenant’s reporting of code violations and seeking enforcement of sanitary and housing laws can itself be deemed an interference with quiet enjoyment. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994); Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 790–91.

40. Plaintiff engaged in protected activity by contacting the city for an inspection concerning unsanitary and unsafe conditions at the Premises, which is activity expressly contemplated and protected by Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law and policy. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; see also G.L. c. 239, § 2A (retaliation presumption in summary process context, by analogy).

41. After learning of Plaintiff’s contact with municipal inspectors and the resulting findings of housing/code violations, Defendant labeled Plaintiff a “problem tenant” and informed him that his lease would not be renewed, even though the only cited reason—late rent in October—had been fully cured and preceded the inspection.

42. The sequence of events, timing, and Defendant’s statements support the inference that Defendant’s non‑renewal decision and hostile demeanor toward Plaintiff were made in retaliation for Plaintiff’s efforts to enforce his housing rights and to secure code‑compliant conditions, constituting an indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

43. Massachusetts courts recognize that landlord retaliation against a tenant for complaints to authorities about housing conditions is unlawful and can support claims under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related doctrines. See, e.g., Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 285–86; Spence v. O’Brien, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 491–95 (1983).

44. The combined effect of (a) chronic water intrusion and moisture, (b) damage to property, (c) increased utility expenses, (d) persistent failure to repair, and (e) retaliatory conduct and threats regarding non‑renewal has substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use, comfort, and enjoyment of his home.

45. Such substantial impairment constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, regardless of whether there has yet been an actual eviction or formal termination of the tenancy. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–18; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982).

46. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:  

   a. Approximately $400 in loss of and damage to personal belongings (rug and bookshelf);  
   b. Increased electric bills due to the need to operate a dehumidifier continuously;  
   c. Diminished rental value and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; and  
   d. Distress, discomfort, and inconvenience.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover his actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 789–91; Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

48. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200 per month, so three months’ rent is $3,600, which exceeds the approximately $400 in property damage alone. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages of at least three months’ rent, plus additional actual consequential damages (including increased utility costs and loss of use and enjoyment) to the extent allowed, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

--------------------------------  
V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
--------------------------------  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Samantha Baker, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than three months’ rent ($3,600), or Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, including but not limited to compensation for:

   2. Increased utility and dehumidification costs; and  
   3. Loss of use, comfort, and enjoyment of the Premises;

C. An order directing Defendant to promptly correct the water intrusion and any related housing or code violations at the Premises, including any necessary repairs and remediation to bring the property into full compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.;

D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14 (with attorneys’ fees to be determined if and when counsel appears or is appointed);

E. Such other and further legal or equitable relief as the Court deems just and proper.

VI. JURY DEMAND  
--------------------------------  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
