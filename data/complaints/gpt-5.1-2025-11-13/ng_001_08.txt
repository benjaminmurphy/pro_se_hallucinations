    Plaintiff,

v.

SOMERVILLE GROCERY STORE, INC.,  
    Defendant.


COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE


Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Somerville Grocery Store, Inc. (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff was a lawful patron and business invitee at Defendant’s grocery store located in Somerville, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Somerville Grocery Store, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and, upon information and belief, maintains and operates a retail grocery store located at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, MA 02143.

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries sounding in negligence arising out of an incident that occurred on or about September 16, 2023, at Defendant’s premises located at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, MA 02143 (the “Premises”).

4. The amount of damages reasonably believed to be recoverable by Plaintiff is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A and 21, and G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the Defendant does business in this Commonwealth and the causes of action arose within this Commonwealth.

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about Saturday, September 16, 2023, at approximately mid‑afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a customer of Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, MA 02143.

8. At all times relevant, Plaintiff was a business invitee to whom Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, maintenance, and control of the Premises, including the aisles, floors, and walking surfaces of the store.  
   See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowners owe lawful visitors a duty of reasonable care); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 379–80 (2010).

9. While shopping in the dairy aisle of the Premises, Plaintiff encountered a puddle of spilled milk on the floor (the “Spill”).

10. The Spill was not minor or hidden; it was large enough that visible shopping cart wheel tracks extended through it, indicating that other customers had already passed through the Spill prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

11. There were no visible warning signs, cones, or “wet floor” signs in or around the Spill, nor any effort to block off the affected area of the dairy aisle from customers.

12. The floor in the area of the Spill appeared to be of a type and finish that became slippery when wet, which was or should have been known to Defendant in the exercise of reasonable care.

13. As Plaintiff walked in the dairy aisle in the course of shopping in a normal and reasonable manner, she stepped into the Spill, her foot slipped, and she fell forcefully onto her hip and side, landing on the hard floor surface.

14. At or about the time of the incident, an employee of Defendant was stocking shelves in the dairy aisle approximately fifteen (15) feet from where Plaintiff fell.

15. After Plaintiff fell, the employee approached Plaintiff and stated, in substance, that he had noticed the Spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing what he was doing before he was going to get the mop.

16. The employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual knowledge of the existence of the Spill prior to Plaintiff’s fall, and that there was a delay of several minutes, at minimum, between the employee’s observation of the Spill and any meaningful action to remedy, clean, or warn of the hazardous condition.

17. Alternatively, and/or in addition, the existence of cart tracks through the Spill demonstrates that the hazardous condition had existed for sufficient time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied or warned of it, thereby establishing constructive notice.  
    See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 784–86 (2007) (mode of operation and notice principles); Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

18. At no time prior to her fall did any employee or agent of Defendant warn Plaintiff of the Spill, attempt to block access to the area, or take reasonable steps to protect customers from the hazard.

19. Plaintiff, having no knowledge of the Spill and no reason to anticipate that there would be unmarked slippery liquid on the floor, was walking with due care and attention appropriate to a customer in a grocery store.  
    See Mounsey, 363 Mass. at 708 (reasonable care standard).

20. As a direct and proximate result of stepping into the Spill and falling, Plaintiff sustained a serious hip injury, later diagnosed as a hip sprain, resulting in pain, limitation of movement, and the need for ongoing medical treatment and physical therapy.

21. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff initially believed that she might be able to continue her day and completed her shopping. However, over the course of the evening and into the night, her hip pain significantly increased and she experienced stiffness and difficulty ambulating.

22. On or about the following day, September 17, 2023, Plaintiff presented to an urgent care clinic, where she was examined and diagnosed with a hip sprain and related soft tissue injuries.

23. Medical professionals recommended rest, restricted activity, pain management, and a course of physical therapy to address Plaintiff’s injuries.

24. Plaintiff thereafter underwent physical therapy sessions as prescribed in order to address pain, loss of range of motion, and functional impairment.

25. As a result of the injuries sustained in the fall, Plaintiff was unable to work certain scheduled shifts at her café job, causing her to lose wages.

26. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date related to the injuries described herein are approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00).

27. Plaintiff’s lost wages to date related to the injuries described herein are approximately Eight Hundred Dollars ($800.00).

28. Plaintiff continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limitations associated with the hip injury, particularly with prolonged standing, walking, or other physical activities.

29. Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer conscious pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and other non‑economic damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.  
    See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (interest in personal injury actions); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 781–82 (1975).

30. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its officers, managers, employees, and/or agents, was responsible for establishing and enforcing reasonable policies and procedures for inspection, cleaning, and maintenance of the floors and aisles of the Premises, including the dairy aisle.

31. At all relevant times, Defendant had a duty to properly train, supervise, and direct its employees to promptly identify, remedy, and/or warn of dangerous conditions on the floors of the Premises, especially in areas, such as the dairy aisle, where spills of liquids are reasonably foreseeable.  
    See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 785–86 (mode of operation doctrine as to self-service supermarket operations); Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc., 471 Mass. 679, 684–86 (2015).

32. Defendant failed to adopt, implement, or enforce adequate inspection and maintenance practices reasonably designed to detect and address spills and other slipperiness‑creating conditions in a timely manner.

33. Defendant failed to ensure that employees were trained and directed to immediately respond to known spills by cleaning them up, posting warning signs, or otherwise protecting customers from foreseeable harm.

34. The employee’s admitted delay—choosing to “finish what he was doing” rather than immediately address a known spill in a busy customer aisle—was unreasonable and fell below the standard of care owed to business invitees.

35. Defendant’s conduct, as more fully described herein, constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law and was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  
    See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973); Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 54–56 (1983).

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

36. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 35 above as if fully set forth herein.

37. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land who invites members of the public onto the premises for business purposes owes those invitees a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect them against foreseeable risks of harm.  
    See Mounsey, 363 Mass. at 707–08; Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 379–80; Bohenko v. Grzyb, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 961, 962 (1986).

38. Defendant, as the owner and/or operator of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, maintenance, and control of the Premises, including but not limited to:

   a. Conducting reasonable and regular inspections of the aisles and floors, particularly in areas where spills are reasonably foreseeable, such as the dairy aisle;

   b. Promptly remedying, cleaning, or otherwise removing spilled liquids or other hazards on the floor;

   c. Adequately warning customers, by signs, cones, or otherwise, of the existence of hazardous conditions such as slippery spills;

   d. Training, supervising, and directing employees to recognize and promptly respond to hazardous conditions; and

   e. Adopting and enforcing reasonable policies and procedures to prevent or reduce the risk of slip‑and‑fall incidents.

39. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to timely clean up or otherwise remedy the Spill after Defendant’s employee had actual knowledge of its existence;

   b. Allowing the Spill to remain on the floor of the dairy aisle for an unreasonable period of time, as evidenced by the presence of cart tracks through the Spill;

   c. Failing to place a warning sign, cone, or other barrier near the Spill to alert customers of the hazardous condition;

   d. Failing to instruct or require the employee who noticed the Spill to immediately attend to it and protect customers, rather than delay for the employee’s convenience;

   e. Failing to establish or implement reasonable inspection and cleaning procedures to promptly detect and address spilled liquids;

   f. Failing to adequately train and supervise its employees regarding the identification and prompt remediation of floor hazards; and

   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent owner and operator of a grocery store would under the same or similar circumstances.

40. Defendant either knew of the Spill (actual notice) through its employee’s observation of it prior to Plaintiff’s fall or, alternatively and/or in addition, the Spill existed for such a time and under such circumstances that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered its presence (constructive notice).  
    See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 784–86; Deagle, 343 Mass. at 264–65; Godbout v. Cousens, 396 Mass. 254, 257–58 (1985).

41. Under the “mode of operation” doctrine applicable to self‑service retail establishments, Defendant’s chosen method of operation—permitting customers to select and handle dairy products and other items likely to leak or spill without continuous employee monitoring—created a reasonably foreseeable risk that spills such as the one at issue would occur in customer walkways, thereby imposing on Defendant a duty to take reasonable precautions commensurate with that risk.  
    See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 785–86; Sarkisian, 471 Mass. at 685–86.

42. Defendant failed to take reasonable precautions consistent with its mode of operation, including adequate inspection frequency, employee deployment, training, and immediate response protocols for spills, and thus failed to meet its duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law.

43. Defendant’s negligence, as described herein, was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and the injuries and damages that followed.  
    See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 54–56; Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978).

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries including, but not limited to, a hip sprain and related soft‑tissue injuries, causing pain, impairment, and the need for medical treatment and physical therapy.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00), and reasonably anticipates that she may incur additional medical expenses in the future related to her injuries.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of Eight Hundred Dollars ($800.00) due to her inability to work certain scheduled shifts at her café job during her period of recovery.

47. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, physical discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and other non‑economic damages, for which she is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation under Massachusetts law.  
    See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence framework); doCanto, 367 Mass. at 781–82; Santos v. Chrysler Corp., 430 Mass. 198, 205–06 (1999).

48. Plaintiff is entitled to recover pre‑ and post‑judgment interest on her damages at the statutory rate pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B and § 6H.
