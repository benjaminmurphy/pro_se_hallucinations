COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  


Plaintiff, Alexandra Rivera (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Rivera”), for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Alexandra Rivera is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is a residential tenant of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is, on information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 for breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment in a residential tenancy.

4. The Boston Housing Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 5, as this action concerns a residential tenancy and alleged violations of Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law occurring within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, a Boston neighborhood within Suffolk County, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there. G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 185C, § 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about December 1, 2022, Plaintiff commenced a written residential tenancy for a studio apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

7. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, which she has been obligated to pay each month pursuant to the lease and/or tenancy agreement.

8. During the pre‑rental showing, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the Premises.

9. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about these stains and was told by Defendant that the stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”

10. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s representation that the leak had been fully repaired when she agreed to enter into the tenancy.

11. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, during the first significant rainstorm, water began to drip from the same area of the ceiling where the water stains were located.

12. The water intrusion has recurred during subsequent rainstorms and has worsened over time.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the recurring leak and water intrusion on multiple occasions.

14. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant repeatedly characterized the condition as a “minor cosmetic issue” and told Plaintiff that she knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.

15. Defendant failed and refused to meaningfully investigate or repair the water leak, or to hire qualified contractors to do so, despite having actual notice of the recurring and worsening condition.

16. During at least one substantial rainstorm, the leak was severe enough that water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined a laptop that Plaintiff had left on her coffee table.

17. Plaintiff’s laptop was rendered unusable and Plaintiff was required to replace it at a cost of approximately $900.

18. Over time, the repeated water intrusion has caused a persistent musty odor in the Premises and raised concerns of mold growth.

19. Since the onset of the water intrusion and musty odor, Plaintiff has experienced recurring headaches that she reasonably believes are related to the damp conditions and likely mold.

20. Because of the leak and resulting dampness, Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed away from the affected area of the apartment and is effectively confined to living in only a portion of her small studio.

21. The water intrusion, musty odor, and suspected mold substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home in a safe, sanitary, and comfortable manner.

22. The conditions described above have persisted over a period of months despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints to Defendant.

23. Defendant has not taken timely, reasonable, or effective steps to repair the leak, remediate the moisture damage, or correct any resultant mold or unsanitary conditions.

24. The recurring water leak and resulting conditions likely violate the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., which requires owners to maintain dwellings in a safe, clean, and sanitary condition and to keep the structure of the building, including the roof, in good repair and watertight. See 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.550, 410.602.

25. Defendant either knew or reasonably should have known, prior to the start of Plaintiff’s tenancy, that the ceiling leak had not been fully repaired and that the condition was likely to recur.

26. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s complaints and the obvious nature of the water intrusion, Defendant has intentionally, or at minimum with reckless or grossly negligent disregard, failed to correct the condition.

27. Defendant’s refusal to make necessary repairs after notice of the problem was willful in that he repeatedly dismissed the condition as merely “cosmetic” and minimized Plaintiff’s concerns rather than taking steps to protect her tenancy.

28. Plaintiff has suffered actual harm as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, including, but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Premises;  
   b. Damage to personal property, including the destruction of her laptop (approximately $900) and damage to her couch;  
   c. Physical discomfort, including headaches believed to be related to the damp and musty conditions; and  
   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and disruption to her daily life.

29. Based on the problems she has endured, Plaintiff estimates that she is owed at least $1,200 in damages and reserves the right to present evidence of additional damages at trial.

30. Plaintiff has at all times been ready, willing, and able to comply with her obligations as a tenant.

31. Defendant’s actions and inactions have caused a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–31 above as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of a residential tenant’s premises, and a landlord who does so is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

34. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 protects a tenant against serious and substantial interference by the landlord with the tenant’s tenancy rights. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

35. In Massachusetts, a landlord’s failure to correct serious defects or conditions in a rental unit after notice from the tenant can constitute a “direct or indirect interference” with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

36. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that persistent conditions such as water leaks, mold, and uncorrected code violations can amount to substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 283–84 (1994) (landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to remedy conditions may breach quiet enjoyment); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982) (upheld finding of breach of quiet enjoyment where landlord failed to remedy serious conditions).

37. The landlord’s duty under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is informed by, and coexists with, the implied warranty of habitability, which incorporates compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 200–01 (1979).

38. Under the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., an owner must maintain the roof, foundation, and exterior walls of a dwelling so as to prevent chronic dampness and water penetration and must keep the building in good repair. 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.550, 410.602.

39. Defendant’s failure, after repeated notice, to repair the leaking ceiling and to correct the resulting damp and musty conditions constitutes a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy rights and her health and safety.

40. The repeated and worsening water intrusion, musty odor, suspected mold, and resulting loss of use of a substantial part of the Premises are not minor, temporary, or trivial inconveniences; they rise to the level of a substantial impairment of the character and value of the tenancy. See *Winbrook Constr. Co. v. Granite State Ins. Co.*, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 848, 850 (1986) (substantial interference standard).

41. Defendant had actual notice of the leaking ceiling from both (a) Plaintiff’s pre‑tenancy inquiry regarding visible water stains and Defendant’s own representation that the problem had been “totally fixed,” and (b) Plaintiff’s multiple subsequent complaints after water again began leaking into the apartment.

42. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant failed and refused to make reasonable and timely repairs or to take effective measures to remediate the conditions, in disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.

43. Defendant’s conduct was at least reckless, if not willful, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, in that he:

   a. Knew or should have known of the continuing leak at the time he rented the Premises to Plaintiff, having been aware of the prior water damage;  
   b. Misrepresented the leak as “totally fixed” during the showing; and  
   c. Dismissed the ongoing leak as merely a “minor cosmetic issue” and attributed the condition to the “character” of the apartment, rather than promptly addressing it.

44. Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that a landlord’s failure to address code violations or unsafe conditions after notice can constitute a willful interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–51; *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983; see also *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994).

45. Defendant’s conduct also violates his obligation, recognized in *Hemingway* and subsequent cases, to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–201; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. at 200–01; *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987).

46. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment:

   a. Plaintiff has suffered property damage, including the loss of a laptop (approximately $900) and damage to her couch;  
   b. Plaintiff has experienced physical symptoms consistent with exposure to damp and musty conditions, including headaches;  
   c. Plaintiff has endured substantial interference with her daily life and her ability to live normally in her home; and  
   d. Plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, humiliation, and inconvenience.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater. Given Plaintiff’s rent of $1,200 per month, three months’ rent equals $3,600.

48. Plaintiff currently estimates her recoverable damages to be at least $1,200 based on the harm she has experienced to date, but under the statute she is entitled to an award of not less than three months’ rent ($3,600) if that amount exceeds her actual and consequential damages proven at trial.

49. G.L. c. 186, § 14 also mandates an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to a prevailing tenant. Although Plaintiff is self‑represented at this time, she seeks her taxable costs and, should she later retain counsel, reasonable attorney’s fees as allowed by law. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 851–52.

50. Plaintiff therefore seeks judgment against Defendant for statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, her actual and consequential damages, and all other relief the Court deems just and proper.
