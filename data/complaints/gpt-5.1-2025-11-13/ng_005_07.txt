COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PROPERTY DAMAGE)  

Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Johnson (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01105.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mark Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01105, and occupies the other unit of the duplex located at that address.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, seeking monetary damages for property damage and related out‑of‑pocket losses.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, thereby conferring subject‑matter jurisdiction on the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4.

5. Venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and § 2 because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Hampden County and both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Hampden County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a duplex located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway on the property.

7. Next to the shared driveway, there is a wooden fence that runs along the boundary adjacent to where Plaintiff regularly parks her vehicle.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder (the “Ladder”).

9. For an extended period of time prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant regularly stored and left the Ladder leaning upright, unsecured, and unsupported against the wooden fence, directly adjacent to and above the area where Plaintiff parked her vehicle.

10. The Ladder, when left leaning upright and unsecured, was inherently unstable and prone to being blown over by wind or otherwise falling due to gravity, posing a foreseeable risk of harm to persons and property in its fall zone, including Plaintiff’s vehicle.

11. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff observed the Ladder leaning against the fence near her parking space and became concerned that it could fall, especially on windy days.

12. On at least two such occasions before March 15, 2023, Plaintiff spoke directly to Defendant and expressed her concerns that the Ladder could fall onto her car, particularly when it was windy.

13. During those conversations, Plaintiff specifically told Defendant that:

   a. She was worried the Ladder might fall over onto her car; and  
   b. Windy conditions at the property made the Ladder particularly dangerous.

14. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would either secure the Ladder (such as by tying it down) or move it to a safer location.

15. Despite these assurances, Defendant failed to tie down, secure, lay flat, remove, or otherwise reasonably stabilize the Ladder, and continued to leave it leaning against the wooden fence in close proximity to Plaintiff’s parking area.

16. Defendant had actual knowledge of:

   a. The Ladder’s size, weight, and instability when left upright and unsecured;  
   b. The windy conditions that regularly occur at the property; and  
   c. Plaintiff’s explicit warnings and complaints that the Ladder might fall and damage her vehicle.

17. Defendant also had constructive knowledge, as a reasonable person would, that an unsecured, tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against a wooden fence near a driveway was likely to fall in windy conditions and cause property damage.

18. On or about March 15, 2023, at approximately 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, it was a windy day, with gusts of wind strong enough to move unsecured outdoor objects.

19. On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and was in the process of backing into the shared driveway to park in her usual space near the fence.

20. At that time and location, the Ladder was still leaning against the wooden fence, unsecured and unfixed, in essentially the same hazardous condition Plaintiff had previously complained about.

21. As Plaintiff backed into the driveway on March 15, 2023, a gust of wind struck the Ladder.

22. The Ladder was not tied down, braced, or otherwise secured, and therefore was unable to withstand the wind gust.

23. As a direct result of the Ladder’s unstable and unsecured condition, the wind gust caused the Ladder to fall away from the fence and down toward the driveway and Plaintiff’s car.

24. The Ladder crashed onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing an impact that:

   a. Dented the hood; and  
   b. Cracked and damaged the windshield.

25. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating her vehicle in a lawful and reasonable manner and had no control over the placement or securing of the Ladder.

26. The Ladder striking the vehicle caused significant property damage to Plaintiff’s car, requiring bodywork and replacement of the windshield.

27. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff’s vehicle had to be taken to an auto repair facility for body repairs and installation of a new windshield.

28. Plaintiff’s vehicle was out of service and unavailable for her regular use for more than one week while repair work was performed.

29. Because her vehicle was unavailable, Plaintiff was forced to rent a car at her own expense to conduct her normal daily activities.

30. Plaintiff also bore the cost of her automobile insurance deductible in order for the repair costs to be covered or processed.

31. Plaintiff paid, and/or became legally obligated to pay, expenses for the property damage to her vehicle, including but not limited to:

   a. The insurance deductible;  
   b. Rental car charges; and  
   c. Any additional repair‑related costs not covered by insurance.

32. Plaintiff did not sustain personal bodily injuries or incur medical expenses or wage loss as a result of this incident, but she did sustain property damage, loss of use, and consequential economic losses.

33. The damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, the loss of its use during repairs, and the rental car and related expenses were the direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in storing and securing the Ladder.

34. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that:

   a. Windy conditions could and did occur in Springfield in March;  
   b. An unsecured ladder leaning upright against a fence near a driveway could easily be blown over by wind; and  
   c. If the Ladder fell, it was likely to strike Plaintiff’s vehicle or otherwise cause damage in the immediate area.

35. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position, knowing of the Ladder’s location and Plaintiff’s explicit warnings and concerns, would have foreseen the risk of harm and would have taken simple, low‑cost steps to prevent the Ladder from falling, such as:

   a. Laying the Ladder flat on the ground when not in use;  
   b. Properly tying or securing the Ladder to a stable structure; or  
   c. Storing the Ladder inside a shed, garage, or other secure area.

36. Defendant failed to take any of these or similar reasonable steps to secure the Ladder before March 15, 2023.

37. Defendant’s conduct in leaving the Ladder leaning against the fence, despite repeated warnings, constituted an unreasonable, careless, and negligent act or omission, in violation of his duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid foreseeable harm to the property of others.

38. Plaintiff did not consent to having her vehicle exposed to unnecessary risk of damage from Defendant’s Ladder, and she reasonably relied on Defendant’s assurances that he would secure or move the Ladder.

39. Plaintiff’s own conduct did not cause or contribute to the Ladder falling; instead, the harm was caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct and failure to act.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:

   a. Property damage to her vehicle;  
   b. Loss of use of her vehicle for more than a week;  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses, including her insurance deductible and rental car costs; and  
   d. Inconvenience, disruption, and loss of enjoyment associated with being deprived of the use of her vehicle.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence (Common‑Law Negligence – Property Damage)**

41. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

42. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others and their property. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (“A person owes a duty of reasonable care to all persons who are foreseeably endangered by his conduct, with respect to all risks which make the conduct unreasonably dangerous.”) (internal quotation omitted).

43. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain and store his Ladder in a safe manner, particularly where the Ladder was located in close proximity to Plaintiff’s parking area and shared driveway.

44. Defendant’s duty included, but was not limited to, a duty to take reasonable precautions to secure the Ladder so that it would not fall and damage Plaintiff’s property, in light of:

   a. The foreseeable risk of the Ladder falling, especially in windy conditions; and  
   b. Plaintiff’s specific warnings that the Ladder posed a danger to her vehicle.

45. Under Massachusetts law, those who control property or instrumentalities located on or adjacent to areas where others reasonably may be expected to go must act with reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm. See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995) (duty to take reasonable steps to prevent harm from foreseeable risks on or near premises); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 61 (1983) (duty arises from foreseeability of harm and reasonableness of protective measures).

46. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of the Ladder, had a duty under Massachusetts law to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances. *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (discussing general negligence standard); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 284 (adopted and cited favorably in Massachusetts cases).

**Breach**

47. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Storing and leaving the Ladder upright and leaning unsecured against the wooden fence adjacent to the shared driveway;  
   b. Failing to tie, secure, brace, or otherwise stabilize the Ladder to prevent it from falling;  
   c. Failing to lay the Ladder flat or store it in a location where it could not fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle;  
   d. Ignoring Plaintiff’s explicit warnings and concerns that the Ladder might fall onto her car, especially in windy weather; and  
   e. Failing to take reasonable and minimal steps that a prudent person would have taken to prevent the Ladder from falling and causing damage.

48. The risk that the Ladder would be blown over by wind and strike Plaintiff’s vehicle was clear and foreseeable. Under Massachusetts negligence law, failure to take simple precautions against such a foreseeable risk constitutes a breach of the duty of care. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (reasonable care requires measures commensurate with foreseeable risk); *Flood v. Southland Corp.*, 416 Mass. 62, 72 (1993) (breach where reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm were not taken).

49. Defendant’s assurances that he would tie down or move the Ladder, followed by his failure to do so, underscore that he recognized the risk yet unreasonably failed to address it. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 150–51 (failure to take readily available steps to prevent foreseeable harm supports finding of negligence).

50. Defendant’s conduct created an unreasonable and unnecessary danger to Plaintiff’s property and fell below the standard of care exercised by an ordinarily prudent person in the same or similar circumstances.

**Causation**

51. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of the Ladder falling and striking Plaintiff’s vehicle on March 15, 2023.

52. But for Defendant’s failure to secure, tie down, move, or properly store the Ladder, the Ladder would not have fallen onto Plaintiff’s car, and her vehicle would not have been damaged.

53. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that, if the Ladder were left leaning upright and unsecured near the driveway, wind could cause it to fall and damage Plaintiff’s vehicle. See *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37, 45 (2009) (defendant liable where risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable and occurred in a natural and continuous sequence); *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 148 (foreseeability of harm is central to duty and causation).

54. The falling of an unsecured ladder in windy conditions, striking property located directly in its fall path, is the very type of harm that made Defendant’s conduct unreasonably dangerous in the first place.

55. No act or omission of Plaintiff, nor any superseding or intervening cause, severed the causal chain between Defendant’s negligence and the harm to Plaintiff’s property.

**Damages**

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered legally compensable damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Physical damage to her vehicle, including a dented hood and cracked windshield, requiring repair and replacement of parts;  
   b. Loss of use of her vehicle for more than a week while it was being repaired;  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses, including the payment of her automobile insurance deductible;  
   d. Rental car charges incurred to maintain necessary transportation during the repair period; and  
   e. Other incidental expenses and inconvenience associated with the damage and loss of use.

57. Massachusetts law allows a plaintiff to recover for property damage, loss of use, and consequential economic losses caused by another’s negligence. See *Guaranty-First Trust Co. v. Textron, Inc.*, 416 Mass. 332, 336 (1993) (recognizing recovery for property damage and consequential economic loss in negligence); *Santos v. Chrysler Corp.*, 430 Mass. 198, 203–04 (1999) (damages in negligence include costs directly resulting from the negligent act).

58. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s recovery is not barred or reduced by comparative negligence because Plaintiff did not act unreasonably and did not contribute to the Ladder’s fall; Defendant’s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the damage.

59. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, Plaintiff is entitled to recover prejudgment interest on her damages at the statutory rate from the date of commencement of this action, as well as post‑judgment interest.

60. Under G.L. c. 231, § 60D and prevailing Massachusetts common law, Plaintiff is further entitled to recover her taxable costs of suit.

61. Plaintiff estimates, upon information and belief, that her total damages, including property damage, deductible, rental car and other incidental expenses, and interest, exceed $25,000.

---

### V. APPLICABLE LAW AND AUTHORITIES

62. Plaintiff’s claim for negligence is grounded in Massachusetts common law and statutes, including but not limited to:

   a. General principles of negligence articulated in *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006);  
   b. The duty to exercise reasonable care where harm is foreseeable, as discussed in *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983);  
   c. Premises‑related and instrumentality‑related duties as in *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995), and *Flood v. Southland Corp.*, 416 Mass. 62 (1993);  
   d. Standards of breach and reasonableness, e.g., *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996), and *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000);  
   e. Causation and foreseeability principles from *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37 (2009);  
   f. Recoverable damages in negligence, including property and consequential losses, as in *Guaranty-First Trust Co. v. Textron, Inc.*, 416 Mass. 332 (1993), and *Santos v. Chrysler Corp.*, 430 Mass. 198 (1999); and  
   g. Statutory provisions including G.L. c. 212, § 4 (Superior Court jurisdiction), G.L. c. 223, §§ 1–2 (venue), G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence), and G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B–6C, 60D (interest and costs).

63. Collectively, these authorities support Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant owed and breached a duty of reasonable care, that Defendant’s breach foreseeably caused Plaintiff’s property damage, and that Plaintiff is entitled to full compensation for her resulting losses.
