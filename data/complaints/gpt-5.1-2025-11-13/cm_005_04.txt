COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell (“Sara” or “Plaintiff”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Kyle Thompson (“Kyle” or “Defendant”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emma Thompson and Liam Thompson.

2. The Defendant, Kyle Thompson, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children, Emma Thompson and Liam Thompson.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, and 31; G.L. c. 209C, to the extent applicable; and the Court’s inherent and statutory authority to enter and modify custody and parenting-time orders concerning minor children.

4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody Judgment/Order was entered in this Court, the minor children reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and substantial connections to this county exist. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 208, § 6; G.L. c. 223, § 1.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT/ORDER

5. On or about March 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment/Order (the “2022 Order”) establishing custody and parenting-time arrangements for the parties’ minor children, Emma Thompson (born approximately 2015; presently age 10) and Liam Thompson (born approximately 2017; presently age 8).

6. Under the 2022 Order, the parties were awarded joint legal custody of the minor children, with the children’s primary residence with the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, and the Defendant, Kyle Thompson, having parenting time on alternating weekends and such other times as set forth in the 2022 Order.

7. The 2022 Order also requires each parent to support and foster the children’s relationship with the other parent and to refrain from disparaging or undermining the other parent in the presence of the children.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2022 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the children’s best interests, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 31.

9. Under Massachusetts law, an existing custody and parenting-time order may be modified when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

10. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that the “polar star” and “overriding concern” of the Probate and Family Court in custody matters is the best interests of the child. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998); *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755, 766–67 (1983).

11. Since approximately 2024 and continuing to the present, the Defendant has engaged in a pattern of conduct that interferes with the Plaintiff’s parenting time, undermines the Plaintiff’s relationship with the children, and causes emotional distress to the children, including but not limited to:

   a. Unilaterally enrolling the children in extracurricular activities and events that occur during the Plaintiff’s scheduled weekends and parenting time without prior consultation or mutual agreement, despite the parties’ joint legal custody and the 2022 Order’s requirements;

   b. Informing the children, expressly or by implication, that if they do not attend such activities during the Plaintiff’s weekends, it is because the Plaintiff is “selfish” or because the Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” enough to allow them to attend;

   c. Blaming the Plaintiff to the children when the Plaintiff requests or needs to swap weekends or adjust the schedule to accommodate the children’s or the parties’ needs, rather than communicating directly and respectfully with the Plaintiff;

   d. Making disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff in the presence of the children, including but not limited to statements that the Plaintiff is “selfish” and suggesting that the Plaintiff does not truly care for or love the children.

12. The Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that the children have repeatedly reported these statements and behaviors by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. The children have expressed confusion and emotional upset about the conflicting messages they receive from the Defendant concerning the Plaintiff’s care and love for them.

13. At least one of the children has begun experiencing frequent stomach aches and somatic complaints on or around transition days between households, which coincides with the ongoing conflict and disparagement described above. These physical symptoms are reasonably attributable to stress and anxiety associated with transitions and the conflict between the parents as expressed in front of the children.

14. The Defendant’s unilateral decision-making regarding extracurricular activities during the Plaintiff’s parenting time is inconsistent with the parties’ joint legal custody, which obligates them to share in major decisions affecting the children’s welfare and to cooperate in parenting decisions. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 708–09 (1985) (discussing joint custody and the need for cooperation); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006).

15. The Defendant’s disparaging comments and his practice of blaming the Plaintiff in front of the children for scheduling disagreements is contrary to the 2022 Order, contrary to the children’s best interests, and inconsistent with the requirement that each parent foster and encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 815–16 (1981) (parent’s willingness to foster relationship with the other parent is a significant factor in custody); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–06 (1981).

16. The Defendant’s conduct constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances from those that existed at the time of the 2022 Order, because:

   a. The parties’ ability to cooperate in joint legal custody has significantly deteriorated;  

   b. The Defendant is not supporting the Plaintiff’s relationship with the children, and is instead undermining it;  

   c. The children are manifesting emotional and physical signs of stress associated with the parental conflict and transitions;  

   d. The current order lacks sufficient clarity about decision-making authority and scheduling, which has enabled ongoing conflict and confusion for the children.

17. Massachusetts law recognizes that when the parties’ inability to cooperate on significant parenting issues or one parent’s interference with the other’s relationship with the children materially affects the children’s welfare, modification of custody may be appropriate. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976) (material change in circumstances standard); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (modification based on post-judgment parental conduct).

18. The best interests of the children require that their primary residence continue with the Plaintiff and that decision-making authority and parenting-time provisions be clarified and modified so as to:

   a. Reduce conflict;  

   b. Protect the children from exposure to disparaging remarks and blame;  

   c. Establish clear rules regarding scheduling and extracurricular activities; and  

   d. Ensure that the children’s emotional and physical health is preserved.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

19. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, this Court must determine custody and parenting time in accordance with the best interests of the children, taking into account, among other factors, the children’s past and present living conditions, the relationship of the children with each parent, and each parent’s willingness and ability to foster a positive relationship between the children and the other parent. See also *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

20. The Plaintiff has been the children’s primary residential parent in accordance with the 2022 Order. The children’s routines, schooling, and daily care have been primarily situated in the Plaintiff’s household, and the children have thrived in that environment.

21. The Plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to comply with the 2022 Order, including supporting the children’s relationship with the Defendant and attempting to manage scheduling requests and extracurricular activities in a cooperative manner.

22. The Defendant’s repeated disparagement of the Plaintiff and his pattern of placing the burden of adult scheduling disagreements onto the children (by telling them it is the Plaintiff’s “fault” when they cannot attend certain activities) are harmful to the children’s emotional well-being and stability.

23. The emotional distress evidenced by the children’s reports and one child’s stomach aches on transition days indicates that the current parenting-time and decision-making dynamic is having an adverse impact on the children’s welfare.

24. Massachusetts appellate decisions emphasize the importance of maintaining the child’s emotional health and continuity of care, and of considering each parent’s ability to place the child’s needs above interpersonal conflict. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 845–47; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96; *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 815–16.

25. It is in the best interests of Emma and Liam that:

   a. Their primary residence remain with the Plaintiff;  

   b. The Plaintiff be granted final decision-making authority with respect to the scheduling of extracurricular activities and other non-emergency events that may affect the Plaintiff’s parenting time, after reasonable consultation with the Defendant;  

   c. The parenting-time schedule be clarified so that activities scheduled during a parent’s time require that parent’s reasonable advance consent or agreement; and  

   d. The Court enter explicit non-disparagement and communication provisions to protect the children from being caught in parental conflict.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

26. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the 2022 Order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 208, § 31, and applicable caselaw (*Custody of Vaughn*, *Mason v. Coleman*, *Custody of Kali*, *Rolde v. Rolde*, *Hale v. Hale*), to reflect the material change in circumstances and to serve the best interests of the children.

27. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an order including, but not limited to, the following provisions:

   a. **Custody / Legal Decision-Making**  
      i. The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody in name, but with the Plaintiff having final decision-making authority regarding the children’s extracurricular schedules and other non-emergency activities that affect the Plaintiff’s parenting time, after good-faith consultation with the Defendant.  
      ii. In the alternative, to the extent the Court finds the parties’ inability to cooperate renders joint legal custody contrary to the children’s best interests, the Plaintiff requests that she be awarded sole legal custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31.

   b. **Primary Residence**  
      i. The children’s primary residence shall remain with the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell.  
      ii. The Court shall reaffirm and clarify that the children reside primarily with the Plaintiff and that all school-related documents, medical records, and activity registrations shall list the Plaintiff’s address as the primary residence, unless otherwise required by law.

   c. **Parenting Time Schedule**  
      i. The Defendant shall continue to exercise parenting time on alternating weekends, from a specified time on Friday to a specified time on Sunday (or such other schedule as the Court finds appropriate), provided such time is exercised in a manner consistent with this modified order and the children’s best interests.  
      ii. Any proposed changes to parenting time, including swaps of weekends or additional days, shall be discussed directly between the parties and not through the children.  
      iii. Each parent shall give the other reasonable advance written or electronic notice of any activity or event that may affect the existing parenting-time schedule.

   d. **Extracurricular Activities and Scheduling**  
      i. No parent shall unilaterally enroll the children in recurring extracurricular activities, lessons, practices, or events that are scheduled during the other parent’s regular parenting time without first obtaining the other parent’s written or electronic consent.  
      ii. When a new extracurricular activity is proposed that will fall, in whole or in part, during the other parent’s time, the proposing parent shall:  
         1. Provide written notice of the proposed activity, including schedule, duration, cost, and transportation needs; and  
         2. Make good-faith efforts to select days and times that minimize interference with the other parent’s parenting time.  
      iii. If the parents are unable to agree on an activity that significantly interferes with one parent’s parenting time, the Plaintiff’s decision shall be final (if joint legal custody with final decision-making authority to the Plaintiff is ordered), subject to further order of the Court.

   e. **Non-Disparagement and Communications**  
      i. Neither parent shall disparage, demean, or criticize the other parent in the presence or hearing of the children, including but not limited to statements that the other parent is “selfish,” does not love the children, or is otherwise to blame for adult scheduling or court-ordered arrangements.  
      ii. Neither parent shall communicate to the children that the other parent is at fault if an extracurricular event is not attended or if a schedule change cannot be accommodated; instead, the parents shall discuss such issues directly with each other, out of the children’s presence.  
      iii. Each parent shall encourage and support the children’s relationship with the other parent and shall not attempt to alienate the children from the other parent. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

   f. **Health and Emotional Well-Being**  
      i. Both parents shall cooperate in addressing any physical or emotional symptoms that may be related to transitions or parental conflict, including but not limited to arranging appropriate medical or counseling services if recommended by the children’s pediatrician or a qualified mental health professional.  
      ii. Each parent shall promptly inform the other of any medical, psychological, or counseling appointments for the children and shall provide the other parent with access to relevant records and providers, consistent with joint custody and the children’s best interests.

   g. **Compliance with Court Orders**  
      i. Both parents shall strictly comply with the modified order and with all prior orders not specifically modified herein.  
      ii. The Court may incorporate by reference any provisions of the 2022 Order that are not inconsistent with the modifications requested herein.

28. These requested modifications are reasonable, necessary, and designed to reduce conflict, safeguard the children’s emotional and physical well-being, and protect and promote the children’s relationship with both parents in a manner consistent with the best interests standard under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and related caselaw.

### VII. LEGAL BASIS

29. The Plaintiff’s Complaint for Modification is brought under and supported by, inter alia, the following statutory and case authorities:

   e. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (standard for modification; best interests; effect of parental conduct);  
   f. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (joint custody requires cooperation; modification appropriate when cooperation breaks down and child’s best interests are affected);  
   g. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best-interests analysis; importance of stability and emotional well-being);  
   h. *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1034 (1999) (best interests as paramount consideration);  
   i. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (parent’s willingness to foster child’s relationship with other parent is critical);

   2. Maintain and clarify the Defendant’s parenting time on alternating weekends (and such additional time as the Court deems appropriate) subject to terms that protect the children from exposure to conflict and disparagement;
