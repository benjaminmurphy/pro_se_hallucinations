COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time judgment, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, is an individual who resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Miller.

2. The Defendant, Kevin Miller (“Father”), is an individual who resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Emily Miller.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - Emily Miller, born __________ (presently age 10).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time concerning the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, because the original custody and parenting time judgment was issued by this Court on or about May 15, 2018.

5. Norfolk Probate and Family Court is the proper venue because the prior judgment was entered here and the child and both parents reside within this Court’s jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2018 Judgment”) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child, Emily Miller.

7. Under the 2018 Judgment, primary physical custody/residence of the minor child was awarded to Father, with Mother having limited parenting time consisting of weekend visits and one weeknight dinner each week.

8. The 2018 Judgment and parenting schedule were based on the circumstances that existed at the time, including:

   a. Mother was then enrolled in graduate school and had a demanding academic schedule with limited flexibility;

   b. Mother was living in a small studio apartment that was not well-suited for frequent or extended overnight parenting time;

   c. Mother’s limited schedule and housing situation constrained her ability to exercise more extensive custodial time; and

   d. The parties and the Court agreed that, at that time, primary residence with Father and limited contact with Mother was in the child’s best interests.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child, such that the existing custody and parenting time provisions are no longer appropriate. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (1989).

10. Massachusetts law provides that a custody or parenting time order “may be modified if the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.” G.L. c. 208, § 28; see also *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 150 (2015).

11. Since 2018, Mother has completed her graduate education. She is no longer a student and is not constrained by the academic and practicum schedule that formed a critical basis for the 2018 Judgment. This is a material change in circumstance. See *Schuh v. Schuh*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 504–05 (1989) (post-judgment changes in parent’s work and life circumstances can support modification).

12. Mother now has a stable, long‑term job with normal, predictable hours. Her employment does not require irregular or late-night work, and she is generally available during after‑school and evening hours. This is a significant change from the schedule and uncertainty that existed at the time of the 2018 Judgment, and it directly affects her ability to assume more parenting responsibility and provide a stable routine for the minor child. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85 (stability and parental availability are central to best‑interests analysis).

13. Mother now lives in a two‑bedroom apartment, and the minor child has her own designated bedroom in Mother’s home. This is a substantial improvement from Mother’s former small studio apartment, which limited the practicality and comfort of overnight contact. A parent’s improved and appropriate housing for the child is a material change relevant to custody and parenting time. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262–63 (2001) (modification supported by changes in living situation and child’s adjustment).

14. Over the intervening years, Mother and the minor child have formed a strong, close, and positive relationship. The minor child is now ten years old and developmentally more mature than at age four. The nature and quality of the parent‑child relationship, as well as the child’s increasing age and evolving needs, constitute a material change that warrants reconsideration of the parenting schedule. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711–12 (1985) (best interests turn on child’s relationship with each parent and the child’s adjustment); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 151–52 (changes in child’s needs and relationships since prior judgment relevant to modification).

15. The minor child has been in therapy. According to the child’s therapist, the child reports feeling guilty and upset when she must leave Mother’s home after only short visits, and she has expressed a desire to spend more time and more overnights with Mother. The child’s emotional response to the current schedule and her therapeutic needs are new circumstances that did not exist at the time of the 2018 Judgment.

16. The minor child has written a letter to the Court, addressed to the judge, stating that she wants more overnights at Mother’s residence. While the child’s wishes are not controlling, Massachusetts law recognizes that the Court may consider a reasonably mature child’s preferences as one factor among many in determining best interests. See *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981) (child’s preference may be considered where child has reached an appropriate age and maturity); *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 616–17 (1987) (similar).

17. The minor child’s stated wish to spend more overnight time with Mother, combined with the therapeutic evidence that the child feels distress and guilt over limited time with Mother, are material, post‑judgment developments bearing directly on the child’s well‑being and best interests. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003) (emotional well‑being and continuity of care are central to best‑interests analysis).

18. Father refuses to discuss any meaningful modification of the current schedule despite the marked changes in Mother’s circumstances and the child’s expressed wishes. Father reportedly becomes angry when the child raises her desire to spend more time with Mother, which places the child in a loyalty conflict and negatively impacts her emotional welfare.

19. Mother’s circumstances have changed from being a graduate student with minimal flexibility and limited housing to being a fully employed, stably housed parent with appropriate space and availability to care for the minor child on an expanded and consistent basis.

20. The material changes since the 2018 Judgment include, but are not limited to:

   a. Mother’s completion of graduate school and exit from the intense academic program on which the original schedule was based;

   b. Mother’s stable employment and predictable work hours, allowing greater day‑to‑day availability to the child;

   c. Mother’s improved housing in a two‑bedroom apartment, including a separate bedroom for the child;

   d. The child’s increased age (from four to ten), maturity, and evolving developmental needs;

   e. The strengthened relationship between Mother and the child over the years;

   f. The child’s therapy and therapeutic reports concerning the emotional strain of limited contact with Mother;

   g. The child’s written statement to the Court expressing a desire for more overnights and time with Mother; and

   h. Father’s refusal to consider reasonable changes in parenting time in light of the above developments.

21. Collectively and individually, these changes are substantial, material, and were not contemplated at the time of the 2018 Judgment. They directly impact the child’s welfare and make the existing custody and parenting time arrangement no longer consistent with the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. at 504–05; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–63.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

22. Under Massachusetts law, the guiding standard for any order concerning custody and parenting time is the “best interests of the child.” G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

23. In determining the best interests of the child, the Court considers factors such as:

   a. The child’s age, needs, and emotional development;

   b. The child’s relationship with each parent;

   c. The capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s emotional, educational, and physical needs;

   d. The stability of each parent’s home environment and schedule;

   e. The effect of any proposed change on the child’s stability and continuity of care; and

   f. Where appropriate, the child’s reasonable preference.  
   See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43; *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704, 711 (1984); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

24. The requested modification will advance the child’s best interests by:

   a. Allowing the child to benefit from a fuller, more consistent relationship with Mother, with whom she has become very close;

   b. Reducing the child’s feelings of guilt, distress, and emotional conflict associated with brief, limited visits;

   c. Providing the child with a stable, appropriate residence and her own bedroom in Mother’s home during additional overnights;

   d. Respecting and appropriately considering the child’s expressed wishes for more overnight time with Mother, consistent with her age and maturity; and

   e. Maintaining Father as a significant and involved parent while better balancing the child’s time between both parents.

25. Mother does not seek to disrupt the child’s relationship with Father or to exclude him from the child’s life. Rather, Mother seeks a modification that reflects current realities and the child’s needs, and that is consistent with Massachusetts’ policy favoring the active involvement of both parents when safe and appropriate. See G.L. c. 208, § 31 (joint responsibility and frequent and continuing contact with both parents where in child’s best interest).

26. A modification that increases Mother’s parenting time, including overnights and meaningful weekday time, will promote the child’s emotional security, sense of belonging, and overall welfare. See *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 151–52; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–63.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

27. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Judgment to reflect the material changes in circumstances and to serve the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to:

   a. Re‑allocation of physical custody/parenting time so that the child has substantially increased and regular parenting time with Mother, including additional weekends and weeknight overnights at Mother’s residence;

   b. A parenting schedule that, at minimum, provides for:

      i. Emily spending alternating weekends from Friday after school (or at 5:00 p.m.) through Monday morning drop‑off at school (or 9:00 a.m. during non‑school times) with Mother; and  

      ii. At least one (1) regular weeknight overnight with Mother each school week (for example, from after school or 5:00 p.m. to school drop‑off the following morning), with additional school‑vacation and summer time as is in her best interests;

   c. Such further adjustment to weekday, holiday, vacation, and summer schedules as the Court finds appropriate to ensure that Emily has frequent, meaningful, and ongoing contact with Mother in light of Mother’s improved circumstances and the child’s wishes;

   d. Confirmation that both parents shall continue to share legal responsibility for major decisions regarding the child’s health, education, and welfare, unless and until the Court determines otherwise pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31; and

   e. Any additional orders that the Court deems necessary to safeguard the child’s emotional and psychological well‑being, including but not limited to appropriate communication protocols between the parents concerning the child and her therapy.

28. Mother’s requested modification is narrowly tailored to the current realities of the parties and the child, consistent with the statutory requirement that modifications be based on material and substantial change and the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–85; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44.

### VII. LEGAL BASIS

29. The Court’s authority to modify a prior custody and parenting time order derives from G.L. c. 208, § 28, which provides that upon a material and substantial change in circumstances, the Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the minor children.”

30. The Court further has general equity jurisdiction in domestic relations matters concerning the care, custody, maintenance, and support of minor children under G.L. c. 215, § 6.

31. The standards articulated in *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Schuh v. Schuh*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (1989); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); and *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984), support the proposition that changed circumstances concerning the parents’ capacities, the child’s age and wishes, and the child’s emotional needs justify a modification of custody and parenting time where necessary to protect and advance the child’s best interests.

32. Applying these authorities to the facts here, Mother has demonstrated:

   a. A material and substantial change in her employment, housing, and life stability since the 2018 Judgment;

   b. A material change in the child’s age, developmental needs, therapeutic needs, and expressed wishes;

   c. That the existing arrangement, which was tailored to Mother’s former limitations, no longer reflects current realities or best serves the child’s emotional and developmental welfare; and

   d. That a modification to increase Mother’s parenting time and overnights is necessary and in the child’s best interests.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2018 Judgment concerning custody and parenting time for Emily Miller;

2. Modify the existing custody and parenting time provisions of the May 15, 2018 Judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, so as to provide the minor child with substantially increased parenting time and overnights with Mother, including but not limited to alternating weekends and at least one additional weeknight overnight each school week, together with appropriate holiday, vacation, and summer schedules;

3. Order that the modified custody and parenting plan be structured to promote the child’s emotional well‑being, stability, and strong relationships with both parents, and to account for the child’s therapeutic needs and expressed preferences, to the extent consistent with her best interests;

4. Order such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

Jessica Miller  
Plaintiff, pro se
