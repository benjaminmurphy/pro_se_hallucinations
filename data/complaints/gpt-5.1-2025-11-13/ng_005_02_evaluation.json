Although the case arises under G.L. c. 21E, the court explicitly incorporates and applies the common-law measure of damages in negligence/property damage cases, confirming that property damage and loss-of-use damages are recoverable when proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct. The proposition is thus accurately supported, with the caveat that such loss-of-use damages are limited to the reasonable repair period.",
