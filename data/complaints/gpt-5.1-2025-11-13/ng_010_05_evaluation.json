      "support_reasoning": "The case holds that, where a dangerous condition is open and obvious to a person of average intelligence, the landowner has no duty to warn or otherwise protect against it. Here, the SJC found the defendants owed no duty to warn or remedy the risk of diving into the shallow end because that danger was open and obvious, and therefore there was no breach. That directly contradicts the proposition that failure to remedy or warn of a known dangerous condition in these circumstances constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care.",

L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, does not alter the plaintiff\u2019s burden in a negligence action to prove that the defendant owed him a duty of care in the circumstances, and thus leaves intact the open and obvious danger rule, which operates to negate the existence of a duty of care\u2026 We conclude that, because the danger of diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool is open and obvious\u2026 the defendants had no duty to warn the plaintiff of this danger as a matter of law.\u201d"
