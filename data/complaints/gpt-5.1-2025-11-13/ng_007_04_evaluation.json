The discussion of capacity and awareness of risk is limited to whether these teens were \u2018too immature\u2019 to appreciate danger for purposes of trespasser exceptions, and the court expressly notes plaintiffs admitted they were not such immature children. The opinion therefore does not provide authority for the proposition that an eight\u2011year\u2011old cannot be held to an adult standard of care or did not act unreasonably.",

The court rejects any special control requirement for physicians and states that, once employment is shown, the only remaining question is whether the act was within the scope of employment\u2014precisely matching the proposition that the defendant is liable for the negligence of its employees acting within the course and scope of their employment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo prevail against BMA, the plaintiffs need only establish that (1) at the time of the alleged negligence Dr. Schlitzer was an employee of BMA, and (2) the alleged negligent treatment of the plaintiff occurred within the scope of Dr. Schlitzer\u2019s employment by BMA. Once employment is established, the only remaining issue is whether he was working for BMA at the time of the alleged negligent treatment, i.e., whether his treatment of the plaintiff was within the scope of his employment by BMA. This comports with traditional agency law that \u2018[a]n employer is liable for torts committed by employees while acting in the scope of their employment.\u2019\u201d"
