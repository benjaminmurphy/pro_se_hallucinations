v.

Docket No. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time)  

Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett (“Mother”), respectfully states as follows:

1. This is a Complaint for Modification brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Court’s equitable powers, seeking modification of an existing custody and parenting-time judgment relating to the minor child of the parties.

2. The parties are the parents of the following minor child:  
   - Sophie Carter, age 9.

3. The Middlesex Probate and Family Court entered a custody and parenting-time judgment (or order) on June 15, 2021 (the “2021 Judgment”), in which Mother was granted primary physical custody of Sophie, and Father, David Carter (“Father”), was granted parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend.

4. At the time the 2021 Judgment was entered, both parties resided in the Cambridge area of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, in close geographic proximity to each other and to Sophie’s school and activities.

5. The parenting-time schedule set forth in the 2021 Judgment was structured and approved on the express and implicit assumption that the parties and the minor child would continue to reside in reasonably close proximity to one another, so that the midweek overnight and alternating weekend schedule would not unduly burden the child’s schooling, extracurricular activities, or emotional well‑being.

6. Father has now decided to relocate his residence to the State of New Hampshire for a job opportunity, substantially increasing the travel distance and time between his home and the child’s home, school, and established community in Massachusetts.

7. Mother is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that the drive time between Father’s anticipated New Hampshire residence and the child’s home and school in the Cambridge area will be approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in normal traffic conditions, and potentially longer during peak commuting times.

8. Father seeks to maintain the existing parenting-time schedule, including the midweek Wednesday overnight, notwithstanding this substantial increase in distance and travel time.

9. If the existing midweek overnight is maintained after Father relocates to New Hampshire, Sophie would be required to undertake long, late-evening and early‑morning drives on school nights, and to wake up significantly earlier than usual, in order to attend school in Massachusetts the next morning.

10. The extended travel time and disruption to Sophie’s weekday routine would interfere with her regular sleep schedule, her homework and study time, and her ability to participate in after‑school and extracurricular activities that are important to her development and social life.

11. Mother has observed that Sophie has already begun to exhibit anxiety and distress regarding the prospect of long drives to New Hampshire on school nights and missing after‑school activities, and she has verbalized her worries about this anticipated schedule.

12. The increased distance, travel time, anxiety, and interference with Sophie’s schooling and activities constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2021 Judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, including Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) and Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

13. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 28; Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507, 509–510 (2013); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–844 (2003).

14. The best interests of the child standard is paramount and requires consideration of the child’s emotional, physical, and developmental needs, including continuity, stability, and the minimization of conflict and stress. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–226 (1998); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595.

15. A parenting-time schedule which requires a nine‑year‑old child to travel approximately ninety minutes each way on a school night, and to awaken significantly earlier than usual to commute back to school, is inconsistent with the child’s stability and routine and is not in her best interests.

16. The law recognizes that substantial changes in residence or distance between households, even where the child’s primary residence does not change, can constitute a material change in circumstances justifying modification of parenting time. See, e.g., Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183–184 (2006); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261–262 (2001); Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 868–869 (2006).

17. Father’s relocation to another state, combined with his insistence on maintaining a midweek overnight schedule that no longer reflects the geographic reality of the parties’ homes, is a significant change from the situation that existed when the 2021 Judgment was entered.

18. Since the entry of the 2021 Judgment, Mother has continued to provide a stable primary residence and routine for Sophie, ensuring regular school attendance, participation in after‑school activities, and consistent medical, emotional, and educational support.

19. Mother does not seek to interfere with or unreasonably restrict the relationship between Sophie and Father. Rather, Mother seeks to adjust the schedule to reflect the new distance between the households in a way that is workable and developmentally appropriate, and that gives reasonable and meaningful parenting time to Father without compromising the child’s welfare.

20. Massachusetts courts regularly recognize that parenting-time orders should be tailored to the realities of the parties’ circumstances and to the evolving needs of the child, and should be modified where necessary to protect the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Morales, 464 Mass. at 510–511; Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 333–334 (2007); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 403–404 (1981).

21. The child’s best interests are served by a schedule that limits long-distance travel to non‑school days to the greatest extent feasible, keeps school nights predictable and minimally stressful, and supports the child’s connection to her school and community.

22. The present midweek overnight schedule, if continued after Father’s relocation, will likely result in increased fatigue, stress, and emotional upset for Sophie, and could adversely affect her academic performance and her ability to maintain friendships and participate fully in her activities.

23. Maintaining the current midweek overnight arrangement in the face of Father’s significant move would effectively transform an arrangement that once was in the child’s best interests into one that is unduly burdensome and contrary to her welfare, which is precisely the kind of changed circumstance that justifies modification under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related authority. See, e.g., Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596; Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 151–152 (2015).

24. Mother therefore seeks a modification of the 2021 Judgment to:  
    a. Remove the midweek (Wednesday) overnight from Father’s parenting time once Father relocates to New Hampshire or otherwise moves to a residence that requires significant long‑distance travel (approximately ninety minutes or more each way) between his home and the child’s home/school; and  
    b. Adjust Father’s weekend parenting time to a schedule that is more practical given the increased distance, while preserving frequent and meaningful contact between Father and Sophie.

25. Mother proposes, by way of example and without limitation, that Father have parenting time on alternate weekends from Friday after school (or at a time reasonably agreed upon by the parties) until Sunday at a time that allows the child to return home at a reasonable hour in preparation for school on Monday, together with such school‑vacation, holiday, and summertime parenting time as may be ordered by the Court consistent with Sophie’s best interests.

26. Mother’s requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific harms posed by midweek long‑distance travel on school nights, while still facilitating an ongoing and meaningful relationship between Sophie and Father.

27. The requested modification does not alter Mother’s primary physical custody of Sophie, nor does it diminish Father’s legal relationship to the child; it merely realigns the parenting-time schedule with the child’s developmental needs and the parties’ changed geographic circumstances.

28. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must consider, among other factors, the child’s past and present living conditions, the child’s relationship with each parent, the child’s adjustment to home, school and community, and the capacity of each parent to provide a stable environment. The evidence will show that the current midweek schedule, in light of Father’s move, undermines Sophie’s adjustment to school and community and her need for stability.

29. The Supreme Judicial Court has emphasized that continuity, security, and predictability in a child’s routine are central to the best-interests analysis. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–845; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–227. The continuation of a midweek overnight requiring extended interstate travel is incompatible with these principles for a nine‑year‑old child.

30. The Appeals Court has similarly recognized that parenting-time orders must be realistic and workable, and when changed circumstances make an existing schedule impractical or harmful to the child’s welfare, modification is appropriate. See, e.g., Abbott, 68 Mass. App. Ct. at 333–334; Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 900–901.

31. To the extent necessary, Mother also invokes the Court’s authority under G.L. c. 215, § 6 to make such orders in equity as justice and the best interests of the child require.

32. Mother has acted in good faith and in accordance with the prior judgment, and brings this Complaint solely to protect Sophie’s welfare and best interests in light of the changed circumstances caused by Father’s decision to relocate out of state.

33. It is in the best interests of Sophie Carter that the existing custody and parenting-time order be modified in the manner requested herein.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the June 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time judgment, specifically including, but not limited to, Father’s relocation to New Hampshire (or other distant residence) and the resulting burdens on the child’s school‑night routine, travel, activities, and emotional well‑being;

B. Find and rule that modification of the existing parenting-time schedule is in the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Carter;

C. Modify the June 15, 2021 Judgment to eliminate Father’s midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time once Father relocates to New Hampshire or to any residence that requires long-distance travel (approximately ninety minutes or more each way) between his home and the child’s home/school;

D. Modify the June 15, 2021 Judgment to provide that Father shall have parenting time on alternating weekends, from Friday after school (or at a mutually agreed time) until Sunday at a time that reasonably allows the child to prepare for school the following day, and to award such additional holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time as the Court deems appropriate and consistent with Sophie’s best interests;

E. Order that the parties confer in good faith regarding a specific, detailed parenting‑time schedule (including holiday and vacation schedules) consistent with the Court’s findings and orders, and submit a proposed written parenting plan for the Court’s approval, if the Court so directs;

F. Grant such further relief, temporary or permanent, at law or in equity, as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Dated: December 1, 2025  

Respectfully submitted,
