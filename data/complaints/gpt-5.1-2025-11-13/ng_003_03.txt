### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Marcus Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Home Goods Emporium, Inc. (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Marcus Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on Defendant’s premises located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Home Goods Emporium, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of a state of the United States, doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and operating a retail home-goods store at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, controlled, managed, and/or maintained the premises at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Store”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising from negligence under Massachusetts law.

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court, Lowell Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the Store where the incident occurred is located in Lowell, Middlesex County.

7. At all times relevant, Defendant regularly conducted business in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, including operating the Store at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff entered Defendant’s Store at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, as a customer to shop for kitchen goods.

9. Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on the premises, to whom Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Store, and to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition.  
   See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).

10. Defendant, through its employees, agents, and/or servants, had arranged and stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens, on shelving units in the aisle where Plaintiff was shopping.

11. The boxes of appliances were stacked approximately five to six boxes high on the shelves, creating a tall and unstable column of heavy merchandise.

12. The boxes were stacked without the use of any safety straps, rails, barriers, netting, or other restraining devices designed to prevent merchandise from falling into the aisle.

13. The stacked boxes were placed in such a manner that ordinary and foreseeable forces—such as a customer pushing or bumping a shopping cart—could cause the boxes to become unstable and fall.

14. On September 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was looking at kitchen items on one of the shelves, another customer pushed a shopping cart down the same aisle and made a normal, non-violent contact with a lower portion of the shelving.

15. The contact with the shelving was of the type and degree reasonably foreseeable in a busy retail store open to the public.

16. As a result of the condition and arrangement of the boxes on the shelves, a large toaster-oven box fell from near the top of the stack, from a significant height, into the aisle where Plaintiff was standing.

17. The falling toaster-oven box struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of his head.

18. Immediately after being struck, Plaintiff experienced dizziness and a severe headache.

19. Store employees were notified that Plaintiff had been struck by falling merchandise. The store manager came to the scene, spoke with Plaintiff, and completed an incident report documenting the event.

20. The manager offered Plaintiff a store coupon in response to the incident but did not offer any meaningful medical assistance beyond noting the event.

21. Following the incident, Plaintiff’s symptoms—including dizziness and headache—continued and worsened over the course of the evening.

22. Later that night, due to increasing symptoms, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an emergency room.

23. At the emergency room, medical personnel evaluated Plaintiff and diagnosed him with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

24. Plaintiff was advised to rest, limit physical activity, and avoid strenuous work and sports, and he was given treatment and instructions consistent with concussion and shoulder strain management.

25. Prior to this incident, Plaintiff worked as a delivery driver and regularly engaged in recreational activities, including playing in a weekly soccer league.

26. As a direct result of his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for several days and missed approximately $800 in wages.

27. As a further direct result of his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to participate in his weekly soccer league and other normal physical and social activities for approximately one month, causing loss of enjoyment of life.

28. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses, including but not limited to emergency room treatment, diagnostic evaluation, and follow-up care.

29. Plaintiff continues to experience residual symptoms, discomfort, and limitations in his shoulder and intermittent headaches, and he has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.

30. Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Store, owed a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees, including Plaintiff, and to protect them against reasonably foreseeable risks of harm.  
    See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

31. Defendant also owed a duty to inspect, stock, and arrange merchandise in a manner that did not create an unreasonable risk of injury to customers lawfully on the premises.  
    See *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837 (1987); *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

32. Falling merchandise in a retail store is a well-known and foreseeable hazard, particularly where heavy items are stacked at height without adequate restraints or barriers and in areas where customers regularly pass and use carts.

33. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that stacking heavy appliance boxes five to six high on open shelving without restraints, in a high-traffic aisle, created an unreasonable risk that the boxes could fall and injure a customer.

34. Defendant knew or should have known that ordinary customer conduct—such as pushing a cart and having it occasionally bump a shelf—was foreseeable and should have been anticipated and guarded against.  
    See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (duty encompasses reasonably foreseeable acts of third persons); *Sharpe v. Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc.*, 401 Mass. 788 (1988).

35. Despite the foreseeable risk, Defendant failed to implement reasonable safety measures such as:  
    a. Installing rails, bars, or netting on shelves to prevent items from falling;  
    b. Limiting the height at which heavy boxes could be stacked;  
    c. Using straps or other restraints to secure stacked merchandise;  
    d. Posting warnings regarding the risk of falling merchandise; and  
    e. Properly training and supervising employees regarding safe stacking and merchandising practices.

36. Defendant’s failure to take such measures created a hazardous condition on the premises.

37. Defendant either created the hazardous condition by the manner in which it stacked and displayed its merchandise, or allowed the hazardous condition to exist for such a length of time that, in the exercise of reasonable care, it should have discovered and corrected it.  
    See *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560 (1955); *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263 (1961).

38. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the incident. Plaintiff was using the premises in an ordinary, foreseeable, and reasonable manner at the time he was injured.

39. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was acting with reasonable care for his own safety and did not voluntarily or knowingly assume the risk of being struck by falling merchandise.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, including a mild concussion and shoulder strain, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, suffered pain and suffering, and endured loss of enjoyment of life and other damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
#### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

41. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

42. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, maintenance, and control of the Store, including the duty to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect against foreseeable harms.  
    See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995); G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence framework, preserving liability where defendant’s negligence exceeds plaintiff’s).

43. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to inspect for and remedy unsafe conditions, and to avoid creating unreasonably dangerous conditions in the manner in which merchandise was stocked, stacked, and displayed.  
    See *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837 (1987); *Oliveri v. MBTA*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

**Breach**

44. Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:

   a. Stacking heavy boxes of appliances five to six boxes high on shelves in a manner that created an unreasonable risk of falling merchandise;

   b. Failing to use safety straps, barriers, rails, netting, or other devices to prevent boxes from falling into customer aisles;

   c. Failing to reasonably limit the height and placement of heavy items in areas where customers routinely pass and use shopping carts;

   d. Failing to adequately inspect and monitor merchandise displays to identify and correct hazardous stacking conditions;

   e. Failing to implement and enforce appropriate policies and training regarding safe merchandising practices to protect customers from falling objects;

   f. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the risk of falling merchandise in the aisle where heavy boxes were stacked at height; and

   g. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to ensure the safety of customers.

45. The risk that a customer or shopping cart might lightly bump a shelf in a busy retail store is foreseeable as a matter of law and common experience, and Defendant’s duty of reasonable care includes taking precautions against such foreseeable conduct.  
    See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995); *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196 (1994).

46. Defendant either created the dangerous condition through its own merchandising practices or allowed it to remain uncorrected despite having actual or constructive notice of the hazard.  
    See *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560 (1955); *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263 (1961); *Aylward v. McCloskey*, 412 Mass. 77 (1992).

47. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land is liable when its failure to exercise reasonable care to protect invitees from dangers on the land results in foreseeable harm.  
    See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).

**Causation**

48. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of the toaster-oven box falling from the shelf and striking Plaintiff.

49. But for Defendant’s negligence in stacking and securing the heavy merchandise, the box would not have fallen, and Plaintiff would not have been injured.

50. The harm suffered by Plaintiff was a natural and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligent creation and maintenance of a dangerous condition on the premises.  
    See *Sharpe v. Peter Pan Bus Lines, Inc.*, 401 Mass. 788 (1988).

**Damages**

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, including but not limited to a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

52. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,500 for evaluation and treatment of his injuries and reasonably anticipates future medical care and related expenses.

53. Plaintiff lost approximately $800 in wages due to his inability to work as a delivery driver for several days following the incident.

54. Plaintiff suffered pain and suffering, including headaches, dizziness, shoulder pain, and related physical discomfort.

55. Plaintiff experienced mental anguish, stress, and anxiety related to the incident and his recovery.

56. Plaintiff experienced a loss of enjoyment of life, including but not limited to being unable to participate in his weekly soccer league and other normal recreational activities for about one month.

57. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages are compensable under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence); G.L. c. 231, § 60F (prejudgment interest in tort actions); and the common law of negligence.  
    See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837 (1987).

58. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life.  
    See *Rodrigues v. Miriam Hosp.*, 160 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying Massachusetts negligence law); *Santos v. Chrysler Corp.*, 430 Mass. 198 (1999).
