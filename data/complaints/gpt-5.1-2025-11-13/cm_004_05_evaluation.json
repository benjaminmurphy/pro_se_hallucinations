      "support_reasoning": "The opinion is an adoption/termination-of-parental-rights case that focuses on parental unfitness, evidentiary issues, and procedural matters. It does not discuss parenting time, visitation, or modification standards based on changes in housing or physical circumstances. Nothing in the decision addresses overnight contact limitations or how later acquisition of suitable housing could constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances, so it cannot be authority for the proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We take this opportunity, however, to comment on an issue raised by the father regarding the right of a parent in a care and protection proceeding to take the deposition of a person likely to be called as a witness at trial.\n\n... A judge considering a petition brought by the department pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, to dispense with parental consent to adoption is required to evaluate whether the parent contesting the petition is fit to provide for the welfare and the best interests of the child whose adoption is being considered."

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion concerns notice requirements under a public construction payment bond statute (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29) and does not address parenting plans, custody, or modification of parenting schedules. Nothing in the holding or reasoning discusses parental cooperation, agreements about changing a parenting plan, or how such agreements factor into a court\u2019s best-interests analysis. The case is therefore inapposite to the claimed family-law proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "A person who has furnished labor or materials for public works and who has not been fully paid has a right under \u00a7 29 to seek recovery under the bond of the general contractor in satisfaction of amounts justly due. Section 29 attaches three conditions to this right. A claimant must be eligible to claim protection under \u00a7 29; give written notice to the general contractor of its claim; and commence an action in Superior Court within the time limitations established by the statute."
