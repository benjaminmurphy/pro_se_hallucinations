    Plaintiff,  

v.

------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee (“Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jennifer Lee (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) is an individual who, on information and belief, resides at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and is Plaintiff’s neighbor in a duplex residence sharing a common driveway.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of an incident that occurred on or about March 15, 2023, at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 and G.L. c. 214, § 1, because Plaintiff seeks legal and equitable relief for common-law negligence, and the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of the District Court and is appropriate for the Superior Court.

5. Venue is proper in Hampden County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and § 2, because the cause of action arose in Hampden County and both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Hampden County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Defendant were co-occupants of a duplex residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and shared the use of a common driveway appurtenant to the property.

7. Defendant routinely stored and maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder in the area immediately adjacent to the shared driveway, leaning the ladder unsecured against a wooden fence located beside the area where Plaintiff regularly parked her automobile.

8. The ladder was positioned in such a manner that, if it fell, it could reasonably be expected to strike vehicles parked in the driveway, including Plaintiff’s vehicle.

9. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed to Defendant her concern that the ladder was unstable, that it might fall, particularly on windy days, and that it posed a risk of damage to her vehicle.

10. In response to Plaintiff’s concerns, Defendant acknowledged the risk and stated that he would either tie down the ladder, secure it, or move it to a safer location.

11. Despite these assurances, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to secure, tie down, relocate, or otherwise make safe the ladder, and continued to leave it leaning unsecured against the wooden fence next to the shared driveway.

12. On or about March 15, 2023, a day with significant wind in Springfield, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was backing her automobile into the shared driveway at 123 Elm Street.

13. While Plaintiff was engaged in the careful and lawful operation of her vehicle, a gust of wind caused the unsecured aluminum ladder, which Defendant had left leaning against the wooden fence, to topple over into the driveway.

14. The falling ladder struck Plaintiff’s automobile with substantial force, crashing onto the hood and windshield.

15. As a direct and proximate result of the ladder’s impact, the hood of Plaintiff’s vehicle was dented and the windshield was cracked and rendered unsafe for continued use.

16. Although the automobile remained operable, the vehicle required professional bodywork repair to the hood and replacement of the damaged windshield.

17. Plaintiff was required to submit a claim to her automobile insurer and pay a deductible out of pocket in order to repair the damage caused by the ladder.

18. Plaintiff’s vehicle was in the repair shop for more than one week due to the damage caused by Defendant’s unsecured ladder.

19. During the time that her vehicle was being repaired, Plaintiff was required to rent a replacement vehicle at her own expense in order to conduct her daily activities and attend to personal responsibilities.

20. Plaintiff incurred expenses including, but not limited to:  
    a. Payment of her insurance deductible for the vehicle repairs;  
    b. Costs of a rental vehicle during the repair period; and  
    c. Other incidental out-of-pocket expenses reasonably related to the loss of use and repair of the vehicle.

21. Plaintiff did not sustain bodily injury or incur medical expenses as a result of the incident, and she did not lose wages from employment as a result of the incident, but she did sustain property damage, loss-of-use damages, and consequential out-of-pocket losses.

22. At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety and the safety of her property, including when parking and operating her vehicle in the shared driveway.

23. At all relevant times, Defendant had exclusive control over the placement, storage, and securing of his ladder, and Plaintiff neither exercised nor had a right to exercise control over the manner in which Defendant stored the ladder.

24. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder unsecured and leaning against a fence immediately adjacent to an area where vehicles are routinely parked and operated, and after specific warnings and complaints from Plaintiff, created an unreasonable risk that the ladder would fall and cause damage to Plaintiff’s property.

25. Despite this foreseeable risk, Defendant failed to take reasonable precautions to secure, tie, or relocate the ladder to prevent it from falling.

26. Defendant’s conduct, acts, and omissions, as described above, directly and proximately caused the damage to Plaintiff’s automobile and Plaintiff’s resulting financial losses.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(NEGLIGENCE)

27. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 26 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

28. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others and their property. See Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–697 (2000); Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006).

29. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care arising from, among other things:  
    a. Their relationship as neighboring occupants sharing a common driveway at 123 Elm Street;  
    b. Defendant’s ownership, possession, and control of the ladder; and  
    c. Defendant’s creation and maintenance of a condition (an unsecured, tall ladder leaning against a fence adjacent to the driveway) that posed an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff’s vehicle. See Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995) (duty arises when conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm); Luoni v. Berube, 431 Mass. 729, 731–733 (2000) (duty concerning dangerous conditions and foreseeable harms).

30. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder unsecured and leaning against a fence adjacent to the shared driveway was unreasonably dangerous and posed a substantial risk that the ladder could be blown over by wind and damage Plaintiff’s vehicle.

31. Defendant’s knowledge of the danger was heightened because Plaintiff expressly warned Defendant on multiple occasions that she was concerned the ladder might fall onto her car, especially on windy days, and Defendant acknowledged those concerns and promised to secure or move the ladder.

32. These repeated warnings placed Defendant on actual notice of the specific risk that ultimately materialized. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 61 (1983) (foreseeability supported by prior warnings and notice); Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–106 (1978) (duty informed by actual knowledge of potential hazard).

33. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:  
    a. Failing to secure the ladder with ties, fasteners, or other appropriate means;  
    b. Failing to relocate the ladder to a safer position away from the driveway;  
    c. Failing to lay the ladder flat on the ground or otherwise store it in a reasonably safe manner;  
    d. Continuing to store the ladder in an unstable condition despite specific written or oral warnings from Plaintiff regarding the risk; and  
    e. Failing to inspect, monitor, or correct a dangerous condition that Defendant himself created and controlled.

34. In Massachusetts, liability for negligence arises when a defendant fails to exercise the care of an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances, and such failure is the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 283; Mullins, 389 Mass. at 54–55; Glidden, 430 Mass. at 696.

35. A reasonable person in Defendant’s position, knowing that:  
    a. The ladder was tall and capable of causing substantial damage if it fell;  
    b. The ladder was leaning unsecured against a fence adjacent to a driveway;  
    c. Vehicles, including Plaintiff’s, regularly parked and maneuvered in that driveway; and  
    d. Plaintiff had specifically complained about the risk of the ladder falling in windy weather,  
    would have taken steps to secure or relocate the ladder to avoid the risk of it toppling over and damaging Plaintiff’s vehicle.

36. Defendant’s failure to take any such precautionary measures constitutes a breach of his duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts negligence law. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 147–149 (owner’s duty to secure dangerous instrumentalities when risk of harm to others is foreseeable); Yakubowicz v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 404 Mass. 624, 629–30 (1989) (duty extends to risks that are reasonably foreseeable).

37. The danger that in fact occurred—the ladder being blown over by wind and striking Plaintiff’s vehicle—was a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s negligent conduct and was precisely the type of harm that made Defendant’s conduct unreasonable. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 640–642 (1996) (foreseeability of general type of harm suffices); Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc., 355 Mass. 450, 454–455 (1969).

38. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. But for Defendant’s negligent storage and failure to secure the ladder, the ladder would not have fallen and Plaintiff’s vehicle would not have been damaged. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (proximate cause where negligent conduct is substantial contributing factor in bringing about harm).

39. Plaintiff herself did not act negligently and bears no comparative fault for the occurrence of the incident. Plaintiff parked and operated her vehicle in the normal and expected manner within the shared driveway, and she had previously taken reasonable steps to prevent the harm by warning Defendant about the dangerous condition and asking that he correct it.

40. Even if the Court were to find that Plaintiff bore some degree of comparative negligence, which Plaintiff expressly denies, Plaintiff would still be entitled to recover under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, so long as any negligence attributable to Plaintiff is not greater than the negligence attributable to Defendant, and any such recovery would be reduced in proportion to Plaintiff’s percentage of fault.

41. Under G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to interest on any damages awarded for property damage from the date this action is commenced.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following injuries and damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Physical damage to her automobile, including dents to the hood and a cracked and unsafe windshield;  
    b. Payment of an insurance deductible for repair and replacement of the hood and windshield;  
    c. Loss of use of her vehicle during the time it was being repaired;  
    d. Costs of renting a substitute vehicle for more than one week while her own vehicle was in the repair shop;  
    e. Incidental expenses reasonably related to the damage and loss of use of her vehicle; and  
    f. Inconvenience and disruption to her daily life associated with the loss of use and repair process.

43. Plaintiff did not incur medical bills or lose wages as a result of the incident; however, Massachusetts negligence law permits recovery for property damage, loss of use, and consequential economic losses proximately caused by a defendant’s breach of duty. See, e.g., G.L. c. 231, § 85; Hopkins v. Medeiros, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 602–604 (2000) (recognizing recovery for property damage and related consequential losses).

44. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages for property loss and consequential economic harm proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with statutory interest and costs.

---

### V. DAMAGES

45. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 44 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

46. The total amount of Plaintiff’s damages, including but not limited to her insurance deductible, rental vehicle costs, loss-of-use value, and other incidental expenses, exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of this Court.

47. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably believed to be in excess of $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, to fairly compensate her for all losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jennifer Lee respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;

B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages, including but not limited to:  
   1. The full cost of repair to Plaintiff’s vehicle reasonably attributable to the incident;

   3. Damages for loss of use of Plaintiff’s vehicle during repair;  
   4. Reimbursement for the cost of a rental vehicle and any other reasonable substitute transportation expenses incurred while Plaintiff’s vehicle was being repaired; and  
   5. Any other incidental and consequential damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence;

C. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

D. Award Plaintiff her taxable costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 261;

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
