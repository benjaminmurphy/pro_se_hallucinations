                       COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
                 (PROPERTY DAMAGE – PERSONAL INJURY ACTION)

Plaintiff Carlos Martinez (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Reed (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

                              I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Carlos Martinez is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Thomas Reed is an individual, upon information and belief residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and is the neighboring occupant of the same duplex property as Plaintiff.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, or controlled the aluminum extension ladder that is the subject of this action, and had control over where and how it was stored along the shared driveway and fence line.

                       II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy, including property damage and consequential damages, reasonably and in good faith exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

6. Venue is proper in Hampden County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the parties reside in Hampden County and the events and occurrences giving rise to this cause of action took place at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, within Hampden County.

7. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because he resides in Massachusetts and the tortious conduct and resulting harm occurred within the Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 223A, §§ 2–3.

                        III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a duplex located at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway used for parking and access to their respective units.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant owned and maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder.

10. For an extended period before March 15, 2023, Defendant stored and left the ladder upright and leaning against a wooden fence immediately adjacent to the shared driveway and directly next to the area where Plaintiff regularly parked his vehicle.

11. The ladder, when leaned unsecured against the fence, was tall, narrow, and relatively light, and was susceptible to being dislodged by wind or incidental contact, posing a foreseeable risk of falling onto vehicles or individuals in the shared driveway.

12. Plaintiff observed the precarious position of the ladder and was reasonably concerned that it might fall onto his car, especially during windy conditions common in Springfield in late winter and early spring.

13. On at least two occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressly informed Defendant of his concerns and specifically warned Defendant that the ladder might fall and damage Plaintiff’s car, particularly on windy days.

14. Plaintiff requested that Defendant either move the ladder to a safer location or properly secure it so that it could not be easily blown over or otherwise fall into the driveway.

15. On these occasions, Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would “tie it down” or “move it,” but failed to take effective or reasonable measures to secure or relocate the ladder.

16. Despite Plaintiff’s warnings and Defendant’s acknowledgement, Defendant continued to store the ladder leaning unsecured against the wooden fence next to Plaintiff’s parking area in the shared driveway.

17. On or about March 15, 2023, a windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was operating his vehicle and backing into the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street.

18. At that time, a gust of wind struck the unsecured ladder, causing it to dislodge from its resting position against the fence.

19. The ladder fell forcefully into the driveway and crashed onto the front portion of Plaintiff’s vehicle, striking the hood and windshield.

20. As a direct and immediate result of the ladder’s fall, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained physical damage, including but not limited to a dented hood and a cracked or broken windshield.

21. Although the vehicle remained operable, it required professional body repair and replacement of the windshield to restore it to its pre-incident condition.

22. Plaintiff promptly arranged for necessary repairs, including replacement of the windshield and bodywork on the hood, from an auto repair facility.

23. Plaintiff was required to pay his automobile insurance policy deductible out of pocket in order to have the needed repairs completed.

24. While his vehicle was being repaired over the course of more than one week, Plaintiff had to rent a substitute vehicle to meet his transportation needs.

25. Plaintiff incurred rental car charges and related expenses during the period his vehicle was unavailable due to the damage caused by the fallen ladder.

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct described herein, Plaintiff suffered economic losses, including but not limited to: (a) payment of his insurance deductible, (b) rental car expenses, and (c) other out-of-pocket costs and loss of use of his vehicle.

27. Plaintiff’s medical expenses are approximately $0, and Plaintiff lost approximately $0 in wages, but he sustained property damage and consequential economic harm directly caused by Defendant’s negligence.

28. At all material times, Plaintiff acted reasonably and exercised due care for his own property.

29. At all material times, Defendant had the ability and opportunity to secure or move the ladder to a safe location, to lay it flat, or to otherwise eliminate or substantially reduce the known risk that it would be blown over by wind.

30. Defendant failed to take such reasonable precautions, despite actual notice of the hazard and Plaintiff’s specific warnings, and despite the obvious and foreseeable risk of harm to vehicles parked in the shared driveway.

31. The risk that a tall, unsecured aluminum ladder leaning against a fence next to a parking area might fall in windy conditions and damage a vehicle is foreseeable to a reasonable person under the circumstances.

32. Defendant’s failure to secure or reposition the ladder constituted a failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to Plaintiff’s property.

33. Defendant’s negligent conduct created an unreasonable and avoidable risk of harm, which directly resulted in Plaintiff’s damages on March 15, 2023.

34. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer property damage, financial losses, inconvenience, and loss of use of his vehicle.

                     IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

35. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully set forth herein.

36. Under Massachusetts law, negligence consists of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, a breach of that duty, causation (both factual and proximate), and damages. See, e.g., Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

A. Duty

37. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage, placement, and securing of the ladder kept in the shared driveway area, so as to avoid creating an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff’s person or property. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 147–48 (duty arises where a person “creates a risk of harm to others” and where harm is “reasonably foreseeable”); Remy v. MacDonald, 440 Mass. 675, 677–78 (2004).

38. Defendant also owed a duty of reasonable care as a neighbor and co-occupant sharing a common area, including the duty not to maintain an unreasonably dangerous condition that foreseeably threatened Plaintiff’s vehicle. See Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995) (duty of reasonable care extends to foreseeable risks from conditions in areas under one’s control); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302A (cited with approval in Jupin, 447 Mass. at 148).

39. A person who stores or maintains potentially dangerous objects or equipment in proximity to others must use reasonable care to prevent those objects from causing foreseeable harm. See Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc., 355 Mass. 450, 452–53 (1969) (discussing duty where defendant’s conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm); Afarian v. Mass. Elec. Co., 449 Mass. 257, 263–64 (2007).

B. Breach

40. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Storing the tall aluminum extension ladder upright and unsecured, leaning against a wooden fence directly adjacent to the shared driveway and Plaintiff’s parking area;

   b. Failing to tie down, anchor, secure, or otherwise stabilize the ladder despite knowing that it was vulnerable to being displaced by wind;

   c. Failing to move the ladder to a safer location where it would not pose a danger to vehicles or persons using the shared driveway;

   d. Ignoring Plaintiff’s repeated warnings and expressed concerns that the ladder might fall and damage Plaintiff’s car, particularly on windy days;

   e. Failing to take any reasonable remedial actions within a reasonable period of time after receiving such warnings, despite having the opportunity and ability to do so.

41. The standard of care is that of an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances. Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the ladder—after specific warnings and in the face of an obvious and foreseeable risk—fell below that standard. See Foley v. Boston Hous. Auth., 407 Mass. 640, 646–47 (1990) (breach shown where defendant fails to take reasonable steps to guard against foreseeable risk); Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 54–57 (1983).

C. Causation

42. Defendant’s negligent conduct was the actual and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages.

43. But for Defendant’s failure to reasonably secure or relocate the ladder, the ladder would not have been in a position to be blown over by the wind into Plaintiff’s vehicle on March 15, 2023, and Plaintiff’s vehicle would not have been damaged. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 148–49 (discussing “but for” and proximate causation).

44. The type of accident that occurred—an unsecured tall ladder falling in the wind onto a vehicle parked next to it—is a natural and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s conduct. See Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (foreseeability governs scope of risk under proximate cause); Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996).

45. The occurrence of a strong gust of wind in March in Springfield, Massachusetts is not an extraordinary or superseding event; it is a foreseeable and ordinary condition that a reasonably prudent person would anticipate when deciding how to store and secure a tall ladder near vehicles. See Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc., 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902–03 (1987) (foreseeable natural conditions do not break chain of causation).

46. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to Plaintiff’s vehicle and the ensuing economic losses. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002).

D. Damages

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages, among others:

   a. Physical damage to his motor vehicle, including but not limited to a dented hood and cracked or broken windshield;

   b. Out-of-pocket expenses to repair said damage, including Plaintiff’s automobile insurance policy deductible;

   c. Rental vehicle charges and related expenses incurred while Plaintiff’s vehicle was in the repair shop and unavailable for use for more than one week;

   d. Loss of use of his vehicle during the period of repair;

   e. Incidental and consequential damages reasonably arising from the incident, including inconvenience and disruption of daily activities.

48. Massachusetts law recognizes recovery for property damage, economic loss, and loss of use proximately caused by another’s negligence. See Santos v. Chrysler Corp., 430 Mass. 198, 205–06 (1999) (economic damages recoverable in negligence where foreseeably caused); G.L. c. 231, § 85A (evidence of vehicle registration and ownership); G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence).

49. Plaintiff’s medical expenses from this incident are approximately $0, and Plaintiff lost approximately $0 in wages; however, Plaintiff has been financially harmed through the destruction and impairment of his property and via the consequential costs of repair and substitute transportation.

50. Plaintiff’s damages were reasonably foreseeable, and Plaintiff is entitled to be made whole by an award of compensatory damages under Massachusetts law. See Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 548 (1982); Daley v. Town of Watertown, 352 Mass. 523, 526–27 (1967).

51. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent, if any, to bringing this action, or such conditions have been waived or are inapplicable.

52. No comparative negligence or fault by Plaintiff caused or contributed to the incident. Plaintiff neither placed the ladder in its dangerous position nor had control over its storage or securing.

53. To the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff denies such allegation and asserts that any such fault is de minimis and, in any event, does not bar recovery but at most would proportionally reduce damages, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85.

                               V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Carlos Martinez respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Thomas Reed, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed in good faith to exceed $25,000, including:

   1. The cost to repair damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, including the dented hood and cracked or broken windshield;

   2. Reimbursement of Plaintiff’s automobile insurance deductible paid as a result of the incident;

   3. Reimbursement of rental car expenses and other transportation-related costs incurred while Plaintiff’s vehicle was being repaired;

   4. Damages for loss of use of Plaintiff’s vehicle for the period reasonably necessary to complete repairs;

   5. Any other consequential damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence;

B. Pre-judgment interest at the statutory rate from the date of the incident, March 15, 2023, or such other date as permitted by G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C. Post-judgment interest at the statutory rate from the date of judgment until paid;

D. Costs of this action as allowed by law, including filing fees and other recoverable costs pursuant to G.L. c. 261 and applicable rules;

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                           VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

Plaintiff,
