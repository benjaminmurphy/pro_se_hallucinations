LISA MONTGOMERY,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                   Docket No. __________  

MARK DAVIS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(PARENTING TIME / CUSTODY)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Lisa Montgomery (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows in support of her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting-time Judgment/Order entered by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2020:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Montgomery (“Mother”), is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Emma Davis and Noah Davis.

2. The Defendant, Mark Davis (“Father”), upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor children, Emma Davis and Noah Davis.

3. The parties are the parents of the following minor children:  
   a. Emma Davis, date of birth: __________ (age 8); and  
   b. Noah Davis, date of birth: __________ (age 6)  
   (collectively, the “minor children” or “children”).

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this Court previously issued the custody and parenting-time orders at issue, and the children reside in Massachusetts.

5. Venue in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and applicable Massachusetts domestic relations law, as the parties and the children reside in Bristol County and the original Judgment/Order was entered in this Court.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

6. On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2020 Order”) establishing legal and physical custody and a parenting schedule for the parties’ minor children.

7. Under the 2020 Order, Mother has primary physical custody of the minor children, and Father was awarded parenting time consisting, in substance, of:
   a. Every other weekend parenting time; and  
   b. One overnight per week during the school/work week, such that Father would care for the children overnight on a designated weekday.

8. At the time the 2020 Order was entered, both parties worked regular daytime hours, such that the parenting schedule, including Father’s weeknight overnight, was consistent with the parties’ work schedules and the best interests of the minor children.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2020 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances relating to Father’s work schedule, his ability to personally care for the children during his court‑ordered parenting time, and the children’s safety, stability, and best interests.

10. Specifically, upon information and belief, Father has recently obtained and/or begun working a new job in which his regular schedule includes overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. on multiple nights per week, including many of the nights on which he is scheduled to exercise overnight parenting time with the children pursuant to the 2020 Order.

11. As a result of this new work schedule, Father is often not personally available to provide direct care and supervision to the children during his court‑ordered overnight parenting time.

12. On numerous occasions, Father has either:
   a. Dropped the children off at Mother’s home with little or no advance notice, stating that he is too tired to care for them after finishing his overnight shift; and/or  
   b. Left the children in the care of his roommate, an individual whom Mother scarcely knows and whose background, parenting ability, and suitability to supervise the minor children are unknown to Mother.

13. Mother is informed by the children that, when in Father’s care surrounding his overnight work shifts, they frequently fall asleep on the couch or remain unsupervised while Father naps or attempts to catch up on sleep after returning home from his shift.

14. Father’s repeated inability to remain awake, alert, and available to supervise the children during his parenting time, coupled with his reliance on an essentially unknown third party to care for the children overnight, constitutes a substantial and material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the 2020 Order.

15. These changes directly affect the children’s safety, supervision, rest, and overall welfare, and were not anticipated or reasonably foreseeable when the 2020 Order was entered.

16. Under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child.

17. The Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have consistently held that a significant change in the work schedule or living circumstances of a custodial or non‑custodial parent can constitute the requisite material change of circumstances warranting modification. See, e.g.:  
   a. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   b. *Custody of a Minor (No. 1)*, 377 Mass. 876 (1979);  
   c. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   d. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   e. *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 208 (2016);  
   f. *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript);  
   g. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006);  
   h. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   i. *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012);  
   j. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

18. In addition, Massachusetts law requires that the “paramount concern” in any custody or parenting‑time determination be the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).

19. Father’s new overnight work schedule was not contemplated by the 2020 Order and fundamentally undermines the premise upon which that Order’s parenting schedule was based—namely, that Father would be physically present and available during his overnight parenting time to personally care for the children.

20. Under these changed circumstances, maintaining the current schedule results in the children:
   a. Lacking consistent adult supervision during late‑evening and overnight hours when they should be safely in bed and monitored;  
   b. Being placed in the care of an essentially unknown roommate in lieu of a parent;  
   c. Experiencing unpredictable and last‑minute changes in where they will sleep, causing stress and disruption to their routines; and  
   d. Facing avoidable risks associated with Father’s fatigue, sleep deprivation, and inability to remain fully attentive to their needs after a 12‑hour overnight shift.

21. These circumstances materially affect the children’s physical safety, emotional stability, sleep, and school readiness, and thus satisfy the legal standard for a material and substantial change sufficient to warrant modification of the parenting-time provisions of the 2020 Order.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

22. Mother acknowledges the importance of the children maintaining a loving and meaningful relationship with Father and does not seek to terminate his relationship with the children. Rather, she seeks to adjust the schedule so that Father’s parenting time occurs when he is actually available, rested, and able to safely care for the children.

23. The proposed modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific problem caused by Father’s overnight work schedule and does not otherwise disturb the existing allocation of primary physical custody to Mother as established in the 2020 Order.

24. It is in the children’s best interests, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the decisions of the appellate courts cited above, that overnights occur only when Father is not scheduled to work an overnight shift and is reasonably rested and able to supervise the children.

25. Arranging the parenting schedule so that Father has overnight parenting time only on nights when he is off‑duty and not working an overnight shift will:
   a. Provide the children with consistent and adequate supervision during nighttime hours;  
   b. Ensure that the children spend overnights with a parent who is awake, attentive, and responsible for them;  
   c. Reduce the need for last‑minute, disruptive changes in the children’s sleeping arrangements;  
   d. Avoid reliance on an unknown third‑party roommate as a primary overnight caregiver; and  
   e. Protect the children’s educational and emotional well‑being by promoting stable sleep routines, consistent school attendance, and reduced anxiety.

26. The requested modification is also consistent with the public policy of the Commonwealth to protect the welfare and best interests of minor children and to ensure that parenting plans are practical and capable of being implemented in light of the parents’ actual circumstances. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

27. Given Father’s changed schedule and intermittent inability to personally exercise overnight parenting time, the current 2020 Order no longer serves the children’s best interests and must be modified to reflect the reality of the parties’ present circumstances.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

28. Mother respectfully requests that this Court modify the 2020 Order’s parenting‑time provisions concerning Father’s overnight parenting time, while leaving the designation of Mother as primary physical custodian in place, and enter an order substantially as follows (subject to the Court’s judgment and any further refinements it deems appropriate):

   a. Mother shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor children, as provided in the 2020 Order.

   b. Father shall continue to have parenting time on an every‑other‑weekend basis, with specific start and end times to be set by the Court, except that any overnights during such weekends shall occur only when Father is not working an overnight shift from approximately 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. (or similar hours).

   c. Father’s mid‑week overnight parenting time shall be modified so that:
      i. Any scheduled overnight during the week shall take place only on a night when Father is not working an overnight shift; and  
      ii. If Father is scheduled to work an overnight shift on the day before or the day of the planned overnight, the overnight shall not occur, and the children shall remain overnight with Mother unless the parties agree in writing to a different arrangement that ensures appropriate parental supervision.

   d. Father shall not delegate his court‑ordered overnight parenting time to unrelated third parties or roommates as primary caregivers in lieu of his personal care, except as may be reasonably necessary for short periods (e.g., brief errands) and consistent with typical childcare practices, or unless otherwise agreed upon by Mother in writing.

   e. The parties shall exchange their work schedules, to the extent necessary, in advance (e.g., monthly or as schedules become available) so that they can plan overnight parenting time consistent with Father’s non‑working nights and the children’s needs.

   f. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to implement an adjusted schedule that preserves Father’s relationship with the children while ensuring that all overnight parenting time occurs when Father is reasonably rested and able to supervise the children.

29. Mother further requests that the Court enter any other orders, temporary or permanent, that it deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the children during the pendency of this Complaint for Modification, including but not limited to temporary modification orders under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 and the Court’s equitable powers pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6.

30. Mother’s requested relief is consistent with the applicable statutes and case law, including but not limited to:  
   - G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31 (modification of custody and best interests standard);  
   - G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (modification of custody orders regarding children born out of wedlock, if applicable);  
   - G.L. c. 215, § 6 (equity jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court);  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 208 (2016);  
   - *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006);  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); and  
   - *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012).

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa Montgomery, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2020 Order, specifically including Father’s new overnight work schedule, his inability to consistently exercise overnight parenting time as ordered, and the resulting impact on the minor children’s safety, stability, and welfare;

B. Find that modification of the existing parenting‑time provisions, particularly Father’s overnight parenting time, is necessary and in the best interests of the minor children, Emma and Noah;

C. Modify the existing Judgment/Order, dated May 15, 2020, to provide that Father’s overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when he is not scheduled to work an overnight shift and is reasonably able to supervise and care for the children, and to include such additional terms as the Court considers appropriate to protect the children’s best interests, generally consistent with the relief requested in Paragraph 28 above;

D. Issue any temporary orders, as may be necessary, adjusting overnight parenting time during the pendency of this action to ensure that the children are properly supervised and that overnights occur only on nights when Father is not working and is able to care for them;

E. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor children.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LISA MONTGOMERY,
