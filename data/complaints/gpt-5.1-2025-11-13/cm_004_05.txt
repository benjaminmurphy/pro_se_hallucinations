COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

1. This is a Complaint for Modification of a prior Judgment/Order concerning custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Court’s equitable powers, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order, and that modification is in the best interests of the minor child.

                                       PARTIES

2. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an adult individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

3. The Defendant, Michael Smith (“Father”), is an adult individual, believed to reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

4. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Lucas Smith, born __________, now eight (8) years old.

                                    JURISDICTION

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and related statutes governing custody and parenting time, including G.L. c. 209C, § 20, because the original custody and parenting time orders were issued by this Court on April 15, 2018, and the minor child resides within the Commonwealth.

6. To the extent the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), G.L. c. 209B, applies, this Court is the child’s “home state” court and retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time matters concerning the minor child.

                               PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

7. On or about April 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment or Order (the “2018 Order”) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time of the parties’ minor child, Lucas Smith, then three (3) years old.

8. Under the 2018 Order, Mother was granted primary physical custody of the minor child.

9. Under the 2018 Order, Father was granted limited parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week plus one Sunday afternoon visit each week, with no overnights.

10. The 2018 Order restricted Father’s parenting time to day-only visits, with no overnights, primarily because at that time Father resided only in a room in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have a separate, appropriate sleeping area or bedroom for the minor child.

11. The 2018 Order was based on the then-existing circumstances of a three‑year‑old child, not yet in school full time, and a non‑residential parent without independent, suitable housing for overnight care.

                           MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the 2018 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, such that the existing parenting time schedule is no longer in the child’s best interests and should be modified.

13. Lucas Smith is now eight (8) years old, school‑aged, and attends school full time. His developmental needs, routine, and schedule are markedly different than when he was three years old at the time of the 2018 Order.

14. Father now has his own apartment, separate from any roommates, which is stable, appropriate housing for a minor child.

15. In Father’s current residence, the minor child has his own bedroom, with appropriate furnishings and space suitable for overnight parenting time and extended stays.

16. The reasons that supported the restriction against overnight parenting time in 2018—namely, Father’s lack of independent space and a separate sleeping area for the child—no longer exist.

17. Under the current schedule, Father exercises three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights. These visits occur primarily on school nights.

18. The current, fragmented schedule causes the minor child to be shuttled frequently between households for short visits on school days, which is disruptive to the child’s school routine, homework, extracurricular activities, stability, and bedtime schedule.

19. The short, weekday‑heavy visits make it more difficult for the child to complete homework consistently, maintain a regular bedtime, and have calm, predictable evenings, thereby affecting his overall well‑being and school readiness.

20. As an eight‑year‑old school‑aged child, Lucas can developmentally benefit from longer, more consolidated blocks of time with each parent, rather than multiple short transitions each week.

21. The current schedule does not reflect the child’s increased maturity, school obligations, or evolving emotional needs, nor does it take full advantage of Father’s improved housing and ability to care for the child overnight.

22. Lucas has repeatedly expressed a clear, age‑appropriate desire to have sleepovers and overnight parenting time at Father’s home, where he has his own bedroom and feels comfortable. While the child’s wishes are not controlling, they are relevant to his best interests.

23. Both parents recognize that the existing schedule no longer serves the child’s best interests and agree in principle that it should be changed so that the child can have overnights with Father, particularly on weekends and/or in a manner that better fits his school schedule.

24. The fact that both parents concur that the schedule is outdated and should be updated is significant but not dispositive; the Court must still determine whether modification is in the child’s best interests. Nonetheless, this mutual recognition underscores that a material change has occurred.

25. The substantial changes in (a) the child’s age and developmental stage, (b) his full‑time school attendance, (c) Father’s acquisition of stable, appropriate housing with a dedicated bedroom for the child, and (d) the practical impact of the current schedule on the child’s daily life, collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of Massachusetts law.

                      APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL STANDARDS

26. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and analogous provisions such as G.L. c. 209C, § 20, the Probate and Family Court may modify a prior judgment concerning custody or parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child.

27. Massachusetts appellate courts have long held that to modify a custody or parenting‑time order, a party must show: (1) a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child since the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:

   a. Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (material change and best interests standard governs modification of parenting orders);

   b. Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (same; emphasizing child‑focused analysis);

   c. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (modification requires material and substantial change in circumstances);

   d. Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (court must assess best interests in light of changed circumstances);

   e. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests standard governs all custody determinations);

   f. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (custody and parenting orders must promote the child’s welfare and best interests);

   g. Kendall v. Kendall, 426 Mass. 238 (1997) (best interests standard, including emotional and developmental needs);

   h. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (modification appropriate where circumstances render original order inconsistent with child’s best interests);

   i. Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406 (1976) (emphasizing the centrality of the child’s welfare);

   j. Hersey v. Hersey, 271 Mass. 545 (1930) (foundational articulation of “best interests of the child” standard).

28. In determining best interests, the Court considers the totality of the circumstances, including the child’s age, developmental needs, relationship with each parent, the stability of each home, and the practical effects of any schedule on the child’s routine, schooling, and emotional well‑being. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–842; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596.

29. The Court also gives appropriate weight to the child’s reasonable preferences, particularly when the child is of sufficient age and maturity to express meaningful views about parenting time, though such preferences are not controlling. See, e.g., Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 226–227 (1998); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 766 (1983).

30. Massachusetts law recognizes that as a child matures and circumstances evolve, parenting plans that were formerly appropriate may become outdated or inconsistent with the child’s needs, warranting modification. See Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 149–151 (school‑age child’s needs and circumstances justified modification); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–740.

31. Where, as here, a prior limitation on overnight contact was based in significant part on a parent’s then‑inadequate housing or physical circumstances, the later acquisition of appropriate, stable housing suitable for overnights may constitute a material and substantial change, permitting expansion of parenting time. See, e.g., Adoption of Paula, 420 Mass. 716, 731–732 (1995) (changes in parental circumstances, including housing stability, are relevant to parenting determinations); Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 900.

32. Even where parents generally cooperate or agree that a change is needed, the Court must still determine the specific schedule that best serves the child’s interests, but their agreement is highly relevant to the feasibility and likely success of a modified parenting plan. See, e.g., Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 186, 193–194 (2016).

                    APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS / BEST INTERESTS

33. The changes since the 2018 Order are both material and substantial: the minor child has advanced from a preschool‑aged toddler to a full‑time elementary school student, Father has obtained stable, appropriate housing with a private bedroom for the child, and the child’s own expressed desires and developmental needs have significantly evolved.

34. The 2018 Order’s prohibition on overnight visits was directly tied to Father’s prior living situation (a single room in a shared apartment, without a separate sleeping space for the child). This justification has completely changed, as Father now maintains an independent apartment with a private bedroom for Lucas.

35. The child’s current school‑age status and full‑time attendance mean that frequent, short visits on school nights are no longer developmentally appropriate and, in practice, are burdensome for the child and both parents.

36. The existing schedule fragments the child’s time, causing numerous transitions between homes each week, which interferes with homework, consistent bedtimes, and overall evening stability.

37. A revised schedule that includes overnights with Father—particularly in a way that consolidates time (for example, weekends or extended blocks) and reduces mid‑week disruptions—would better support the child’s educational, emotional, and social needs.

38. Allowing overnight parenting time with Father in a stable, safe residence with a dedicated bedroom will promote the child’s relationship with Father and provide the child with a fuller, more natural parent‑child experience, rather than limiting the relationship to brief daytime contact.

39. Lucas’s expressed desire to have sleepovers and overnight visits at Father’s home is consistent with the developmental expectation that a secure, school‑aged child will want deeper, more consistent time with both parents; honoring this desire, in a safe and appropriate environment, supports his emotional well‑being.

40. The fact that both Mother and Father agree that the current schedule is no longer appropriate and should be modified indicates that modification is likely to be implemented cooperatively, which benefits the child and promotes stability.

41. In light of the child’s age, school schedule, Father’s significantly improved living conditions, the impracticality of the current schedule, and the child’s wishes, maintaining a no‑overnight restriction is no longer aligned with Lucas’s best interests.

42. The requested modification will not deprive either parent of a relationship with the child; instead, it will realign parenting time so that (a) transitions are fewer and less disruptive, (b) both parents can enjoy meaningful, quality time, and (c) the child’s school routine and developmental needs are better supported.

43. Under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the controlling case law cited above, these changes warrant modification of the 2018 Order to provide for overnight parenting time with Father and a schedule that is suitable for an eight‑year‑old school‑aged child.

                           REQUESTED MODIFICATION / RELIEF

44. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Order to:

   a. Recognize that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since April 15, 2018; and  

   b. Implement a revised parenting‑time schedule that includes regular overnight parenting time with Father in accordance with Lucas’s current developmental stage and school schedule; and  

   c. Reduce the number of short, mid‑week transitions that interfere with school, homework, and bedtime routines, in favor of longer, more predictable blocks of parenting time with each parent.

45. Without limiting the foregoing general request that the Court enter such orders as it deems appropriate and in the child’s best interests, Mother specifically requests that the Court:

   a. Remove the prohibition against overnight parenting time by Father contained in the 2018 Order;  

   b. Establish a parenting‑time schedule granting Father reasonable and liberal parenting time that includes overnight visits, particularly on weekends and/or at such other times as the Court deems appropriate for a school‑aged child;  

   c. Tailor the schedule to minimize mid‑week disruptions to Lucas’s school attendance, homework, and bedtime; and  

   d. Enter any other and further orders regarding custody and parenting time that the Court finds are in Lucas’s best interests.

46. Mother does not seek to diminish Father’s role in Lucas’s life; rather, this Complaint is brought for the purpose of aligning the parenting plan with the child’s current needs and circumstances and to allow their son to have overnights with Father in a safe, appropriate, and developmentally supportive manner.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and declare that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2018 custody and parenting‑time Order;

2. Modify the 2018 Order to remove the restriction prohibiting overnight parenting time with Father;

3. Establish a revised parenting‑time schedule granting Father overnight parenting time, in such pattern and frequency as the Court deems in the best interests of Lucas Smith, taking into account his age, school schedule, and expressed wishes;

4. Adjust the parenting schedule so as to reduce frequent short mid‑week visits in favor of longer, more stable periods of parenting time that support the child’s homework, bedtime, and school routine;

5. Confirm that Mother continues as the primary physical custodian, unless the Court determines otherwise in Lucas’s best interests;

6. Enter such further orders as justice and the best interests of the minor child may require.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
EMILY JOHNSON
