COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)


Plaintiff Jessica Hartley (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Robert Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartley is an individual residing at 27 Wilcock Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02124.

2. Defendant Robert Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and landlord of the residential premises located at 27 Wilcock Street, Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, in that this is a civil action arising out of and relating to a residential rental premises located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the Premises are located in Dorchester, within Suffolk County, and the claims arise from Defendant’s conduct as landlord of that property.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a two-bedroom apartment located at 27 Wilcock Street, Dorchester, MA 02124 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”), under a rental agreement with Defendant.

6. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid monthly rent of $1,800.00 to Defendant for the Apartment.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, exercising ownership, control, and management of the Premises.

8. Plaintiff’s tenancy is a residential tenancy for use as Plaintiff’s home and dwelling.

9. From in or about the winter heating season of 2024–2025 and continuing thereafter, the heating system serving Plaintiff’s Apartment has been defective and inadequate.

10. Specifically, during the winter months, including but not limited to December 2024 through March 2025, the heat in Plaintiff’s Apartment repeatedly dropped to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, usually in the evenings and night hours when heat was most needed.

11. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., requires that during the heating season (September 15 through June 15), the owner must provide and maintain a heating system in good working order and capable of maintaining every habitable room at a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64°F at all other hours. See 105 CMR 410.200 (previously 105 CMR 410.201).

12. Plaintiff’s Apartment was routinely and repeatedly below the temperatures required by the State Sanitary Code for multiple hours at a time, particularly in the evenings, rendering the Apartment unreasonably cold and uncomfortable and impairing its use and enjoyment as a residence.

13. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating problems on multiple occasions during the winter, including but not limited to telephone communications and/or text or email messages in or about December 2024 and January 2025, describing that the heat was dropping and the Apartment was becoming too cold.

14. After Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant sent repair personnel to the building on two occasions.

15. On the first visit, the repair person stated that the problem had been fixed, and the heat appeared to operate more normally for approximately one week.

16. Thereafter, the heating problem recurred, and the Apartment again became unreasonably cold at various times, with temperatures dropping to about 60°F.

17. Plaintiff again complained to Defendant about the recurring heating issues.

18. On the second visit, the repair person informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and indicated that there was not much more to be done.

19. Despite these visits, the heating problems were never fully remedied; the condition persisted intermittently throughout the winter heating season.

20. Defendant refused and/or failed to take reasonable and effective steps to ensure that the heating system complied with the minimum standards required by the State Sanitary Code and Massachusetts law.

21. Defendant at various times asserted to Plaintiff that the heat was “working” because it never went completely out and the building was not “freezing,” minimizing or dismissing Plaintiff’s complaints even though the temperatures in the Apartment were below the Code-required levels.

22. Because the Apartment was too cold, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two electric space heaters in order to keep the Apartment habitable.

23. As a result of operating the space heaters, Plaintiff’s electric bill increased by approximately $150.00 per month during the affected winter period.

24. As a further consequence of the substandard temperatures and cold indoor conditions, Plaintiff developed bronchitis in or about January 2025.

25. Plaintiff’s treating physician informed Plaintiff that the cold indoor air was likely a contributing factor or aggravating influence to her respiratory illness.

26. Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work due to bronchitis, causing loss of income, and incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses for doctor visits and antibiotics.

27. The persistent and recurring failure of Defendant to maintain adequate heat as required by the State Sanitary Code and by the implied warranty of habitability rendered the Apartment substantially less fit for human habitation and caused Plaintiff substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of her home.

28. Plaintiff experienced discomfort, stress, loss of sleep, and disruption to daily life as she attempted to keep herself warm, monitor the heat, and manage her illness in a cold Apartment.

29. Plaintiff has at all times acted reasonably under the circumstances, attempted to work with Defendant, and taken steps to mitigate her damages, including by purchasing and using space heaters to protect her health and safety.

30. Despite notice and an opportunity to cure, Defendant failed to correct the defective heating condition in a timely and effective manner.

31. Defendant’s acts and omissions caused an interference with Plaintiff’s right to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, and relevant case law.

32. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: (a) increased utility expenses for supplemental electric heat; (b) medical expenses; (c) lost wages from missed work; and (d) loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment due to inadequate heat and resulting discomfort and illness.

33. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her total damages to be approximately $650.00, not including the potential treble damages and attorney’s fees provided by statute.

### IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

34. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–33 above as if fully restated herein.

35. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, protecting tenants from serious interference by the landlord (or those acting under the landlord’s control) with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See, e.g., G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982).

36. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in substance, that a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of a residential tenant, and that the landlord shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, for any such violation.

37. To establish breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a tenant must show that the landlord committed an act or omission that had the natural and probable effect of substantially interfering with the tenancy or rendering the premises unfit for the purposes of the lease. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–03.

38. A landlord’s failure to maintain a dwelling unit in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and to repair defective conditions within the landlord’s control, after notice, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–77 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

39. The obligation to provide adequate heat is a fundamental component of a habitable residence in Massachusetts, and the failure to maintain heat in accordance with the State Sanitary Code is a serious defect that can support a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment. See 105 CMR 410.200; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–03 (1979); see also McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977).

40. Massachusetts courts hold that a landlord’s repeated failure to correct building conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code, even after some repair efforts, may amount to an unreasonable and substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 775–77 (repeated failure to address conditions); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (Code violations and inaction by landlord support quiet enjoyment claim).

41. At all relevant times, Defendant was obligated under G.L. c. 186, § 14, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., to maintain the heating system serving Plaintiff’s Apartment in good working order and capable of providing the minimum temperatures required by law.

42. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the repeated heating failures, as Plaintiff directly notified Defendant and Defendant sent repair personnel to the building on two occasions.

43. Despite this knowledge, Defendant failed to correct the heating problem so that it would not recur and failed to ensure that the Apartment consistently met the minimum temperature requirements of the State Sanitary Code.

44. Defendant’s conduct—consisting of failure to perform adequate repairs, failure to replace or properly service an “old but functional” boiler, and minimizing Plaintiff’s complaints by insisting that the heat was “working” because it never fully shut off—constitutes an unreasonable refusal or neglect to remedy defective conditions the landlord had a duty to repair.

45. The inadequate heat and repeated temperature drops to around 60°F, especially during the winter evenings, had the natural and probable effect of substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment as a warm, safe, and habitable dwelling.

46. The conditions in Plaintiff’s Apartment violated the State Sanitary Code requirements regarding heat, constituting a material deprivation of services and facilities which the landlord is required to furnish. See 105 CMR 410.200; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 200–03; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973).

47. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s persistent failure to correct material Code violations can constitute a breach of both the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–201; Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 774–77; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

48. Although Defendant made two repair attempts, the repairs were ineffective in preventing recurrence of the problem. Partial or temporary efforts do not excuse a landlord’s ultimate failure to cure conditions that materially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 775–77; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 200–03.

49. Defendant’s acts and omissions, and the resulting conditions, directly caused Plaintiff to incur increased utility costs for space heaters, medical expenses for treatment of bronchitis, lost wages, discomfort, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

50. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were the direct and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat and comply with Massachusetts law.

51. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for actual and consequential damages or three (3) months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 774–77.

52. Plaintiff’s actual damages, including but not limited to additional electric costs, medical costs, and lost wages, are reasonably estimated at approximately $650.00.

53. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,800.00. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, the statutory minimum damages for a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment are three months’ rent, which in this case is $5,400.00, if that amount is greater than Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages.

54. Plaintiff therefore seeks an award of at least $5,400.00 in statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, plus costs, and, should Plaintiff later be represented by counsel, reasonable attorney’s fees, along with such other relief as is just.

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITIES (STATUTES AND CASES RELIED UPON)

55. In support of this Complaint and claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff relies, inter alia, upon the following Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and cases:

   f. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (standard for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; damages);  
   g. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liability for substantial interference with tenancy; quiet enjoyment);  
   h. Cruz Management Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994) (Code violations and landlord inaction as breach of quiet enjoyment);  
   i. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (elements and standard for quiet enjoyment claims);  
   j. Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (landlord responsibility for conditions interfering with tenants’ enjoyment);  
   k. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (quiet enjoyment and Code violations);  
   l. McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977) (Code violations, repair obligations, and landlord liability).

These authorities are cited as persuasive and controlling precedent regarding the scope of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the landlord’s duty to maintain habitable conditions, including adequate heat.
