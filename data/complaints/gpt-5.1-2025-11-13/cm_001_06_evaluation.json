It does not articulate or endorse a distinct principle that the court \u2018may, and should\u2019 weigh each parent\u2019s ability to personally care for the child during parenting time versus reliance on third parties; rather, it treats the mother\u2019s work and childcare arrangements as non-dispositive and not a valid basis for modification.",
