EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.

MICHAEL RICHARDS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Richards (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is a tenant of the residential premises located at 45 River Street, Unit ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Michael Richards is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the Premises located at 45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord of the Premises and responsible for the operation, maintenance, and management of the building in which the Premises are located.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is approximately Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), exclusive of statutory enhancements, costs, and attorney’s fees, and therefore is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, and the Massachusetts Trial Court rules, venue is proper in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this division.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 15, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises located at 45 River Street, Cambridge, MA (the “Tenancy”).

8. Plaintiff currently pays monthly rent of One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800.00) to Defendant for the Premises.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been a lawful tenant in good standing, has tendered rent as required, and has complied with her material obligations as a tenant.

10. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease or tenancy at will includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law. See, e.g., Johnson v. Keith, 368 Mass. 316, 318–19 (1975).

11. In or about early October 2025, Defendant commenced extensive renovation and construction work to the apartment unit immediately adjacent to the Premises (the “Renovation Project”).

12. Defendant informed Plaintiff shortly before the Renovation Project commenced that construction would take place in the neighboring unit, and that the work would be performed during daytime hours.

13. Since approximately early October 2025 and continuing through at least the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), Plaintiff has been subjected to persistent, disruptive construction noise, including but not limited to:

    a. constant or near-constant hammering;  
    b. loud drilling and power-tool operation; and  
    c. loud conversations and other noise from workers in the adjacent unit and common areas.

14. The construction noise generally begins at or about 8:00 a.m. and often continues until approximately 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, effectively occupying the entire normal workday.

15. Plaintiff works from home and is required to participate in frequent phone and video conferences as part of her employment.

16. The level and duration of the construction noise have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to perform her job duties, concentrate on work, and conduct professional calls from the Premises.

17. In addition to the noise, dust and construction debris have periodically infiltrated Plaintiff’s unit through vents and air pathways connected to the adjacent unit where the Renovation Project is taking place.

18. The dust and debris have affected Plaintiff’s living conditions, including air quality, cleanliness, and comfort in the Premises.

19. Upon information and belief, Defendant has planned and continues to carry out the Renovation Project as a voluntary, business-motivated improvement to the adjacent unit, and not as an emergency repair necessary for habitability or safety.

20. The Renovation Project has already persisted for approximately two months as of the date of this Complaint, and Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the work may continue for an additional one to two months, or longer.

21. The cumulative effect of the persistent daily noise, dust intrusion, and resulting disruption over this extended period has substantially deprived Plaintiff of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the Premises as her home and place of work.

22. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant about the disruptive conditions and their impact on her ability to work and enjoy the Premises.

23. In response, Defendant offered Plaintiff a nominal concession of approximately One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) off one month’s rent.

24. The limited rent reduction offered by Defendant does not reasonably compensate for the magnitude and duration of the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

25. Defendant has continued the Renovation Project with knowledge that the work is causing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

26. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant has not taken adequate steps to minimize or mitigate the disruption (such as altering the schedule, installing effective sound or dust barriers, temporarily relocating Plaintiff, or providing a meaningful rent abatement).

27. The persistent construction noise, dust, and disruption are directly attributable to Defendant’s actions and decisions in causing, directing, and allowing the Renovation Project to proceed in the manner and schedule chosen by Defendant.

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and the ongoing Renovation Project, Plaintiff has suffered:

    a. loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;  
    b. substantial interference with her ability to conduct her employment from home;  
    c. stress, frustration, and inconvenience; and  
    d. economic loss and diminished rental value of the Premises during the period of interference.

29. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) in actual damages for the period to date, including loss of rental value and consequential damages relating to her inability to fully and comfortably use the Premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

30. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and a landlord who does so is liable for either actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. G.L. c. 186, § 14.

32. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied into every residential tenancy and protects the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s authority. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977); Johnson v. Keith, 368 Mass. 316, 318–19 (1975).

33. A landlord may be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s actions, or those set in motion by the landlord, substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, even if the landlord does not specifically intend the harmful result. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

34. The covenant protects against substantial interference, including recurrent or continuous noise, dust, and other disturbances that render the premises significantly less fit for ordinary residential use. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 715–19; Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (construing G.L. c. 186, § 14 broadly in favor of tenants).

35. By planning, authorizing, and carrying out the Renovation Project in the adjacent unit in a manner that has caused recurring and extended periods of loud noise and dust intrusion, Defendant has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

36. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an “act” and “omission” under G.L. c. 186, § 14, because Defendant has (a) affirmatively caused the Renovation Project to occur and (b) failed to take reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 282–83 (1994) (landlord liability for failure to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable interference).

37. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been substantial and not merely trifling or de minimis, given:

    a. the duration of the Renovation Project already spanning approximately two months and ongoing;  
    b. the daily schedule intruding into normal working hours (approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., five days per week);  
    c. the intensity of the noise and dust; and  
    d. Plaintiff’s particular and known need to use the Premises as her primary workplace.

38. Defendant’s interference was and is foreseeable and within Defendant’s control, as Defendant has the authority to determine the timing, intensity, and scope of the Renovation Project, and to implement reasonable noise and dust mitigation measures, scheduling changes, or accommodations for Plaintiff.

39. Landlords are responsible under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for the acts of those they introduce onto the premises, such as contractors, where those acts interfere with tenants’ quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

40. The fact that the construction occurs during daytime hours and that some notice was provided does not immunize Defendant from liability, where the resulting interference is substantial and prolonged. The statute does not require malice or bad faith, only that the landlord’s acts or omissions cause an interference with quiet enjoyment. See Al‑Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–52; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

41. Defendant has not provided a meaningful rent abatement or comparable accommodation for the loss of use and enjoyment suffered by Plaintiff. A nominal, one-time discount of approximately $100 does not cure or waive Defendant’s liability for ongoing and substantial interference. See generally Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 400–01 (1982) (discussing damages and abatement concepts in landlord–tenant disputes).

42. The conditions created and allowed to persist by Defendant—constant construction noise, dust infiltration, and extended disruption—substantially deprive Plaintiff of the full benefit of her bargain and materially impair the value of the Premises as a quiet and habitable residence and place of work. See Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–49 (2005) (recognizing recovery where conditions substantially interfere with tenancy).

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress in the form of stress and frustration due to the ongoing disruption, and economic losses associated with the diminished value of the Premises during the period of interference. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (allowing emotional distress damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

44. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either (a) her actual and consequential damages, or (b) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Three months’ rent at $1,800 per month equals $5,400.

45. Plaintiff presently estimates her actual damages at not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), but under G.L. c. 186, § 14 she is entitled to recover the statutory minimum of three months’ rent if that amount exceeds her proven actual damages.

46. To the extent any provision of the Tenancy agreement is construed as limiting or waiving Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14, such provision would be void and unenforceable as against public policy. See G.L. c. 186, § 15F; Al‑Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

47. To the extent necessary, Plaintiff also relies on G.L. c. 93A, § 9 standards and analogous case law as persuasive authority regarding the reasonableness of landlord conduct, although Plaintiff does not assert a separate claim under G.L. c. 93A in this Complaint.

C. An order awarding Plaintiff her costs of this action as permitted by law;
