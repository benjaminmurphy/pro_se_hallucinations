BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER,  
        Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff James Thompson (“Plaintiff”), individually and as parent and next friend of his minor son, J.T., for his Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”), alleges as follows:

                               I.   PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff James Thompson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father and legal guardian of his minor son, J.T. (“J.T.”), who was eight (8) years old on the date of the incident described herein.

2. Defendant Brockton Community Center is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts nonprofit or other organized entity that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls a community center and after‑school program located at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant, through its employees, agents, and staff members, operated an after‑school program at its premises at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, including a gymnasium where children in its care were permitted and encouraged to play.

                        II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

4. This is a civil action sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount of damages claimed, exclusive of interest and costs, does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court Department of the Trial Court, and is within the jurisdiction of the Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A and applicable rules.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the cause of action arose in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and Defendant’s facility where the incident occurred is located in Brockton. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 3; G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

7. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because Defendant owns, operates, and conducts business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

               III.   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS – GENERAL  

8. At all times relevant, Defendant held itself out to the public, including Plaintiff, as operating a safe and supervised after‑school program for children.

9. Defendant advertised and represented that children enrolled in its after‑school program would be supervised at all times while in the gym and other program areas.

10. Plaintiff reasonably relied upon Defendant’s representations regarding supervision and safety in deciding to enroll J.T. in Defendant’s after‑school program.

11. On or about September 15, 2023, J.T. was enrolled in and attending Defendant’s after‑school program at the Brockton Community Center located at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302 (the “Premises”).

12. On that date, J.T. was present and participating in activities in Defendant’s gymnasium, under the purported supervision and control of Defendant’s staff members.

13. Approximately twenty (20) children were present in the gym at the time of the incident, ranging from younger elementary‑school‑age children, including J.T., to older children of approximately twelve (12) years of age.

14. Defendant’s policies and/or customary practice provided that at least two staff members were to be present in the gym supervising a group of approximately twenty children.

15. Despite this policy and the reasonably foreseeable need for active supervision, one of the two assigned staff members left the gym to attend to paperwork in an office, leaving only a single staff member in the gym with the children.

16. The remaining staff member, an employee or agent of Defendant acting within the scope of her employment, positioned herself near the bleachers and spent significant time looking at and using her phone.

17. The staff member failed to maintain active, reasonable, and proper supervision over the children in the gym, and failed to monitor their activities adequately.

18. While the staff member was inattentive and distracted by her phone, two older boys, each approximately twelve (12) years old, began engaging in rough, unsafe, and unsupervised physical play, including tackling each other on the hard gym floor.

19. The physical play engaged in by the older boys was rough, dangerous, and inappropriate for an indoor gym environment with a hard surface, particularly in the presence of younger and smaller children such as eight‑year‑old J.T.

20. The rough tackling and horseplay by the older boys created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to other children in the vicinity, including J.T.

21. Several children in the gym observed the rough tackling behavior by the older boys and, recognizing the danger, reported it to the supervising staff member.

22. Upon being informed by the children that the older boys were playing too rough and tackling each other on the gym floor, the staff member negligently responded, “boys will be boys,” or words to that effect.

23. The staff member failed to intervene, failed to stop the rough physical play, failed to separate the older boys, and failed to implement basic, reasonable steps to protect the younger children, including J.T., from foreseeable harm.

24. The staff member’s dismissive response and inaction signaled to the older boys that their dangerous tackling game was tolerated, and further increased the risk to other children.

25. Defendant, through its staff, allowed the rough tackling game to continue in the gym, in close proximity to younger and smaller children.

26. J.T., who is small for his age, was near the older boys while they continued their rough tackling game.

27. As a direct and foreseeable result of the continued rough tackling and Defendant’s failure to supervise and intervene, one of the larger twelve‑year‑old boys tackled J.T. hard, knocking him forcefully to the gym floor.

28. J.T. struck his head on the hard gym floor with significant force and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

29. J.T.’s loss of consciousness and head impact constituted a medical emergency, particularly for a minor child.

30. Defendant’s staff failed to prevent the incident by exercising reasonable care in supervising the children, despite having actual notice of the dangerous behavior and the opportunity and duty to intervene.

31. After the incident, J.T. required emergency medical attention and was transported to or presented at a hospital emergency room, where he was evaluated and diagnosed with a concussion.

32. As a result of the concussion and associated symptoms, J.T. missed several days of school and required ongoing monitoring and care.

33. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses on behalf of J.T. in an amount presently estimated to be approximately Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), and continues to face and/or reasonably anticipates additional medical and related expenses for follow‑up care, monitoring, and possible future treatment.

34. Plaintiff also lost approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) in wages due to time taken off from work to care for J.T., attend medical appointments, and address issues resulting from J.T.’s injury.

35. J.T. has suffered and continues to suffer pain, headaches, emotional distress, anxiety, discomfort, and other symptoms related to the concussion and the traumatic nature of the incident.

36. As a minor child, J.T. is particularly vulnerable to the effects of head injuries, and the long‑term consequences of concussive injuries, including cognitive, emotional, and behavioral impacts, are recognized risks associated with such trauma.

37. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate supervision in its gym, its failure to enforce reasonable safety rules, its failure to intervene to stop dangerous horseplay, and its failure to implement reasonable policies and training regarding supervision of children in after‑school programs constituted negligence under Massachusetts law.

38. Defendant’s conduct, as alleged herein, was a proximate and direct cause of J.T.’s injuries and of Plaintiff’s economic damages.

39. All conditions precedent to the bringing of this action, if any, have been satisfied, waived, or otherwise fulfilled.

40. Plaintiff brings this action individually and on behalf of his minor son J.T. for all damages recoverable under Massachusetts law.

                           IV.   CAUSE OF ACTION  
                               NEGLIGENCE  

(Against Defendant Brockton Community Center)  

41. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 40 above as if fully set forth herein.

42. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff’s minor son, J.T., as a child lawfully on the Premises and enrolled in Defendant’s after‑school program, to protect him from foreseeable harm and to exercise reasonable care in supervising his activities.

43. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor or operator of land open to the public for a fee, or otherwise inviting children onto its premises, owes a duty of reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition and to protect lawful visitors, including children, from foreseeable harm. See, e.g.:  
    a. G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute, providing that negligence actions shall be determined by comparative fault principles);  
    b. Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing the common‑law distinction between invitees and licensees and holding that landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors);  
    c. Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (duty to maintain premises in reasonably safe condition and to protect against foreseeable risks of harm);  
    d. Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors on premises).

44. Defendant, as the operator of an after‑school program for children, also owed a heightened and special duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising the children in its custody and control, particularly where Defendant undertook, by express representation and implication, to supervise the children “at all times” in the gym.

45. Massachusetts courts recognize that schools, youth organizations, and similar entities that assume responsibility for supervising children owe a duty to use reasonable care to protect those children from reasonably foreseeable harm arising from the conduct of other children. See, e.g.:  
    a. Irwin v. Ware, 392 Mass. 745 (1984) (duty arises where a special relationship exists and harm is reasonably foreseeable);  
    b. Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (college owed duty to protect resident student from foreseeable criminal acts due to special relationship);  
    c. Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244 (1982) (duty of reasonable care where harm is reasonably foreseeable);  
    d. Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty arises when actor’s conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm to another);  
    e. Luoni v. Berube, 431 Mass. 729 (2000) (foreseeability and reasonableness of precautions are jury questions in negligence actions).

46. Defendant’s relationship to J.T., as a child entrusted to Defendant’s after‑school program, was a “special relationship” under Massachusetts law, imposing on Defendant a duty to protect J.T. from reasonably foreseeable harms, including injury from dangerous horseplay and physical aggression by older children. See Irwin v. Ware, 392 Mass. at 756–57; Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. at 50–54.

47. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care to J.T., including but not limited to the following acts and omissions, each of which independently and collectively constituted negligence under Massachusetts law:

    a. Failing to provide a sufficient number of trained staff members to supervise approximately twenty children in the gym, despite Defendant’s policy requiring two staff members to be present;

    b. Permitting one of the two assigned staff members to leave the gym to perform paperwork in an office, leaving a single staff member to supervise the children;

    c. Failing to ensure that the remaining staff member provided active and attentive supervision, including monitoring the children’s activities rather than focusing on her phone;

    d. Allowing older, larger boys to engage in rough tackling and dangerous physical horseplay on the hard gym floor, in close proximity to younger and smaller children;

    e. Failing to respond appropriately and reasonably when other children reported the dangerous roughhousing to the supervising staff member;

    f. Responding to reports of dangerous conduct with the dismissive remark “boys will be boys” (or words to that effect), and thereby condoning or encouraging the continuation of dangerous behavior;

    g. Failing to intervene promptly to stop the rough tackling game once Defendant’s staff had actual or constructive notice of the danger;

    h. Failing to separate the older boys from younger children, including J.T., and failing to implement reasonable rules to prohibit unsafe and violent play;

    i. Failing to train, supervise, and monitor its staff adequately with respect to child supervision, risk recognition, and intervention in dangerous situations;

    j. Failing to adopt and/or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for safe gym use and supervision in an after‑school program serving children of varying ages and sizes;

    k. Failing to act as a reasonably prudent operator of an after‑school program for children would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

48. The risk that older children engaging in rough tackling on a hard gym floor could injure a younger child is obvious and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant knew or should have known of this risk.

49. Under Massachusetts law, foreseeability of harm is a central component of duty and breach. See, e.g., Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. at 147–50; Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. at 247–48.

50. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, as set forth above, were the direct and proximate cause of J.T.’s fall, concussion, loss of consciousness, and resulting injuries, and of Plaintiff’s associated economic damages.

51. Defendant’s negligence need not be the sole cause of Plaintiff’s injuries; it is sufficient that Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in bringing about those injuries. See, e.g., Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431 (cited with approval in Massachusetts).

52. Plaintiff and J.T. were at all material times acting reasonably and did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligence. Any contributory negligence, if found, would be comparatively assessed under G.L. c. 231, § 85, which provides that Plaintiff’s recovery shall be diminished only in proportion to any negligence attributable to Plaintiff or J.T., and entirely barred only if such negligence exceeds fifty percent (50%). Plaintiff and J.T. deny any negligence on their part.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.T. suffered the following injuries and damages:

    a. A concussion with loss of consciousness of approximately thirty (30) seconds;

    b. Head pain, headaches, dizziness, and other concussion‑related symptoms;

    c. Emotional distress, anxiety, and fear arising from the incident and its aftermath;

    d. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal child activities;

    e. Missed school days and associated educational disruption.

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:

    a. Medical expenses incurred on behalf of J.T. in an amount presently estimated at approximately Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), plus any additional amounts reasonably foreseeable in the future for follow‑up care and treatment;

    b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00);

    c. Additional out‑of‑pocket expenses associated with transportation, care, and treatment of J.T.;

    d. Emotional distress and mental anguish associated with witnessing and addressing his son’s injury and its consequences.

55. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment and quality of life, pursuant to Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 231.

56. Plaintiff’s claims are brought within the applicable statute of limitations for negligence actions in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 260, § 2A (three‑year limitation period for actions in tort).

57. To the extent applicable, Plaintiff invokes Mass. R. Civ. P. 8(a) and 9(g), and seeks all elements of damages available under Massachusetts law, including pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

                         V.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff James Thompson, individually and as parent and next friend of his minor son J.T., respectfully demands judgment against Defendant Brockton Community Center as follows:

A. For an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be within the jurisdictional limits of the Brockton District Court, including, without limitation:

   2. Lost wages incurred by Plaintiff, presently estimated at approximately $1,200.00, plus any additional amounts proven at trial;

   3. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life suffered by J.T. as a result of the concussion and its aftermath;

   4. Emotional distress and associated damages suffered by Plaintiff arising from his son’s injury and its effects;
