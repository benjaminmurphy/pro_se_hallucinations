RICHARD GREENE,

------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Maya Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Richard Greene (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maya Thompson is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been a residential tenant of Defendant at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. Defendant Richard Greene is an individual who, on information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”) and does business as a residential landlord in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under Massachusetts law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The Boston Municipal Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 1, 19 and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because the amount in controversy is within the Court’s jurisdictional limits and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Division, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there. See G.L. c. 223, § 2; G.L. c. 218, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about February 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a studio apartment at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

7. Plaintiff agreed to pay, and has paid, monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) to Defendant for the Premises.

8. Prior to entering into the tenancy, during a showing of the Premises, Plaintiff observed visible water stains on the ceiling of the apartment.

9. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the water stains and any prior leaks.

10. Defendant affirmatively represented to Plaintiff that the stains were from an old water leak that had been “totally fixed,” and that there was no ongoing leak problem.

11. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s representation that the leak had been repaired and that the Premises were fit for residential occupancy, and she agreed to enter into the tenancy based in part on that assurance.

12. After Plaintiff moved into the Premises and began her tenancy around February 15, 2022, the first major rainstorm resulted in active water leaking through the ceiling in substantially the same area as the prior water stains.

13. Water dripped from the ceiling into the living area of the studio. The leak has recurred during subsequent rainstorms over the approximately eight-month period Plaintiff has lived at the Premises.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the active leak and water intrusion and requested that Defendant repair the leak and remediate the resulting damage.

15. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant multiple times, orally and in writing, about the ongoing water intrusion, including after substantial rain events when the leak and damage worsened.

16. Despite repeated notice, Defendant has refused and/or failed to make timely and adequate repairs to stop the leak or to remedy the resulting damage.

17. Instead, Defendant has repeatedly dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints, characterizing the leak as a “minor cosmetic issue” and stating that Plaintiff knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.

18. The water intrusion has not been minor or cosmetic. During one particularly heavy storm, the leak intensified to the point that water from the ceiling soaked Plaintiff’s couch and dripped onto her coffee table.

19. During that storm, water ruined Plaintiff’s laptop, which had been left on the coffee table and was exposed to the leaking water. Plaintiff was forced to replace the laptop, at a cost of approximately Nine Hundred Dollars ($900).

20. The repeated water intrusion has created a persistent musty odor in the Premises, indicative of damp conditions and likely mold growth.

21. Following the onset of the musty smell and ongoing dampness, Plaintiff began experiencing headaches, which she reasonably believes are associated with mold or other environmental conditions caused by the persistent leak and moisture.

22. As a result of the damaged area of the apartment and the ongoing water intrusion risk, Plaintiff has had to move her bed away from the affected portion of the unit and is effectively living in only approximately half of the apartment.

23. The recurring leaks, damp conditions, musty odor, and associated health symptoms have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as a habitable dwelling.

24. Defendant has had actual and repeated notice of the condition and its impact on Plaintiff’s living situation, yet has failed to undertake reasonable and timely repairs to stop the leak and restore the Premises to a safe and habitable condition.

25. The ongoing leak and resulting conditions constitute a material interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and with her right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

26. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord, had the responsibility to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and in a condition fit for human habitation, including by preventing and repairing water leaks and associated conditions that threaten health and safety.

27. Defendant’s conduct, including his failure to repair after notice and his repeated minimization of the defect as merely “cosmetic,” has caused Plaintiff significant stress, inconvenience, loss of use of part of her home, and property damage.

28. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent to Defendant despite the impaired condition of the Premises and despite the substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the unit.

29. Plaintiff estimates that, at a minimum, she has suffered damages in the amount of approximately Nine Hundred Dollars ($900) for the destroyed laptop and associated personal property damage, in addition to loss of use and enjoyment and emotional distress.

30. Defendant’s actions and omissions, undertaken with knowledge of the ongoing water intrusion and its effects, have violated Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

31. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, protecting tenants from serious interferences with the use and enjoyment of the rented premises. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977).

33. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” and that a landlord who does so is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

34. A landlord’s failure to correct serious conditions affecting health or safety, after notice, can constitute an “indirect” interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–78 (1994); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

35. Under Massachusetts law, conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.), including chronic water leaks and conditions that may cause mold or dampness, can amount to a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment when the landlord fails to correct them after notice. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 200–01 (1973); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 282–83 (1994).

36. The State Sanitary Code requires that dwelling units be kept in good repair, in a clean and sanitary condition, and free of chronic dampness and water penetration. See 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.750.

37. Defendant’s failure and refusal to repair the ongoing ceiling leak, water intrusion, and resulting conditions, despite repeated notice from Plaintiff, constitute an “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. at 776–77; Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718.

38. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is substantial, not trivial or de minimis. Plaintiff has suffered repeated water leaks into her living area, property damage including the destruction of her laptop, persistent musty odors suggestive of mold, headaches, and the effective loss of use of a substantial portion of her small studio apartment.

39. Massachusetts courts have recognized that significant water leaks, chronic dampness, and environmental conditions impacting health and habitability can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–204 (1979) (serious code violations justify tenant remedies); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–05 (serious interference, including flooding, supports quiet enjoyment and emotional distress damages).

40. Defendant’s repeated characterization of the leak as a “minor cosmetic issue,” and his failure to investigate or undertake adequate repairs despite repeated notice, demonstrate a knowing and unreasonable disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory rights and living conditions.

41. Defendant’s conduct was at least negligent, and, in light of his repeated notice of the recurring water intrusion and resulting damage and health concerns, his inaction was willful, knowing, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. at 777–79; Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

42. Defendant’s failure to provide a habitable dwelling substantially deprived Plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of her home, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, and in derogation of the implied warranty of habitability recognized in Massachusetts law. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 200–02; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 199–204; Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 872–73 (1991).

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages including, but not limited to:

   a. Property damage, including the destruction of her laptop and damage to furniture and personal property;  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Premises;  
   c. Discomfort, inconvenience, and disruption of her home life; and  
   d. Physical symptoms, including headaches, reasonably associated with the damp and musty conditions.

44. G.L. c. 186, § 14 entitles Plaintiff to recover either (a) her actual and consequential damages, or (b) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

45. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500), so three months’ rent equals Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($4,500).

46. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages include at least approximately Nine Hundred Dollars ($900) in property damage to her laptop, plus additional unspecified damages for loss of use, discomfort, and associated harms.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover a minimum of three months’ rent (approximately $4,500), because that amount exceeds her presently quantified actual damages, as well as her reasonable costs of this action and any attorney’s fees she may incur. See Darmetko, 378 Mass. at 761–62; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. at 776–78.

48. Plaintiff also seeks all other relief available under Massachusetts law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including equitable relief to compel proper repair and remediation if the tenancy is ongoing and conditions persist.

E. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action, including filing fees and service costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;
