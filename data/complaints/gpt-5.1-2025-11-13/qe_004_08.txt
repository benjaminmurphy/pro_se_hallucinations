EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,

ROBERT SMITH,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this action against Defendant Robert Smith (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (the “Premises”). Plaintiff is and at all relevant times has been a residential tenant of the Premises.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Robert Smith is an individual who owns, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, including the Premises rented by Plaintiff, and does business as a residential landlord in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees.

5. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 239 and G.L. c. 223 because the Premises is located in Worcester, Massachusetts, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this county.

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and related provisions governing civil actions within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2020, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the Premises at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises since on or about June 1, 2020, and has paid monthly rent of approximately $1,200 to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times complied with her material obligations as a tenant, including payment of rent and keeping the Premises in a reasonably clean and sanitary condition.

10. Approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint (around September 2025), Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen at the Premises.

11. The mouse droppings have appeared on kitchen counters, in cabinets, and in areas where food is stored and prepared.

12. Promptly after noticing the mouse droppings, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the rodent infestation condition at the Premises.

13. After being notified, Defendant placed a few mouse traps in the Premises, and a small number of mice (approximately two) were caught.

14. Despite these minimal efforts, Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings in the kitchen on a regular basis, including on a weekly basis, indicating that the rodent problem persisted.

15. Plaintiff again notified Defendant that the rodent problem was ongoing and had not been resolved.

16. After further complaints, Defendant arranged for an exterminator to visit the Premises on a single occasion.

17. The exterminator, during that visit, informed Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive and ongoing treatment and measures in order to address the rodent infestation effectively.

18. Defendant, however, refused to authorize or undertake comprehensive treatment, stating that such measures were “overkill” and “too expensive.”

19. Defendant has repeatedly told Plaintiff that the presence of rodents and mouse droppings is “normal for older buildings” and has suggested that Plaintiff needs to keep her kitchen cleaner.

20. These statements are false, unreasonable, and insulting, particularly given that Plaintiff maintains the Premises, and specifically the kitchen, in a clean and orderly condition.

21. At no time did Defendant undertake a sustained, building-wide pest control program or otherwise take all reasonable steps to eliminate the rodent infestation as required by Massachusetts law and the State Sanitary Code.

22. The rodent infestation and repeated presence of mouse droppings in the kitchen have rendered Plaintiff’s kitchen unsafe, unsanitary, and unfit for normal and reasonable use.

23. Plaintiff has been forced to discard significant amounts of food that could reasonably have been contaminated by rodents or droppings, including any boxed or bagged food that was not sealed in rigid containers.

24. Over the course of approximately three months, Plaintiff has had to throw away food with a value of approximately two hundred dollars ($200.00).

25. Plaintiff has also been compelled to purchase plastic storage containers and related items in order to protect her food and mitigate the rodent problem, at an additional cost of approximately eighty dollars ($80.00).

26. The total out-of-pocket damages that Plaintiff has incurred, at minimum, as a direct result of the rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to properly address it are approximately two hundred eighty dollars ($280.00).

27. In addition to monetary losses, Plaintiff has suffered substantial discomfort, anxiety, distress, and inconvenience arising from the rodent infestation, including ongoing fear and concern about the safety and cleanliness of her kitchen and food.

28. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home has been materially and substantially interfered with by the rodent infestation, including her ability to cook, store food, and otherwise use the kitchen in a normal, reasonable, and healthy manner.

29. Defendant was aware of the infestation and its continuation over a period of months, but refused to undertake adequate remedial measures despite actual knowledge that Plaintiff continued to experience rodent activity and droppings.

30. Defendant’s inaction and refusal were not based on any impossibility but instead on his expressed view that more thorough extermination was “overkill” and “too expensive,” thereby putting his own financial convenience above his legal obligations and Plaintiff’s health and safety.

31. As the owner and landlord of the Premises, Defendant is responsible for complying with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and maintaining the Premises in compliance with G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including the duty to ensure that the Premises is free from rodent infestation.

32. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and related provisions, an owner is required to maintain the dwelling free from rodent infestation and to take all reasonable measures to exterminate rodents whenever conditions indicate such infestation.

33. The ongoing presence of rodent droppings in a kitchen is a condition that fails to meet the minimum standards of fitness for human habitation under the State Sanitary Code and constitutes a defect affecting health and safety.

34. Defendant’s failure and refusal to correct the rodent infestation, after notice and over an extended period, has rendered the Premises in violation of the State Sanitary Code and unfit for human habitation within the meaning of Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

35. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s statutory and common-law obligations to provide a habitable dwelling free from rodent infestation and to safeguard Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

36. By failing to remedy the rodent infestation and by refusing comprehensive extermination despite actual notice of continuing violations, Defendant materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

37. Such interference was willful within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, and at minimum occurred with reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s legal rights and of Defendant’s statutory obligations as a landlord.

38. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, loss of use and enjoyment of her home, and emotional distress and discomfort.

39. Plaintiff brings this action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable Massachusetts case law.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

40. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–39 above as if fully set forth herein.

41. At all relevant times, Plaintiff, as a residential tenant of the Premises, was entitled to the benefit of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment implied into her tenancy by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law.

42. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not… directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

43. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to freedom from serious interference with the use, occupancy, and enjoyment of the leased premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–17 (1977).

44. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment by permitting or failing to remedy conditions that materially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, especially conditions affecting health and safety. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 283–85 (1994); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982) (rescript).

45. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated where the landlord, by act or omission, creates or allows a condition that substantially impairs the character and value of the leased premises to the tenant. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716–17.

46. A landlord’s failure to correct known violations of the State Sanitary Code, after notice, may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–05; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–02 (1979).

47. Here, the repeated and ongoing presence of rodent droppings and infestation in Plaintiff’s kitchen over a period of months constitutes a substantial and serious interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

48. The rodent infestation at the Premises violates the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including, inter alia, 105 C.M.R. 410.550 (pest control and extermination) and related provisions requiring the maintenance of dwellings free of rodent infestation.

49. Under Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 190–98 (1973), and subsequent cases, the landlord’s obligation to maintain premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code is part of the implied warranty of habitability and is directly relevant to the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

50. Defendant, as owner and landlord, had actual knowledge of the rodent problem after Plaintiff’s initial and subsequent complaints, and after being informed by the exterminator that more extensive measures were necessary.

51. Despite this knowledge, Defendant refused to undertake comprehensive extermination or any adequate long-term corrective measures, instead dismissing the problem as “normal for older buildings” and “too expensive” to address fully.

52. Defendant’s refusal to properly address the rodent infestation, and his decision to limit treatment despite knowledge of ongoing unsanitary and unsafe conditions, was at least reckless, and, in light of the continuing complaints, constituted a willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

53. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s intentional or reckless failure to correct serious defects or code violations after notice can amount to a “direct or indirect” interference with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–05; Doe, 417 Mass. at 283–85; Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983; Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

54. The rodent infestation substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use her kitchen for ordinary living activities, including safe food storage, meal preparation, and eating, and caused her to suffer recurring anxiety and distress about the conditions of her home.

55. The interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment was not trivial or momentary, but continuous and ongoing over a period of approximately three months or longer, and remains unresolved as of the date of this Complaint.

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of food and groceries reasonably valued at approximately two hundred dollars ($200.00);

   b. Costs of purchasing plastic storage containers and related items totaling approximately eighty dollars ($80.00);

   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly the kitchen, during the period of rodent infestation;

   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, inconvenience, and discomfort associated with living in a rodent-infested dwelling and with the persistent presence of rodent droppings in areas where food is stored and prepared.

57. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

58. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is approximately one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00); three months’ rent therefore totals three thousand six hundred dollars ($3,600.00).

59. Plaintiff is entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 to recover, at minimum, three months’ rent ($3,600.00) as statutory damages, or her actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, together with reasonable costs of this action and any attorney’s fees if she later retains counsel.

60. Plaintiff also seeks all other relief necessary and appropriate to remedy Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including prospective injunctive-type relief to the extent this Court deems such relief available and appropriate, requiring Defendant to abate the rodent infestation and bring the Premises into full compliance with the State Sanitary Code.

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITIES (STATUTES AND CASES)

61. Plaintiff’s claims and requested relief are grounded in, inter alia, the following Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and cases, each of which supports and/or informs the claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14:

   a. G.L. c. 186, § 14 (statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment; liability for interference with quiet enjoyment and provision for damages of three months’ rent or actual damages, plus costs and attorney’s fees);

   b. G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L (authorizing and defining the State Sanitary Code and the requirement that dwellings be fit for human habitation);

   c. 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation), including 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and related provisions concerning extermination of rodents and vermin;

   d. Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (establishing the implied warranty of habitability in residential tenancies and connecting habitability to compliance with the State Sanitary Code);

   e. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (discussing a landlord’s obligation to maintain premises and the impact of code violations);

   f. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (defining substantial interference with use and enjoyment as a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment);

   g. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (holding landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment due to failure to abate serious conditions; recognizing that failure to cure code violations can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment and that emotional distress damages may be recoverable);

   h. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (applying G.L. c. 186, § 14 and explaining that landlord’s failure to act in the face of known conditions can constitute a violation of quiet enjoyment);

   i. Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (rescript) (confirming that landlord’s failure to correct known defects and code violations may support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment);

   j. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (discussing scope of recovery under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and confirming availability of statutory damages and attorney’s fees);

   k. Additional authorities on habitability and landlord obligations, including but not limited to: McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977) (connection between code violations and breach of landlord’s obligations); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994) (reaffirming tenant protections under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law).

62. These statutes, regulations, and cases collectively recognize that a landlord’s failure to address serious and unsanitary conditions such as rodent infestation, after notice, constitutes a substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises and supports an award of statutory and actual damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.
