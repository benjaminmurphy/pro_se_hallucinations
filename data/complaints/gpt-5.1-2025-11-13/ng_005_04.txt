JORDAN SMITH,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Civil Action No. __________

MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE – PROPERTY DAMAGE)  

Plaintiff Jordan Smith (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this civil action against Defendant Michael Johnson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Johnson is an individual who also resides at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and is Plaintiff’s neighbor in a duplex at that address.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, or, alternatively, because Plaintiff elects to file in the Superior Court as permitted by Massachusetts law.

4. Venue is proper in Hampden County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the events and occurrences giving rise to this action took place in Hampden County, Massachusetts, specifically at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA, and because both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Hampden County.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant under G.L. c. 223A, § 2 because Defendant is domiciled in Massachusetts and the cause of action arises from acts and omissions occurring within the Commonwealth.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a duplex property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

7. Plaintiff and Defendant share a common driveway at the property, which both parties use for ingress, egress, and vehicle parking.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder that he routinely kept and stored outside in the shared driveway area.

9. Defendant customarily leaned this tall aluminum extension ladder, in an unsecured manner, against a wooden fence located immediately adjacent to the portion of the driveway where Plaintiff regularly parked his vehicle.

10. The ladder was tall, heavy, and made of aluminum, and when leaned unsecured against the fence, it presented a foreseeable risk that it could be blown or knocked over, particularly in windy conditions.

11. Prior to the incident, Plaintiff observed the ladder in this precarious position on multiple occasions and became concerned that it might fall over onto his vehicle.

12. On at least two separate occasions before March 15, 2023, Plaintiff spoke directly to Defendant and expressed specific concern that the ladder could fall, especially on windy days, and damage Plaintiff’s car or otherwise create a dangerous condition.

13. During those conversations, Plaintiff requested that Defendant either properly secure the ladder (e.g., by tying it down) or move it to a safer location away from the area where vehicles were parked and people would be walking.

14. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would tie the ladder down or move it, but despite these assurances, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to secure or relocate the ladder.

15. Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the ladder left it leaning unsecured against the wooden fence in close proximity to where Plaintiff regularly parked and maneuvered his vehicle.

16. On or about March 15, 2023, a particularly windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, Plaintiff arrived home and began backing his vehicle into the shared driveway at 123 Elm Street.

17. At or about that time, a gust of wind struck the unsecured aluminum ladder.

18. Because the ladder was not tied, anchored, or otherwise reasonably secured, the gust of wind knocked the ladder off the fence and caused it to fall directly onto Plaintiff’s vehicle.

19. The ladder crashed onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle with significant force.

20. As a direct and proximate result of the impact from the falling ladder, the hood of Plaintiff’s vehicle was dented and the windshield cracked.

21. The damage to the hood and windshield rendered Plaintiff’s vehicle cosmetically damaged and unsafe to operate without repair due to the compromised windshield.

22. Plaintiff promptly sought repair services for his vehicle. The necessary repairs included replacement of the cracked windshield and bodywork to repair and refinish the dented hood.

23. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket costs, including but not limited to:  
    a. An insurance deductible payment for the damage to the vehicle; and  
    b. Vehicle rental expenses while Plaintiff’s car was in the repair shop for more than one week.

24. Plaintiff’s vehicle was unavailable for his normal use while it was being repaired, causing inconvenience, loss of use, and additional expense.

25. Plaintiff has not incurred medical expenses or lost wages as a result of this incident; Plaintiff’s claimed damages are for property damage and associated economic losses (including deductible, rental car costs, and loss of use of the vehicle), together with interest, costs, and such additional compensation as the Court deems just and proper.

26. The harm to Plaintiff’s vehicle was reasonably foreseeable given the nature of the ladder, its unsecured position, the shared nature of the driveway, and the typical weather conditions in Springfield, Massachusetts, including gusty and windy days in March.

27. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that leaving a tall, heavy aluminum ladder leaning unsecured against a fence in a shared driveway, adjacent to parked vehicles and an area of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of property damage and injury.

28. Defendant was expressly warned by Plaintiff of the specific danger that the ladder could fall and damage Plaintiff’s car or otherwise cause harm, yet Defendant remained indifferent and failed to take reasonable precautions.

29. At all relevant times, Plaintiff acted with due care, operated his vehicle in a reasonable and prudent manner, and had no ability to control or secure Defendant’s ladder.

30. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the creation of the dangerous condition constituted by the unsecured ladder and had no legal right to alter, move, or dispose of Defendant’s property.

31. Defendant’s acts and omissions in storing and maintaining the ladder in the described manner were careless, unreasonable, and in violation of the duty of reasonable care he owed to Plaintiff as a neighbor and co-user of the shared driveway.

32. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage and economic losses, including, but not limited to, the cost of repairs to the vehicle, the insurance deductible, vehicle rental expenses, loss of use, and other incidental costs, all to be determined at trial.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence**

33. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully set forth herein.

34. Under Massachusetts common law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 51 (1983); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

35. This duty of reasonable care applies to the maintenance, storage, and control of one’s property where it may foreseeably create a risk of harm to others. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147–49 (duty regarding dangerous instrumentalities on property); *Yee v. Mass. State Police*, 481 Mass. 290, 297 (2019).

36. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, storage, and placement of the aluminum ladder in the shared driveway at 123 Elm Street so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff’s person or property.

37. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to act reasonably once put on actual notice that the unsecured ladder created a specific, foreseeable risk of falling and damaging Plaintiff’s vehicle or otherwise causing harm. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 148–49 (duty informed by foreseeable risk and notice); *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267–68 (1986).

38. Massachusetts follows the general negligence standard that a person must act as a reasonable person of ordinary prudence would under like circumstances. See *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 283; see also *Mullins*, 389 Mass. at 51–52.

39. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in multiple respects, including, but not limited to:

   a. Failing to properly secure the tall aluminum ladder (e.g., tying it down, anchoring it, or otherwise stabilizing it) in an area subject to wind and vehicle and pedestrian traffic;

   b. Failing to relocate the ladder to a safer area away from where vehicles were parked and used regularly;

   c. Storing the ladder in a precarious vertical position, leaning against a fence, in a manner that a reasonable person would recognize as likely to fall under windy conditions;

   d. Ignoring and disregarding Plaintiff’s specific warnings and complaints about the danger posed by the unsecured ladder;

   e. Failing to inspect, monitor, and correct the obviously unsafe condition of the ladder in the shared driveway area;

   f. Continuing to maintain the dangerous condition despite the foreseeable risk that the ladder could fall and damage Plaintiff’s vehicle or injure persons using the driveway.

40. The risk that a tall, unsecured ladder could be knocked over by wind and fall onto a nearby vehicle was a natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s conduct, and thus within the scope of the risk that made Defendant’s conduct negligent. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996); *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).

41. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, as described above, constitute a failure to act with the ordinary care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the circumstances, and therefore amount to negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–49; *Banaghan v. Dewey*, 340 Mass. 73, 80 (1959).

42. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the ladder falling on March 15, 2023, and of the resulting property damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle.

43. But for Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the ladder, the ladder would not have fallen onto Plaintiff’s vehicle and Plaintiff would not have suffered the property damage and economic losses described herein. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–96 (1987) (causation standard); *McLaughlin v. Bernstein*, 356 Mass. 219, 226 (1969).

44. Plaintiff did not engage in any negligent conduct that caused or contributed to the ladder falling. Plaintiff was simply backing his vehicle into the shared driveway in a normal, careful manner when the wind knocked the unsecured ladder over.

45. To the extent any comparative negligence is argued, Massachusetts follows a modified comparative negligence rule under G.L. c. 231, § 85, permitting Plaintiff to recover so long as Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, is not greater than the total negligence of Defendant. Plaintiff denies any negligence and alleges that Defendant’s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the harm.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:

   a. Damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, including a dented hood and cracked windshield, requiring repair and replacement;

   b. Out-of-pocket payment of an automobile insurance deductible;

   c. Rental car costs and related expenses while Plaintiff’s vehicle was in the repair shop for more than one week;

   d. Loss of use of Plaintiff’s vehicle during the repair period; and

   e. Other incidental and consequential economic damages, all according to proof at trial.

47. Under Massachusetts law, a negligent tortfeasor is liable for all damages that are the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act. See *Wallace v. Ludwig*, 292 Mass. 251, 256 (1935); *Vosburgh v. Med. Prof. Ins. Ass’n*, 376 Mass. 757, 766 (1978).

48. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant the full amount of his property damage and related economic losses, together with statutory interest, costs, and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions).

---

### V. DAMAGES

49. Plaintiff estimates, subject to proof, that his total property damage and associated economic loss (including but not limited to vehicle repair costs represented by the insurance deductible, windshield replacement, bodywork to the hood, rental car expenses, and incidental costs) exceeds $7,500.

50. Plaintiff seeks an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but in an amount within the jurisdiction of this Court, plus statutory prejudgment interest, costs, and any other relief the Court deems appropriate.

---

### VI. APPLICABLE LAW (STATUTES AND AUTHORITIES)

51. Plaintiff’s claim is governed by Massachusetts negligence law, including, without limitation:

   a. G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence);  
   b. G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions);  
   c. G.L. c. 212, § 4 (jurisdiction of the Superior Court);  
   d. G.L. c. 223 and c. 223A (venue and personal jurisdiction); and  
   e. Common-law negligence principles as articulated in *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996); *Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101 (1978); *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790 (1987); *Wallace v. Ludwig*, 292 Mass. 251 (1935); *Morgan v. Lalumiere*, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986); *Banaghan v. Dewey*, 340 Mass. 73 (1959); and related authorities.
