JESSICA THOMPSON,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL SMITH,  
 Defendant.  
______________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
______________________________  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emma Smith (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Liam Smith (date of birth: __________, age 6) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith (“Defendant” or “Father”), is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3. The parties are the parents of the Children and are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and/or G.L. c. 209, § 37, and/or G.L. c. 215, § 6, as applicable, for modification of a prior custody and parenting-time order of this Court.

5. The Norfolk Probate and Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter, as it entered the original judgment regarding custody and parenting time on or about May 15, 2021 (the “Original Judgment” or “Existing Order”).

6. Venue is proper in Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the prior order was entered here and the parties and the Children reside, or have resided, within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6.

### III. PRIOR ORDER

7. On or about May 15, 2021, the Norfolk Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment and related orders governing legal and physical custody of the Children and establishing a parenting-time schedule (the “May 15, 2021 Judgment”).

8. Under the May 15, 2021 Judgment, the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the Children.

9. Under the May 15, 2021 Judgment, the Defendant has parenting time on alternating weekends and one midweek visit each week.

10. At the time the May 15, 2021 Judgment was entered, neither parent was in a serious relationship or cohabiting with a partner, and the Judgment contains no specific provisions regarding the presence of new romantic partners, third-party caregivers, or household members during the Defendant’s parenting time.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

11. Since the entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the Children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Ryan v. Brigham*, 358 Mass. 200 (1970).

12. After entry of the Existing Order, the Defendant entered into a romantic relationship with, and now resides with, an individual (hereinafter, “the Cohabiting Partner”) who has a criminal history that includes, upon information and belief, a conviction (or charges) for assault and battery and who has been the subject of a past restraining order issued at the request of a previous girlfriend.

13. The Cohabiting Partner’s criminal record for assault and battery, and the existence of a prior abuse prevention order (restraining order) against him, reflect a documented history of violence or threatening behavior that was not known to the Court and did not exist as part of the factual context at the time of the May 15, 2021 Judgment.

14. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Cohabiting Partner frequently yells in their presence, slams doors, and exhibits angry, volatile behavior while they are in the Defendant’s home.

15. The Children further reported an incident in which the Cohabiting Partner grabbed one of the Children by the arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark.

16. On at least one occasion, a neighbor called the police to the Defendant’s residence during a loud and heated argument involving the Cohabiting Partner while the Children were present in the home.

17. The foregoing conduct and events demonstrate that the environment in the Defendant’s home has become unstable, volatile, and potentially dangerous to the Children’s physical safety and emotional well-being, and is materially different from the circumstances that existed when the May 15, 2021 Judgment was entered.

18. The introduction of a household member with a history of assaultive behavior and a restraining order, combined with actual incidents of intimidation, physical contact with a Child resulting in a mark, and police involvement during the Children’s presence, constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

19. These new circumstances directly affect the Children’s safety and welfare and therefore warrant reconsideration and modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

20. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination in Massachusetts is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

21. The Court has broad equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6 to make such orders as are necessary to protect the health, safety, and well-being of minor children subject to its jurisdiction. See also *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).

22. Massachusetts courts recognize that exposure of children to domestic violence, severe conflict, or abusive or threatening behavior in the home is contrary to their best interests and may warrant restrictions on parenting time or the imposition of safeguards. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

23. G.L. c. 208, § 31A and G.L. c. 209A reflect the strong public policy of the Commonwealth to protect children from abuse and domestic violence and to consider evidence of such conduct when fashioning custody and visitation orders.

24. The Children’s reports of being frightened by the Cohabiting Partner’s yelling and door-slamming, the incident of physical grabbing resulting in a mark, and the neighbor’s call to the police during a loud argument, indicate that the Children are being subjected to an environment of instability and potential abuse while in the Defendant’s care.

25. The Plaintiff is concerned, based on the Children’s statements and the known history of the Cohabiting Partner, that the Children are at risk of both physical and emotional harm during the Defendant’s parenting time if the Cohabiting Partner remains present and unsupervised around the Children.

26. In light of the above, maintaining the current parenting-time arrangement without modification would not adequately protect the Children’s best interests, and would fail to give due weight to the changed circumstances and the heightened risk to their safety and emotional welfare. See *Rosenberg v. Rosenberg*, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (1992); *Hersey v. Hersey*, 271 Mass. 545 (1930).

27. Reasonable and narrowly tailored modifications, such as prohibiting the Cohabiting Partner’s presence during the Defendant’s parenting time with the Children, or requiring supervised parenting time for the Defendant while the Cohabiting Partner remains in the home, will better serve the Children’s best interests while preserving their relationship with the Defendant in a safe and appropriate manner. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).

### VI. BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

28. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may revise and alter its earlier judgment relative to the care and custody of minor children upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where such modification is in the best interests of the children.

29. The emergence of the Cohabiting Partner, his documented history of assault and a prior restraining order, the Children’s reported experiences of fear and physical grabbing, and the involvement of law enforcement during an argument, all constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment.

30. The requested modifications are directly and narrowly related to the changed circumstances and are designed to protect the Children’s physical and emotional safety while allowing continued contact with the Defendant under safer conditions.

31. Under Massachusetts law, when post-judgment circumstances show that the existing order no longer adequately protects the best interests of the children, the Court not only may, but should, modify the order accordingly. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Ryan v. Brigham*, 358 Mass. 200 (1970).

32. The Plaintiff therefore respectfully requests that the Court exercise its authority under G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6; and related case law to modify the existing custody and parenting-time provisions of the May 15, 2021 Judgment.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION AND RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment, specifically including:

   1. The Defendant’s decision to reside with a Cohabiting Partner who has a criminal record for assault and battery and has been the subject of a prior restraining order;  
   2. The Children’s reports of frequent yelling, door-slamming, and volatile behavior by the Cohabiting Partner in their presence;  
   3. The incident in which the Cohabiting Partner grabbed one of the Children hard enough to leave a mark; and  
   4. The involvement of the police at the Defendant’s residence during a loud argument while the Children were present.

B. Find and rule that, in light of these changed circumstances, the current parenting-time arrangement does not adequately protect the Children’s best interests and that modification is necessary and appropriate under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law.

C. Modify the May 15, 2021 Judgment to provide that:

   1. The Defendant shall continue to have parenting time as scheduled (alternating weekends and one midweek visit) only on the condition that the Cohabiting Partner is not present in the home or in the physical vicinity of the Children at any time during the Defendant’s parenting time;  

   **OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE**

   2. The Defendant’s parenting time shall be supervised by an agreed-upon third party, a professional visitation center, or such other supervised visitation arrangement as the Court may order, for so long as the Cohabiting Partner resides with the Defendant or is involved in the Defendant’s household;  

   3. The Defendant shall not permit the Cohabiting Partner to have unsupervised contact with the Children under any circumstances;  

   4. The Defendant shall promptly inform the Plaintiff and the Court of any further police involvement, criminal charges, or restraining orders involving the Cohabiting Partner or any other adult residing in the Defendant’s household; and  

   5. The Court may impose any reasonable conditions or safeguards, including but not limited to counseling, parenting education, or anger management for the Defendant and/or the Cohabiting Partner, and may schedule periodic review hearings to monitor compliance and the Children’s safety.

D. Award the Plaintiff such further and other relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor Children.

Respectfully submitted,
