---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) to Defendant for the Premises.

9. At all times relevant, Defendant was the landlord and person responsible for maintaining the common areas and building systems at 123 Main Street, including the main entry door and its locking mechanism.

10. The main entry door to the building is a common-area entrance that provides the primary access from the public way to the interior of the building and to Plaintiff’s Premises.

11. For at least approximately two months prior to the date of this Complaint, the main entry door lock has been broken and does not latch properly, such that the door can be pushed open by anyone from the outside without use of a key or other security device.

12. Because the main entry door lock does not function properly, the building has been and remains insecure, allowing unauthorized persons to enter the building at will.

13. Approximately two months before the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the main entry door lock was broken and did not latch properly.

14. Defendant acknowledged the problem and represented to Plaintiff that he would fix the lock.

15. Despite this representation, Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the lock, and the condition has continued.

16. Plaintiff reminded Defendant at least two additional times after her initial complaint that the lock was still broken and requested that Defendant remedy the condition.

17. Defendant has persistently failed to take reasonable steps to repair or replace the lock, or otherwise to secure the building entrance, despite having actual notice of the problem for an extended period of time.

18. On or about one month prior to the date of this Complaint, one or more unknown individuals entered the building through the unsecured main entry door and went through tenants’ mail and packages located in the common areas and hallways.

19. During this incident, Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120), was stolen from the hallway outside her Premises.

20. Plaintiff did not authorize any unknown person to enter the building, and such persons would not have been able to enter as easily if the main entry door lock had been functioning properly.

21. After the incident involving mail and package tampering, Plaintiff observed evidence that one or more unknown persons had been sleeping in the building’s basement, including personal items and indications of overnight stays.

22. The presence of unauthorized persons in the building and basement has caused Plaintiff to fear for her personal safety and the security of her home and belongings.

23. The broken main entry door lock, combined with Defendant’s failure to repair it over an extended period after notice, has substantially impaired the safety, security, and habitability of the Premises and the building’s common areas.

24. As a direct result of the building’s lack of security and Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff purchased a security camera for her apartment door and installed a higher-security deadbolt lock on her own unit door, incurring out-of-pocket expenses of approximately Two Hundred Dollars ($200).

25. Plaintiff also suffered the loss of her stolen package, valued at approximately One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120), which she would not have lost but for the defective security of the building.

26. Plaintiff has experienced ongoing stress, anxiety, and loss of peace of mind in her home due to unauthorized persons entering the building and the evidence of intruders in the basement.

27. Plaintiff reasonably expected, and was legally entitled to, a secure common entrance and building conditions that do not unreasonably expose her to criminal activity or intrusion into the building.

28. Plaintiff has at all relevant times acted reasonably and has not caused or contributed to the broken condition of the main entry door lock.

29. Defendant has the responsibility under Massachusetts law and under the tenancy to maintain the common areas, including the main entry door and lock, in a safe and secure condition.

30. Defendant’s repeated failure to repair the main entry door lock after multiple notices from Plaintiff constitutes an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and her ability to safely and quietly enjoy the Premises.

31. Plaintiff has determined that, based on her losses and the nature of Defendant’s conduct, she is seeking damages of approximately Three Hundred Twenty Dollars ($320) in this action.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

32. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–31 above as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease and tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and G.L. c. 186, § 14 imposes liability on a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the tenant.

34. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any lessor or landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

35. Massachusetts courts have recognized that the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants not only against formal evictions, but also against serious, substantial, and unreasonable interferences with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including conditions in the common areas and building systems that materially affect habitability or safety. See, e.g.:

   a. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982);  
   b. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977);  
   c. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997);  
   d. *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  
   e. *Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994);  
   f. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979);  
   g. *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973);  
   h. *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987);  
   i. *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005);  
   j. *Lowell Housing Auth. v. Save-Mor Furniture Stores, Inc.*, 346 Mass. 426 (1963).

36. The covenant of quiet enjoyment and G.L. c. 186, § 14 apply to residential tenants such as Plaintiff and to landlords such as Defendant. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03; *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 716–19.

37. A landlord’s failure to maintain building systems and common areas in a condition that reasonably safeguards the tenant from foreseeable intrusions, hazards, or serious interference may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 284–86 (landlord liability for foreseeably unsafe conditions in common areas); *Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 789–91 (landlord responsibility for conditions substantially impairing quiet enjoyment).

38. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, had an obligation, arising from statute and common law, to maintain the common areas, including the main entrance and door lock, in a reasonably safe, secure, and habitable condition. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 239, § 8A; *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–203.

39. Defendant had actual notice for at least two months that the main entry door lock was broken and that the door could be pushed open from the outside without a key, thus compromising the security of the building and of Plaintiff’s home.

40. Despite repeated notice and requests by Plaintiff, Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the lock or otherwise to secure the main building entrance.

41. Defendant’s inaction persisted after it became reasonably foreseeable that unauthorized persons would enter the building and that such condition would materially and adversely affect tenants’ security and quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

42. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to remedy the broken lock and secure the building entrance, unauthorized persons entered the building through the unsecured main door, went through tenants’ mail and packages, and stole Plaintiff’s package worth approximately $120.

43. As a further direct result of Defendant’s failure to secure the building, Plaintiff discovered evidence that unknown individuals had been sleeping in the basement of the building, thereby increasing the risk of confrontation, theft, or harm and contributing to Plaintiff’s fear and anxiety within her own home.

44. The ongoing inability to rely on a secure, locking main entry door has caused Plaintiff to live in a state of heightened fear, stress, and worry, which substantially and unreasonably interferes with her ability to use and enjoy her home in peace.

45. These conditions constitute a “serious interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises under Massachusetts law. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (severe and continuing interference constitutes breach); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 716–19.

46. Plaintiff’s losses and harms were the natural and probable consequences of Defendant’s failure to maintain the main entry lock and to secure the building, and they were reasonably foreseeable to Defendant once Defendant was informed of the broken lock and the resulting lack of security.

47. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, taken together, amount to a direct and/or indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

48. Defendant’s breach includes, without limitation:

   a. Failing to timely repair or replace the broken main entry door lock after multiple notices;  
   b. Maintaining the building in a condition that allowed unauthorized persons to enter and remain;  
   c. Failing to take reasonable safety and security measures after being made aware of intrusions and mail/package tampering; and  
   d. Minimizing and dismissing Plaintiff’s safety concerns as “overreacting,” rather than taking corrective action.

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. The loss of her stolen package, valued at approximately $120;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $200 for a personal security camera and improved deadbolt lock, incurred to compensate for Defendant’s failure to maintain a secure building entrance;  
   c. Emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of peace of mind in her home arising from the presence of unauthorized persons in the building and basement and the continuing lack of security at the main entry.

50. Massachusetts law provides that a tenant whose quiet enjoyment is interfered with in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 is entitled to recover either (1) actual and consequential damages, or (2) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

51. Three months’ rent for Plaintiff’s Premises, at $1,500 per month, is $4,500, which is greater than Plaintiff’s currently pleaded out-of-pocket losses of approximately $320.

52. Plaintiff, who is self-represented, seeks at this time the actual damages she has specifically identified and quantified, totaling approximately $320, and reserves all rights to seek any additional remedies or statutory multipliers to which she may be entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law.

53. Defendant’s conduct as alleged herein constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to damages and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
