v.  

DAVID BROWN,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, David Brown (“Defendant” or “Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Sofia Brown.

2. The Defendant, David Brown, upon information and belief, is an individual presently residing in, or intending imminently to reside in, the State of New Hampshire, and is the father of the minor child, Sofia Brown.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, Sofia Brown (date of birth omitted here for privacy; to be supplied under separate confidential filing as necessary), age 8.

4. On or about March 15, 2021, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court (Woburn) entered a custody and parenting time judgment/order (the “2021 Judgment”) governing legal custody, physical custody, parenting time, and related matters concerning the minor child.

5. Under the 2021 Judgment, the Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody of the minor child, with the Defendant having parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend (alternating weekends), all premised on both parents residing in relatively close geographic proximity to each other and to the child’s school in the Cambridge area.

6. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, § 28A; G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the continuing jurisdiction principles described in G.L. c. 209B (Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act), because Massachusetts entered the original custody judgment and the child and Mother remain residents of Massachusetts.

7. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and applicable venue rules, as the existing custody order was issued here and the child primarily resides within this Court’s jurisdiction.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

8. The 2021 Judgment provides for primary physical custody of Sofia with the Plaintiff, and parenting time with the Defendant on Wednesdays (including a midweek overnight) and every other weekend, with exchanges occurring locally and with the mutual understanding and factual predicate that both parents resided in the Cambridge area and that Sofia attended a local school nearby.

9. At the time of the 2021 Judgment, both parents lived in or near Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the minor child attended a local school such that the Wednesday overnight and alternating weekend schedule was practical, minimally disruptive, and consistent with the child’s best interests.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, warranting modification of the existing parenting-time schedule pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant caselaw, including but not limited to *Schuh v. Schuh*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 110 (2018); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

11. Specifically, the Defendant now seeks to relocate his residence from the Cambridge area to New Hampshire to pursue a job opportunity, while maintaining the existing 2021 Judgment schedule unchanged.

12. The contemplated or actual relocation to New Hampshire significantly increases the travel distance and time between the Defendant’s residence and the minor child’s home and school. The anticipated average drive is approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in typical traffic.

13. The 2021 Judgment and its parenting-time schedule were expressly and implicitly based on the parties’ then-existing proximity to each other and to the child’s school. The assumptions underlying that schedule are no longer accurate or reasonable given the Defendant’s relocation.

14. The increased travel time required for Wednesday midweek overnights would necessitate the minor child regularly engaging in lengthy late-afternoon or evening drives to New Hampshire, followed by very early morning drives of similar length to return to her Massachusetts school.

15. The minor child is 8 years old and is enrolled in local school and after-school activities in the Cambridge area. The midweek overnight, if maintained with the New Hampshire commute, would significantly disrupt her sleep, education, and extracurricular involvement.

16. The Plaintiff has observed, and upon information and belief will testify, that Sofia has already begun to exhibit anxiety and distress about the prospect of these long drives, especially on school nights, and about missing or being forced to reduce participation in her existing after-school activities.

17. These changed travel demands and associated emotional consequences for the child materially affect the child’s daily routine, emotional well-being, and educational stability, and constitute a material and substantial change of circumstances under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–86; *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

18. The increased distance and travel demands were not reasonably contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the 2021 Judgment and are fundamentally inconsistent with the assumptions that justified a midweek overnight parenting-time schedule.

19. Because the child is now older, more involved in school and structured after-school activities, and more sensitive to disruptions in her routine and rest, the impact of the Defendant’s relocation and the long commute is substantially greater now than it would have been at earlier ages, reinforcing the existence of a material change in circumstances. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (child’s developmental needs central to best-interest analysis); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

20. Any modification of a custody or parenting-time order in Massachusetts must serve the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 181–82; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44; *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

21. In evaluating the best interests of the child, Massachusetts courts consider, inter alia, the child’s emotional, physical, and developmental needs; the child’s relationship with each parent; educational stability; and the practical impact of proposed parenting arrangements. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–45; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

22. The best-interests standard does not guarantee either parent a particular quantum of parenting time; rather, it demands a parenting schedule that maximizes the child’s welfare, stability, and healthy relationship with both parents. See *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 681–83; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 547–48 (2010).

23. The continued enforcement of a Wednesday midweek overnight in New Hampshire, with a ninety-minute (or more) commute each way, is inconsistent with Sofia’s best interests because it:

   a. Substantially interferes with her sleep schedule before school days;

   b. Increases her stress and anxiety associated with long car rides and early wake-ups;

   c. Risks tardiness, fatigue, and diminished engagement at school;

   d. Undermines her ability to participate consistently in after-school programs and activities in her community; and

   e. Reduces the predictability and stability of her weekday routine, which is especially important at her age.

24. Lengthy midweek travel also raises concerns for the child’s physical comfort and safety, particularly in winter weather conditions common to New England, and may expose her to additional risk on dark, early-morning or late-evening drives, further undermining her welfare.

25. While the Plaintiff recognizes and supports the child’s continued relationship with the Defendant, meaningful contact can be preserved and even enhanced through a modified weekend-centered schedule that avoids disruptive midweek overnights, rather than by forcing a schedule that is logistically impractical and detrimental to the child’s well-being. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 186–88 (balancing parental rights and child’s best interests); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 710–12.

26. A restructured parenting-time schedule that eliminates the midweek overnight and reasonably adjusts weekend parenting time to account for the increased distance is consistent with Massachusetts law and the child’s best interests, as it will:

   a. Maintain Sofia’s primary residence, school, and community in Massachusetts;

   b. Protect her weekday routine, sleep, and educational stability;

   c. Continue to provide ample, quality parenting time with the Defendant on weekends when the commute is less burdensome; and

   d. Reduce anxiety connected with travel and missed activities, thereby supporting her emotional health.

27. Under Massachusetts law, where a material change in circumstances is shown and the requested modification promotes the best interests of the child, the Court has both the authority and the responsibility to modify custody and parenting-time provisions. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. at 116–18; *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 681–83; *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

### V. STATUTORY AND CASE LAW BASIS FOR RELIEF

28. G.L. c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Probate and Family Court to revise and alter judgments concerning the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children as circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require, upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and the child’s best interests.

29. G.L. c. 208, § 31 sets forth the standard that custody and parenting determinations are to be made in the best interests of the child, considering the child’s welfare, happiness, and development, as further articulated in *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44, and *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

30. Consistent with these statutes and the cases cited above—including, without limitation, *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 110; *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704; *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219; and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899—the circumstances described herein warrant modification of the existing parenting-time provisions.

31. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific material change (the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting impact on the midweek overnight and related travel), while preserving and supporting the child’s ongoing relationship with both parents.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

32. The Plaintiff does not seek to change the existing award of primary physical custody to her under the 2021 Judgment, but rather seeks an adjustment of the parenting-time schedule to reflect the increased distance and to safeguard the child’s best interests.

33. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight with the Defendant, in light of the excessive commute and its adverse effects on Sofia during the school week;

   b. Convert the Wednesday parenting time, if the Court determines that midweek contact should continue, to a reasonable non-overnight visit or virtual contact (e.g., video or telephone call), scheduled in a manner that does not interfere with Sofia’s sleep, schoolwork, or after-school activities;

   c. Adjust the alternating weekend schedule so that the Defendant continues to have regular and substantial weekend parenting time, with exchanges scheduled at reasonable times to minimize disruption to the child (for example, from Friday after school or early evening through Sunday late afternoon or early evening, or such other weekend structure as the Court deems appropriate given the travel distance);

   d. Clarify that the parenting schedule is premised on the Defendant’s residence being in New Hampshire (or similar distance), and that any further substantial change in the distance, commute, or logistics impacting the child may constitute a basis for further modification;

   e. Order such additional or alternative parenting-time provisions as the Court deems just and proper to promote Sofia’s stability during the school week and her continued strong relationship with both parents.

34. The Plaintiff believes and will testify that this requested modification is in Sofia’s best interests, promotes her stability and well-being, and constitutes a reasonable and necessary response to the material and substantial change in circumstances created by the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the March 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time judgment;

2. Find and rule that modification of the existing parenting-time provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Sofia Brown;

3. Issue a modified custody and parenting-time order providing, at minimum, that:

   a. The Wednesday midweek overnight with the Defendant is eliminated;

   b. Any midweek contact, if ordered, shall be limited to non-overnight, local, or virtual contact that does not materially disrupt the child’s school, sleep, or after-school activities;

   c. The Defendant shall continue to have parenting time on alternating weekends, with the specific schedule adjusted as necessary to accommodate the increased travel distance while maintaining the child’s stability and routines;

4. Grant such further or different relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
