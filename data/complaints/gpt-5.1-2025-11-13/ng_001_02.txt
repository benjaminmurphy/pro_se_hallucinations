COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  
__________________________________________________________  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Whole Foods”), and alleges as follows:

                           I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Whole Foods Market, Inc. is a foreign corporation authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, operating grocery retail stores open to the public, including a store located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the premises known as Whole Foods Market, located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143 (the “Premises”).

                     II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is a civil tort action for personal injuries arising out of an incident that occurred in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, and related provisions governing the jurisdiction of the District Court Department, because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and related venue statutes because the cause of action arose in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the Defendant transacts business and maintains the Premises within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

                            III. FACTS

7. On or about September 16, 2023, a Saturday afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a customer and business invitee, shopping at the Whole Foods Market located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA 02143.

8. As a paying customer and invitee, Plaintiff was on the Premises for a purpose directly connected with Defendant’s business, and Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care to keep the Premises in a reasonably safe condition. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing common-law distinctions and recognizing duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors).

9. While walking in the dairy aisle of the store, Plaintiff suddenly and without warning stepped into a puddle of spilled milk on the floor.

10. The puddle of milk was not small; it was of sufficient size that shopping cart tracks were visibly running through it, indicating that customers and/or carts had passed through the puddle before Plaintiff’s fall.

11. There were no “Wet Floor” signs, cones, caution tape, or other warning devices in or near the area of the spill.

12. There were no barrier, closure, or redirection measures in place to keep customers away from the spill, and customers were allowed to walk through the dairy aisle where the hazard existed.

13. At the time of the incident, a Whole Foods employee was stocking shelves approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the puddle of milk.

14. After Plaintiff fell, the employee approached Plaintiff and stated, in substance, that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing what he was doing before going to get a mop or to clean it up.

15. The employee’s statement indicates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual notice of the dangerous condition (the spilled milk) for a period of time before Plaintiff’s fall and failed to take reasonable steps to clean it up or warn customers.

16. Alternatively, the visible cart tracks through the spilled milk and the presence of the employee nearby support a finding of constructive notice, in that the condition existed for a sufficient period that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care and proper inspections, should have discovered and remedied or warned of it. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

17. As Plaintiff stepped into the puddle of milk, her foot slipped out from under her due to the slick, wet surface, and she fell forcefully to the floor, landing on her hip.

18. Plaintiff experienced immediate pain in her hip but, believing initially that the injury might be minor, completed her shopping and left the store.

19. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s hip pain significantly increased, and she experienced difficulty walking and performing normal activities.

20. On the following day, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility, where she was evaluated and diagnosed with a hip sprain.

21. Plaintiff followed medical advice and subsequently underwent a course of physical therapy to treat her hip injury.

22. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) for urgent care, follow-up care, and physical therapy.

23. As a direct and proximate result of her injuries and pain, Plaintiff missed multiple work shifts at her café job, causing her to lose approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) in wages.

24. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities, all as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

25. Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses were caused by the negligence of Defendant, its agents, servants, and/or employees in failing to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition, and in failing to timely clean up, inspect for, or warn of the spilled milk.

26. At all relevant times, Defendant’s employees were acting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency with Defendant, making Defendant vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317 (2002).

27. Plaintiff did not create the dangerous condition, had no knowledge of it, and had no reasonable opportunity to avoid it.

28. Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety while walking in the dairy aisle in the ordinary manner in which a customer would shop.

29. Any comparative negligence on the part of Plaintiff, which is expressly denied, is less than any negligence attributable to Defendant, and in any event is governed by the comparative negligence principles set forth in G.L. c. 231, § 85 and cases applying it, including Zeller v. Cantu, 395 Mass. 76 (1985).

                      IV. CAUSE OF ACTION
                            NEGLIGENCE

30. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–29 as if fully set forth herein.

Duty

31. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful business invitee on its Premises, a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the Premises, including aisles and walking surfaces, in a reasonably safe condition and to protect Plaintiff against unreasonable risks of harm that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (adopted in part in Massachusetts).

32. Defendant also owed a duty to conduct reasonable inspections of the store, including the dairy aisle, to discover hazardous conditions such as spills and to either remedy those conditions or provide adequate warnings to customers. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007) (discussing reasonable measures to prevent slip-and-fall injuries in a supermarket).

Breach

33. Defendant, by and through its employees, breached its duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk on the floor of the dairy aisle after becoming aware of it;

   b. Failing to place cones, signs, or other warning devices to alert customers to the presence of the hazard;

   c. Allowing customers to continue to pass through the area despite knowledge of the spill;

   d. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable inspection and maintenance procedures to identify and remedy spills and other hazards in a timely fashion;

   e. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees regarding timely response to known spills; and

   f. Failing to otherwise maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition.

34. The employee’s admission that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” before Plaintiff fell demonstrates actual knowledge of the dangerous condition and a failure to take reasonable, timely action. See, e.g., Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (liability where defendant has actual notice and fails to act reasonably).

35. Even if Defendant lacked actual knowledge, the visible cart tracks and the location of the spill in a busy dairy aisle show that the condition existed long enough that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care and inspection procedures, should have discovered and corrected it, and thus had constructive notice. See Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263 (1961) (constructive notice from condition’s duration); Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc., 332 Mass. 560 (1955).

Causation

36. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as described above, were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (defining proximate cause and foreseeability).

37. The type of accident that occurred—a customer slipping on spilled liquid in a supermarket aisle—is a foreseeable consequence of failing to timely clean up or warn of such spills, and is within the scope of the risk created by Defendant’s negligence. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996).

Damages

38. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a hip sprain, resulting in pain, suffering, and loss of normal function.

39. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) for evaluation, treatment, and physical therapy.

40. Plaintiff suffered lost wages of approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) due to missed work shifts while she was recovering from her injuries.

41. Plaintiff has endured and continues to endure physical pain and discomfort, mental and emotional distress, inconvenience, and a loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the fall and injuries. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in actions for personal injuries).

42. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all past and future special damages (including medical expenses and lost earnings) and general damages (including pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life) proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence. See doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776 (1975) (damages principles); Santos v. Chrysler Corp., 430 Mass. 198 (1999).

Comparative Negligence

43. To the extent Defendant alleges negligence on the part of Plaintiff, such negligence is denied. However, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, any such alleged negligence on Plaintiff’s part, if found by the trier of fact, does not bar recovery unless it is greater than the total negligence of the Defendant, and any damages shall be diminished in proportion to any negligence attributable to Plaintiff. See Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50 (1988).

44. Defendant bears the burden of proving any comparative negligence defenses under G.L. c. 231, § 85 and related Massachusetts cases.

                             V. RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Whole Foods Market, Inc., and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be within the jurisdiction of the Somerville District Court, including:

   1. Medical expenses, past and future, currently estimated at approximately $2,000.00, subject to proof at trial;

   2. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity, past and future, currently estimated at approximately $1,500.00 in past lost wages, subject to proof at trial;

   3. Pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact;

B. Prejudgment interest at the rate provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B from the date of commencement of this action, and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Costs of this action as allowed by G.L. c. 261 and applicable rules;

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                        VI. JURY DEMAND

Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60 and the applicable Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
