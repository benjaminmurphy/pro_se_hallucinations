      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely explains that, in Massachusetts negligence actions, comparative negligence under G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 85 applies such that a plaintiff\u2019s fault bars recovery only if it exceeds 50%, and otherwise merely reduces damages. The court explicitly rejects importing the \u2018unreasonable use\u2019 bar from warranty into negligence because that would conflict with the comparative negligence statute, and notes that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct is to be weighed and can bar recovery only if more than fifty percent responsible. This directly supports a pleading that any comparative negligence less than 51% still allows recovery subject to reduction.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In a negligence case, the conduct of the plaintiff which will serve to bar recovery is governed by statute. Our comparative negligence statute provides that the plaintiff's contributory negligence shall not bar recovery if the plaintiff's negligence was not greater than the total amount of negligence attributable to the parties against whom recovery is sought. The plaintiff's negligence, if less than the amount attributable to the defendant or defendants, only serves to diminish recovery by the proportion of negligence attributable to the plaintiff. G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 85 (1986 ed.). \u2026 The plaintiff's conduct \u2026 does not bar recovery completely unless the plaintiff is more than fifty per cent responsible for his or her own injuries."
