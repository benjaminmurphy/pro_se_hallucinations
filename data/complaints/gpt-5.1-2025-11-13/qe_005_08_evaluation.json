It treats the covenant as a background obligation of the landlord under Massachusetts law and applies it to prohibit the landlord\u2019s interference (via operation and control of the lounge) with the tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment of their apartments. This aligns with the proposition that Massachusetts law implies such a covenant into every residential tenancy, independent of express lease terms.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The judge found that the tenants were \"very substantially deprived\" of quiet enjoyment of their leased premises \"for a substantial time\" (emphasis original). He ruled that the tenants\u2019 implied warranty of quiet enjoyment was violated by late evening and early morning music and disturbances coming from nearby premises which the landlords leased to others for use as a bar or cocktail lounge (lounge)\u2026 Our opinions concerning a constructive eviction by an alleged breach of an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment\u2026 Although some of our opinions have spoken of particular action or inaction by a landlord as showing a presumed intention to evict, the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling."

That framework supports the proposition that a landlord\u2019s inaction and dismissive response, in the face of continuous and foreseeable interference by someone under the landlord\u2019s control, can constitute an unreasonable and substantial interference with quiet enjoyment, though the facts here involve lead paint rather than another tenant.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We have also said that \u00a7 14 imposes liability whenever the \" 'natural and probable consequence' of a landlord's action was interruption of the tenant's rights.\" Simon v. Solomon, supra at 102, quoting Westland Hous. Corp. v. Scott, 312 Mass. 375, 381 (1942). In Cruz, we observed that the landlord had notice of the defects in the leased premises which it failed to repair, and that it was \"wholly foreseeable\" that the injury to the tenant would result from this failure to make the repairs. Indeed, in each case since the 1973 statutory revision in which we have recognized a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, there was evidence that the landlord failed to act reasonably in the circumstances concerning a problem known to the landlord, and the natural and probable consequences of such failure caused the interference with the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the premises."

It does not address excessive noise, threats, or other disturbances affecting sleep or peace in the home, so it cannot be cited as authority for that broader proposition about \u201csubstantial and chronic disturbances\u201d generally. The case is good authority for heat-related deprivations as a breach, not for noise or threat-based disturbances.",

Wideman is focused on the proper *measure of damages* for breach of the implied warranty of habitability in a Section 8 tenancy, not on the legal standard for or characterization of interference with quiet enjoyment. The court even notes that although the trial judge found a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, no damages were awarded on that claim to avoid duplication, and the opinion does not analyze whether the interference was substantial, repetitive, or affected sleep/rest or habitability in the way the proposition states. Thus, it provides factual background of serious conditions but does not establish the specific legal proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Wideman\u2019s tenancy with Cruz Management commenced on or about May 18, 1988. She vacated her apartment, located at 228 Magnolia Street, in the Dorchester section of Boston, some time in October, 1990. During her tenancy, she and her two sons endured continuing infestations of rodents and cockroaches. Heat in the apartment ranged from nonexistent (at worst) to insufficient (at best). Cruz Management had notice of these defects, as well as others, which the judge found existed... Most of the violations remained uncorrected through October, 1990, when Wideman finally vacated."
