JAKE WILLIAMS,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  


COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)


Plaintiff Jake Williams (“Plaintiff”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Johnson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jake Williams (“Williams”) is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mark Johnson (“Johnson”) is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was operating a motor vehicle in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, thereby placing this matter within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, in that the cause of action arose in Suffolk County, at or near 500 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about September 10, 2023, at approximately [time unknown], Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bicycle lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts, in the vicinity of 500 Commonwealth Avenue.

7. Commonwealth Avenue in that area is a busy public way within the meaning of G.L. c. 89 and G.L. c. 90, regularly used by motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians.

8. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating his bicycle in a reasonable, prudent, and lawful manner, within the designated bike lane, obeying applicable traffic control devices and rules of the road, and wearing a bicycle helmet.

9. At or near the same time and location, Defendant was operating and/or in control of a motor vehicle used in connection with rideshare services and was parked or stopped in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bicycle lane.

10. The loading zone where Defendant stopped or parked his vehicle was directly next to the bicycle lane, such that any opening of the driver’s side door would extend into, or very near, the path of travel of cyclists within the bike lane.

11. While Plaintiff was proceeding straight ahead within the marked bicycle lane, Defendant, without first checking his side mirror, looking over his shoulder, or otherwise ascertaining whether it was safe to do so, suddenly and forcefully opened the driver’s side door of his vehicle into the bicycle lane.

12. Defendant opened his door into the lane of travel at a time when it was unsafe to do so and when Plaintiff was immediately adjacent to, or nearly adjacent to, the vehicle, leaving Plaintiff no time or space to safely stop, slow, or maneuver around the suddenly opened door.

13. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to avoid a collision with the suddenly opened door, given the speed of traffic, the narrow width of the bike lane, the suddenness of the movement, and his lawful and prudent operation of his bicycle.

14. Plaintiff’s bicycle struck the edge of the suddenly opened driver’s side door, causing Plaintiff to be thrown from his bicycle and to impact the pavement.

15. As a direct and proximate result of the collision, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries including but not limited to road rash abrasions on his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth.

16. The force of the impact also bent and damaged Plaintiff’s bicycle frame, rendering the bicycle unsafe and uneconomical to repair, and necessitating the purchase of a replacement bicycle.

17. At the scene of the incident, Defendant admitted that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone at or about the time he opened the door.

18. Defendant’s admission that he was “checking his phone” demonstrates that he was distracted and not keeping a proper lookout as required of a reasonably prudent driver, and that he failed to devote his full attention to the safe operation and control of his motor vehicle and its doors.

19. Subsequent to the incident, when Plaintiff submitted a claim to Defendant’s automobile liability insurer, Defendant gave a different version of events, asserting that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

20. Plaintiff was not weaving in and out of traffic. Plaintiff was riding within the marked bicycle lane, in a straight line, in a safe and prudent manner, and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations at all relevant times.

21. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff incurred injuries, physical pain, and emotional distress, including but not limited to pain from his abrasions and tooth injury, fear during and after the crash, and anxiety about the cost of medical and dental treatment and transportation.

22. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff required medical and dental evaluation and treatment, including treatment to address the chipped front tooth and care for road rash injuries.

23. Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses incurred as a result of the incident are approximately $1,200 to date.

24. As a further direct and proximate result of the incident and his resulting injuries, Plaintiff missed work and lost wages in the approximate amount of $600.

25. Plaintiff also incurred property damage in the form of the loss of the use and value of his damaged bicycle, requiring him to purchase a new bicycle at his own expense.

26. Plaintiff has suffered, and may in the future suffer, ongoing discomfort, scarring or discoloration from abrasions, sensitivity or cosmetic issues with his chipped or repaired front tooth, and other sequelae related to the incident.

27. At all times material hereto, Plaintiff acted with due care and in a reasonably prudent manner for his own safety.

28. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligent conduct, nor did he consent to or cause the sudden opening of the vehicle door into his lane of travel.

29. The incident and Plaintiff’s injuries were caused solely or predominantly by Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, as more fully described below.

### IV. DUTIES OWED AND APPLICABLE LAW

30. Under Massachusetts law, every driver of a motor vehicle owes a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances toward all foreseeable users of the road, including bicyclists. *See, e.g.,* **Coombes v. Florio**, 450 Mass. 182, 190 (2007) (duty of reasonable care extends to those foreseeably put at risk by one’s conduct); **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006).

31. A motorist owes a duty to maintain a proper lookout for bicyclists and other traffic, to use reasonable care when stopping or parking near lanes of travel, and to avoid creating sudden hazards in areas where bicyclists are known or likely to be. *See, e.g.,* **Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902–03 (1987) (reasonable care in light of foreseeable risks).

32. Defendant also had a specific statutory duty under G.L. c. 90, § 14, which provides in relevant part that “[n]o person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists.” Violation of a safety statute is evidence of negligence. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990); **St. Germaine v. Pendergast**, 411 Mass. 615, 620–21 (1992).

33. G.L. c. 85, § 11B recognizes bicycles as vehicles and grants bicyclists the right to use public ways and to ride in bicycle lanes, subject to the same basic rules of the road as drivers of motor vehicles. Bicyclists are among the class of persons the legislature sought to protect by enacting G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related motor vehicle safety provisions.

34. Under Massachusetts common law, negligence consists of a duty of reasonable care, a breach of that duty, causation, and damages. *See* **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. at 146; **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

35. Foreseeability of harm is an essential component of duty and proximate cause; one who creates a foreseeable risk of injury to another through careless conduct may be held liable for the resulting harm. *See* **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.**, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978); **Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37, 44–45 (2009).

36. Under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s contributory negligence, if any, does not bar recovery so long as it is not greater than the negligence of Defendant, and any damages are diminished in proportion to any causal negligence attributable to Plaintiff.

37. The question of negligence, breach of duty, and comparative fault, if any, is for the trier of fact. *See, e.g.,* **Uloth v. City Tank Corp.**, 376 Mass. 874, 881 (1978); **Thompson v. County of Franklin**, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 974, 975 (1983).

### V. COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

38. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 37 as if fully set forth herein.

39. At all times relevant, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation and control of his vehicle and in the opening of the vehicle door, including, but not limited to:

   a. A duty to comply with G.L. c. 90, § 14 and all other applicable motor vehicle safety statutes and regulations;

   b. A duty to maintain a proper lookout for bicyclists lawfully using the adjacent bike lane and roadway;

   c. A duty to refrain from opening the driver’s side door into the bicycle lane or otherwise into traffic unless and until it was reasonably safe to do so;

   d. A duty to avoid engaging in distracting activities, such as looking at a phone, that would interfere with his ability to observe oncoming bicyclists and traffic before opening his door;

   e. A duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would under the same or similar circumstances, in recognition of the foreseeable risk of harm to bicyclists traveling in the adjacent bike lane.

40. Defendant breached the aforesaid duties of care, including but not limited to in the following respects:

   a. Opening the driver’s side door suddenly and without warning into the marked bicycle lane, directly into Plaintiff’s path of travel, in violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14;

   b. Failing to ascertain that it was reasonably safe to open his door and that doing so would not interfere with the movement of other traffic, including a bicyclist in the adjacent bike lane;

   c. Failing to check his mirrors, look over his shoulder, or otherwise keep a proper lookout before opening the door;

   d. Diverting his attention from the task of safely opening the vehicle door by “checking his phone,” thereby driving and/or exiting his vehicle while distracted;

   e. Failing to appreciate the high likelihood that opening a door into a designated bicycle lane on a busy street without checking for bicyclists would cause a collision and resulting injuries;

   f. Failing to exercise the degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person in like circumstances would have used.

41. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that bicyclists such as Plaintiff commonly use the marked bike lanes on Commonwealth Avenue and that abruptly opening a vehicle door into such a lane without looking created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of serious injury to such bicyclists.

42. Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related safety laws constitutes evidence of negligence and supports an inference that Defendant failed to use reasonable care. *See* **Bennett**, 408 Mass. at 359–60; **St. Germaine**, 411 Mass. at 620–21.

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff collided with the suddenly opened vehicle door, was thrown to the pavement, and sustained physical injuries, including road rash on his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth.

44. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage, including a bent and damaged bicycle frame which was rendered unsafe and/or not reasonably repairable, and related out-of-pocket expenses for a replacement bicycle.

45. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses as a result of the injuries sustained in the incident, in an approximate amount of $1,200, and may incur additional medical or dental expenses in the future.

46. Plaintiff lost approximately $600 in wages due to missed work directly attributable to his injuries and medical/dental appointments stemming from the incident.

47. Plaintiff suffered physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in his activities as a result of his injuries, as well as emotional distress, including but not limited to shock and fear at the time of the collision, anxiety about riding a bicycle after the incident, and concern about his appearance and dental condition due to the chipped front tooth.

48. Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life, including limitations or hesitancy in commuting by bicycle, an activity that previously formed part of his ordinary daily routine and recreation.

49. Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent conduct and violation of his statutory and common-law duties of care to bicyclists.

50. Any negligence on the part of Plaintiff, which is expressly denied, was less than the negligence of Defendant, and in any event, Plaintiff is entitled under G.L. c. 231, § 85 to recover damages diminished only in proportion to any causal negligence attributable to him.

51. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for his bodily injury, pain and suffering, lost wages, medical expenses, and property damage proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence. *See* **McGuiggan v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co.**, 398 Mass. 152, 156–57 (1986); **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540, 547–48 (1982).

### VI. DAMAGES

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages, among others:

   a. Past and future medical and dental expenses, including approximately $1,200 incurred to date;

   b. Past lost wages in the approximate amount of $600, and any future loss of earning capacity as may be proven at trial;

   c. Property damage and related out-of-pocket costs associated with the bent and damaged bicycle frame and the purchase of a replacement bicycle;

   d. Physical pain and suffering, including pain from abrasions, dental injury, and any residual discomfort;

   e. Emotional distress and mental anguish, including fear during the incident, anxiety afterward, and distress related to altered appearance and function of the chipped tooth;

   f. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal daily activities, particularly Plaintiff’s ability to commute and recreate by bicycle safely and confidently;

   g. Any scarring, disfigurement, or permanent cosmetic or functional impairment associated with the injuries;

   h. All other losses and damages to be established at trial.

53. Plaintiff is entitled to recover prejudgment interest on his damages as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

---

### VII. JURY DEMAND

54. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 and applicable law, Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
