COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting-time judgment, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR ORDER

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Jenkins (DOB withheld for privacy), age 8.

2. The Defendant, Mark Jenkins (“Father”), upon information and belief, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, currently living on Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Mother and the child’s school.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6, and G.L. c. 208, § 28 (as applied to custody and parenting-time provisions), and personal jurisdiction over both parties.

4. A Judgment or Order regarding custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child was entered by this Court on or about May 15, 2019 (the “2019 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2019 Judgment, the Mother was granted primary physical custody of the minor child, with the Father having parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays, designed at the time to accommodate both parents’ residences in the same town and a brief commute to the child’s school the following morning.

6. At the time the 2019 Judgment was entered, both parties lived in the same town, and the Wednesday overnight did not require extensive travel. The Wednesday overnight arrangement was premised on the parties’ close geographic proximity and on minimizing disruption to the child’s school schedule and routine.

7. This Court retains continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time matters involving the minor child under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law. See, e.g., *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Guardianship of Estabrook*, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 102 (1986).

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the minor child, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 370–72 (1981) (modification requires material change of circumstances); *Pearson v. Pearson*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 159–60 (2001).

9. After the 2019 Judgment, the Father relocated his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Mother’s residence and from the child’s school.

10. Notwithstanding this relocation and the significantly increased travel distance, the Father has continued to exercise the Wednesday midweek overnight in the same manner contemplated when the parties lived in the same town.

11. On Wednesdays, the Father now picks up the minor child from school, drives her approximately ninety (90) miles to Cape Cod, and then wakes her at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings in order to drive her back to school.

12. As a result of this early-morning travel and the long round-trip car ride on school days, the minor child is frequently overtired, sleep‑deprived, and runs a risk of diminished academic performance and emotional well‑being.

13. The child’s teacher has reported to the Mother that the child’s participation, attention, and engagement in class have noticeably decreased on Thursdays, correlating with the midweek overnight at the Father’s Cape Cod residence and the resulting 4:30 a.m. wake‑ups.

14. The long-distance, midweek travel has caused the minor child to experience significant fatigue and has interfered with her sleep schedule, her ability to concentrate in school, and her general well‑being.

15. The Wednesday overnight arrangement, which was originally reasonable and minimally disruptive when the parties lived in close proximity, has become unreasonably burdensome and detrimental to the child’s welfare due to the Father’s relocation and the lengthy commute.

16. The Father’s move and the resulting impact on the child’s school days constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances that was not contemplated by the Court at the time of the 2019 Judgment. See *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 681–82 (2016) (relocation and resulting effects may constitute material change warranting modification); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262–63 (2001).

17. The current midweek schedule no longer serves the minor child’s best interests and is contrary to the public policy of promoting a stable, healthy, and predictable environment for children of separated parents. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985) (best interests of the child are paramount); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003).

18. The Mother is not seeking to terminate or unduly restrict the Father’s relationship with the child, but rather to modify the schedule in a manner that protects the child’s sleep, school attendance, academic performance, and general welfare, while preserving meaningful parenting time.

19. Any modification requested herein is tailored to address the specific material change arising from the Father’s relocation and the resulting extreme midweek commute, and is consistent with the child’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

### III. APPLICABLE LAW

20. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing judgment regarding custody and parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.

21. The best interests of the child standard governs all decisions relating to custody and parenting time. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

22. Massachusetts courts have held that relocation or a significant change in the structure, logistics, or feasibility of a parenting-time schedule can constitute a material change in circumstances requiring modification. See *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

23. Where, as here, the existing parenting schedule has become detrimental to a child’s academic performance, sleep, and daily routine, the Court has the authority and responsibility to modify the schedule to conform to the child’s best interests. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (modifications appropriate where circumstances adversely affect child); *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 681–82.

24. The Court is empowered to adjust midweek overnights, transportation responsibilities, and weekend schedules to minimize disruption to the child’s schooling and well‑being, so long as both parents retain the opportunity for a continuing relationship with their child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

25. The minor child is school‑aged, and her academic progress, school attendance, and daily functioning are central components of her best interests under Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998).

26. The current schedule requires that the child spend late Wednesday afternoons and evenings traveling a long distance, only to be awakened at approximately 4:30 a.m. to travel back to school on Thursday mornings. This is inherently exhausting and does not promote the child’s health, education, or emotional security.

27. The teacher’s reported concerns—that the child’s participation and engagement in class have noticeably declined on Thursdays—are consistent with the Mother’s observations that the child is tired, irritable, and less able to focus on school work on those days.

28. Maintaining the existing Wednesday overnight arrangement would continue to subject the child to repeated, foreseeable hardships on school days, undermining her academic and emotional stability, contrary to her best interests.

29. Eliminating the midweek overnight and restructuring the Father’s parenting time to avoid lengthy school‑night travel would reasonably accommodate the Father’s relationship with the child while prioritizing the child’s sleep, schooling, and overall welfare.

30. A revised schedule that maintains regular and meaningful weekend parenting time for the Father, while removing the midweek overnight that requires 4:30 a.m. wake‑ups and two lengthy commutes on a school day, is in the child’s best interests and consistent with Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

31. The Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 Judgment—specifically, the Father’s relocation to Cape Cod, the resulting 90‑mile commute, and the negative impact of the Wednesday overnight on the child’s rest and school performance—and that modification is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the child.

32. The Mother respectfully requests that the Court eliminate the Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time during the school year, and instead provide for:

   a. No midweek overnight on school nights requiring travel between Cape Cod and the child’s school;  

   b. The Father’s parenting time to consist of alternating weekends from Friday after school (or at a reasonable hour on Friday) through Sunday at a reasonable hour, with appropriate transportation arrangements; and  

   c. Such additional or alternative weekend and/or vacation parenting time as the Court deems appropriate to maintain a meaningful relationship between the Father and the child, without requiring extreme early‑morning travel on school days.

33. The Mother further requests that any holiday, vacation, and summer schedule in the 2019 Judgment be adjusted, if necessary, solely to conform to the elimination of the Wednesday school‑night overnight and to ensure that any long-distance travel occurs on non‑school days to the extent reasonably possible.

34. The Mother does not seek to interfere with or diminish the Father’s parental rights beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect the child’s best interests, health, and education, and requests only those modifications necessary to address the material changes in circumstances described above.

35. The requested relief is narrowly tailored to prevent unnecessary disruption to the child’s education and sleep, while preserving the Father’s opportunity for regular and meaningful parenting time.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and determine that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2019 Judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28, due to the Father’s relocation and the resulting detrimental impact of the midweek Wednesday overnight on the child’s sleep and schooling;

B. Modify the 2019 Judgment to eliminate the Father’s Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time during the school year, and to provide instead for an adjusted schedule of parenting time that does not require the minor child to wake at approximately 4:30 a.m. and travel ninety (90) miles to school on Thursday mornings;

C. Establish a revised parenting-time schedule granting the Father regular, meaningful parenting time primarily on weekends, holidays, vacations, and other non‑school days, so as to minimize disruption to the child’s schooling and daily routine, specifically including alternating weekends from Friday after school through Sunday, or such other schedule as the Court finds to be in the child’s best interests;

D. Order such ancillary or clarifying provisions as may be necessary concerning transportation, pick‑up and drop‑off times and locations, and allocation of driving responsibilities, to effectuate the modified parenting plan and minimize disruption to the child;

E. Incorporate into the modified judgment any additional terms the Court deems just and proper to promote the minor child’s best interests, health, safety, education, and emotional well‑being; and

F. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
