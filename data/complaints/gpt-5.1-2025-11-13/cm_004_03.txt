COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins (“Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Tom Collins (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Tom Collins, is an individual believed to reside in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - Max Collins, age 8 (“the minor child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, 31, and 31A, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this is a Complaint for Modification of an existing Probate and Family Court custody and parenting-time order concerning a minor child domiciled in the Commonwealth.

5. On or about November 15, 2019, the Bristol County Probate and Family Court entered a judgment and/or order (the “2019 Order”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child.

6. Under the 2019 Order, Mother has primary physical custody of the minor child, and Father was granted three short visits during the week plus one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.

7. The 2019 Order was based, in substantial part, on Father’s then‑limited and unsuitable housing situation; specifically, Father had only a room in a shared apartment with roommates and had no separate, appropriate sleeping space for the minor child.

### III. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

8. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may modify a judgment as to custody or parenting time “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the child’s best interests. See also Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).

9. Massachusetts law provides that in making custody and parenting-time determinations, “the rights of the parents shall, in the absence of misconduct, be held to be equal, and the happiness and welfare of the children shall determine their custody.” G.L. c. 208, § 31; Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

10. To warrant modification of a custody or parenting-time judgment, the moving party must show (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 293–294 (2009); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 546–548 (2010); Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 150–151 (2015).

11. In assessing best interests, the Court considers, among other factors, the child’s age and developmental needs, the child’s relationship with each parent, the stability and suitability of each parent’s home, and the child’s schooling and routines. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

12. A substantial improvement or change in a parent’s housing and living arrangements may constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances justifying modification of parenting time. See Custody of Michel, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 267–268 (1990) (changed conditions and improved environment can warrant modification); Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 150–151.

13. The Court also recognizes the importance of a stable, developmentally appropriate parenting schedule and maintaining and strengthening the relationship between a child and both parents, where consistent with the child’s welfare. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

14. Since entry of the 2019 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances relating to both the minor child and Father’s living situation.

15. At the time of the 2019 Order, the minor child was three years old, not yet a full‑time school‑age child, and the Court fashioned a schedule appropriate for a toddler and in light of Father’s then‑inadequate housing.

16. The minor child is now eight years old and in full‑time school. His developmental needs, school schedule, extracurricular activities, and need for consistent routines—including homework, bedtime, and rest—are significantly different from when he was three.

17. The current parenting-time arrangement of three short visits during the week plus a Sunday afternoon, with no overnights, results in the minor child being shuttled frequently back and forth between the parents’ homes on school nights for brief visits.

18. The frequent, short visits on school nights are exhausting for the minor child and make it difficult to establish consistent routines for homework, dinner, and bedtime, thereby interfering with his rest, focus, and overall well‑being.

19. The frequent transitions are also burdensome for both parents, complicating coordination of school schedules, transportation, and the minor child’s activities.

20. Since the 2019 Order, Father’s housing situation has substantially and materially improved. He now has his own apartment rather than a single room in a shared apartment with roommates.

21. In Father’s current apartment, the minor child has his own bedroom and a suitable, stable, and private sleeping arrangement, which did not exist at the time of the 2019 Order.

22. The primary reason that the 2019 Order did not provide overnight parenting time to Father was that his housing at that time was not conducive to overnight stays and did not provide an appropriate separate sleeping arrangement for the minor child.

23. The concern that underpinned the restriction on overnights in the 2019 Order—Father’s lack of appropriate space—has been resolved by Father’s acquisition of an independent apartment and a separate bedroom for the minor child.

24. The minor child, now older and more independent, has repeatedly expressed a desire to spend extended time, including overnight visits, with Father.

25. Both Mother and Father recognize that the existing schedule, designed for a three‑year‑old in the context of Father’s former housing, no longer serves the minor child’s best interests as an eight‑year‑old school‑age child.

26. Both Mother and Father agree that the current parenting schedule should be modified to reflect the minor child’s age, schooling, and the improvement in Father’s living circumstances.

27. The changes in the minor child’s age and developmental stage, his full‑time school schedule, the negative impact of frequent short visits on school nights, Father’s significantly improved housing, and the child’s desire for overnights with Father collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2019 Order within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286 (2009); Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); and Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

28. It is in the best interests of the minor child that the parenting‑time schedule be modified to provide for regular, predictable overnight parenting time with Father and to reduce the number of brief, disruptive school‑night transitions.

29. A revised parenting schedule that consolidates Father’s time into longer blocks, including weekends and/or designated overnights, will better support the minor child’s academic, emotional, and social development by ensuring more stable routines for homework, sleep, and activities, and by allowing the minor child to experience more normal, day‑to‑day life in each parent’s home.

30. Father’s present living situation, including his own apartment and a dedicated bedroom for the minor child, provides a suitable and appropriate environment for overnight parenting time.

31. Overnight parenting time will strengthen the father‑child relationship by allowing the minor child to share morning and evening routines with Father, fostering continuity, security, and a deeper bond, consistent with the principles recognized in G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); and Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

32. The modification requested by Mother is not sought to interfere with Father’s relationship with the minor child; rather, Mother seeks an order that better aligns with current realities and affirmatively enhances the minor child’s relationship with both parents in a developmentally appropriate manner.

33. Mother remains the child’s primary physical custodian and seeks to maintain that status, while modifying the schedule of parenting time to include overnights with Father and to adjust the day‑to‑day structure in a way that promotes the minor child’s welfare.

34. The requested modification is consistent with the statutory directive that the Court “shall consider the welfare of the children as paramount,” see G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–843, and is tailored to address the specific material changes in circumstances described above.

35. There are no known issues of abuse, neglect, or misconduct by either parent that would counsel against expanded and more age‑appropriate parenting time with Father. This Complaint is based solely on the material change in circumstances relating to the child’s age and schooling and Father’s improved housing, and on what is in the child’s best interests.

36. Under the totality of the circumstances, and in light of the legal standards set out in G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31 and the cases including Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286 (2009); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); and Custody of Michel, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 260 (1990), the existing 2019 Order should be modified.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

37. Mother respectfully requests that the Court enter a modified judgment and/or order that:

   a. Confirms that Mother shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor child, and that the parties shall share legal custody or otherwise maintain existing legal‑custody arrangements, unless the Court determines that an adjustment is necessary to serve the child’s best interests.

   b. Replaces Father’s current schedule of three short weekday visits and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights, with a more developmentally appropriate parenting‑time plan that includes regular, predictable overnight parenting time with Father in his current apartment where the minor child has his own bedroom.

   c. Reduces or eliminates frequent, brief school‑night transitions in favor of longer, less disruptive blocks of parenting time (for example, weekend overnights or agreed‑upon weekday overnights that minimize interruption to the minor child’s school schedule, homework, and sleep), in such specific configuration as the Court deems to be in the minor child’s best interests.

   d. Orders that the parties continue to communicate cooperatively regarding the minor child’s schooling, homework, medical needs, and activities, and to coordinate exchanges in a manner that minimizes stress and disruption for the minor child.

   e. Provides such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper in the circumstances, consistent with the minor child’s best interests.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the November 15, 2019 custody and parenting‑time order within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28;

2. Determine that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time order is in the best interests of the minor child;

3. Enter a modified judgment and/or order consistent with the requests set forth in Section VI above, including appropriate overnight parenting time with Father and a reduction in frequent short school‑night visits; and

4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
