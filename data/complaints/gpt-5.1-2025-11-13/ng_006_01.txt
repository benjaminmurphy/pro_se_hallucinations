JASON MILLER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                     CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

RIDESHARE SOLUTIONS, INC.,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)  
------------------------------------------------------  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Jason Miller (“Plaintiff” or “Mr. Miller”) is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. He may be contacted for purposes of this action at telephone number (617) 555‑0123 and email address psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Rideshare Solutions, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Rideshare Solutions”) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of a state other than Massachusetts, with its principal place of business outside Massachusetts, that at all relevant times was duly authorized to transact and was transacting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including Suffolk County, by operating, managing, and/or controlling a rideshare transportation network and drivers providing transportation services to the public for compensation.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant, directly or through its agents, servants, employees, or ostensible agents, including the driver involved in the collision described below, was engaged in the business of providing rideshare transportation services in Boston, Massachusetts, including near 418 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.

4. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 when accounting for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and other consequential and general damages, and because this is a civil action in which the plaintiff seeks legal and equitable relief.

5. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper in Massachusetts pursuant to G.L. c. 223A, § 3, because, among other things, Defendant regularly transacts business, contracts to supply services, and derives substantial revenue from goods and services used or consumed in the Commonwealth, and Plaintiff’s claims arise from Defendant’s activities in Massachusetts, including the operation and management of a rideshare driver who, in the course and scope of providing rideshare services, caused injury to Plaintiff in Boston.

6. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 8 and G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the events giving rise to this action occurred within Suffolk County—specifically at or near 418 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215—and Plaintiff resides in Suffolk County.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant’s driver was operating, parking, and/or loading/unloading a motor vehicle in Boston, Massachusetts in connection with the provision of rideshare services arranged through Defendant’s transportation network system, subjecting Defendant and its driver to the duties imposed by Massachusetts common law and statutes, including but not limited to G.L. c. 90 and G.L. c. 231.

GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

8. On or about September 10, 2023, at approximately [time unknown], Plaintiff was riding his bicycle to work in Boston in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue, a busy public roadway with dedicated bicycle infrastructure.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully operating his bicycle within the marked bike lane adjacent to the travel lanes on Commonwealth Avenue, traveling in the same direction as traffic, obeying all traffic control devices and applicable laws, and exercising reasonable care for his own safety.

10. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was wearing a properly‑fitted bicycle helmet and was riding at a safe speed appropriate for the road and traffic conditions.

11. On September 10, 2023, at or near 418 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, a rideshare driver operating under the auspices and authority of Defendant Rideshare Solutions was parked or standing a vehicle in a loading zone directly adjacent to the marked bike lane in which Plaintiff was traveling.

12. The loading zone in which the driver’s vehicle was situated was immediately next to the bike lane, such that the opening of the driver’s side door intruded into and obstructed the space reserved for cyclists.

13. Without first checking his mirrors, looking over his shoulder, or otherwise ascertaining whether the movement could be made safely, the rideshare driver suddenly and forcefully swung the driver’s side door open into the bike lane at the precise moment Plaintiff was passing alongside the vehicle.

14. The rideshare driver failed to keep a proper lookout for persons lawfully traveling in the bike lane, including Plaintiff, and failed to yield the right of way to Plaintiff before opening his door into the bike lane.

15. The abrupt and un-signaled opening of the driver’s door directly into the bike lane constituted a dangerous “dooring” maneuver that created an immediate and unavoidable hazard to Plaintiff.

16. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to stop, slow, or safely maneuver to avoid colliding with the suddenly‑opened door, given the short distance, the speed at which he was traveling, the location of surrounding traffic, and the abruptness with which the door was opened.

17. Plaintiff’s bicycle struck the edge of the open driver’s side door, causing Plaintiff to be thrown from his bicycle and to impact the pavement on Commonwealth Avenue with substantial force.

18. As a result of the collision and the fall, Plaintiff sustained road rash abrasions to his arms and legs, chipped his front tooth, and suffered other personal injuries, as well as damage to his bicycle frame.

19. Immediately following the incident, at the scene, the rideshare driver admitted to Plaintiff, in substance, that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone at or near the time he opened the door.

20. The driver’s admission that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff due to his inattention and use of his phone is an admission of fault and evidence that the driver failed to maintain proper lookout and attention as required by law.

21. Subsequently, when Plaintiff made a claim to the driver’s insurance carrier, the driver falsely asserted that Plaintiff had been “weaving in and out of traffic” prior to the collision.

22. Plaintiff was not weaving in and out of traffic; he was operating his bicycle in a straight line within the marked bike lane and was complying with all applicable traffic laws and exercising due care.

23. The driver’s later, self‑serving account is inconsistent with his contemporaneous admission at the scene and is contradicted by Plaintiff’s lawful behavior and the objectively hazardous nature of the dooring maneuver.

24. The collision and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries were directly and proximately caused by the rideshare driver’s negligent failure to observe the presence of Plaintiff and his failure to ensure that it was safe to open the vehicle door into the bike lane.

25. As a direct result of the incident, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer from physical pain, discomfort, and scarring related to road rash abrasions on his arms and legs.

26. As a further direct result, Plaintiff sustained damage to his front tooth, necessitating dental treatment, including, upon information and belief, restorative work such as bonding or other cosmetic and functional dental procedures.

27. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses as a direct and proximate result of the injuries sustained in the collision.

28. Plaintiff also suffered damage to his bicycle, including a bent and compromised frame, rendering the bicycle unsafe to ride and necessitating its replacement.

29. Plaintiff was required to purchase a new bicycle to resume his usual mode of commuting, incurring reasonable and necessary property damage expenses.

30. As a direct and proximate result of his injuries, medical appointments, and recovery period, Plaintiff was unable to work for certain periods and lost approximately $600 in wages.

31. Plaintiff’s injuries have caused and may continue to cause pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress, for which he is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation.

32. At all relevant times, the rideshare driver was acting as an employee, agent, apparent agent, or statutory agent of Defendant, within the course and scope of his employment or agency relationship with Defendant, and/or while engaged in a trip or activity arranged through Defendant’s rideshare platform for the benefit of Defendant.

33. Defendant had the right to control, and in fact exercised control over, material aspects of the rideshare driver’s conduct, including requirements concerning the operation and parking of the vehicle while providing rideshare services, the use of Defendant’s application and platform, and the rules governing pick‑ups and drop‑offs in Boston.

34. Under recognized principles of respondeat superior and Massachusetts law, Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligence of its driver committed within the course and scope of the driver’s work or services on Defendant’s behalf. See, e.g., Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002) (employer liable for employee’s negligence within scope of employment); Wang Labs., Inc. v. Bus. Incentives, Inc., 398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986).

35. To the extent that Defendant held out the driver as its authorized provider of transportation services, Defendant may also be liable under principles of apparent authority and ostensible agency. See Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 431 Mass. 736, 743–44 (2000).

36. Additionally, Massachusetts statutory law governing “transportation network companies” and rideshare‑type operations confirms that transportation provided through such platforms is subject to state regulation and oversight, reflecting a legislative intent that such entities bear responsibility for the safe operation of vehicles providing rideshare services. See, e.g., G.L. c. 159A½.

37. At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff acted with due care for his own safety and complied with applicable Massachusetts traffic laws and regulations governing bicycle operation, including but not limited to G.L. c. 85, § 11B, which affords bicyclists the right to use public ways and grants them the rights and responsibilities of drivers of vehicles, subject to enumerated exceptions.

38. Under Massachusetts law, motorists and persons opening doors of motor vehicles owe a duty to exercise reasonable care with respect to bicyclists lawfully using the public ways, and may be held liable for “dooring” incidents where they open a vehicle door into the path of a cyclist without first ascertaining that such movement can be made in safety. See G.L. c. 90, § 14 (prohibiting opening a door unless it is reasonably safe to do so and can be done without interfering with the movement of traffic); see also Luz v. Stop & Shop, Inc. of Peabody, 348 Mass. 198, 204 (1964) (duty of reasonable care); Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 51 (1983) (existence of duty is question of law).

39. The collision and injuries described herein were foreseeable consequences of the rideshare driver’s failure to comply with his duty under G.L. c. 90, § 14 and common law to make sure that opening his vehicle door into the adjoining bike lane could be done safely and without interfering with bicycle traffic.

40. Plaintiff’s injuries, including his abrasions, chipped tooth, and damage to his bicycle, were the natural, probable, and foreseeable results of the driver’s failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, and Plaintiff suffered harm of the kind the safety statute and common law duties were designed to prevent. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 359 (1990) (negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages); Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (foreseeability of harm).

41. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of the driver’s negligent conduct, nor did he consent to the hazardous dooring maneuver or to any violation of statutory or common‑law standards of care.

42. To the extent any contributory negligence or comparative fault is alleged, Plaintiff asserts that any such negligence, if any, was less than the causal negligence of Defendant and its driver, and Plaintiff’s recovery is therefore not barred but may at most be diminished in proportion to any fault attributed to him under G.L. c. 231, § 85. See Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 61 (1988) (comparative negligence framework).

43. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to maintaining this action under Massachusetts law, and no further administrative preconditions are required.

COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  
(Against Rideshare Solutions, Inc., on a Vicarious Liability / Respondeat Superior Theory)  

44. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 43 above as if fully set forth herein.

45. Under Massachusetts common law, a defendant is liable in negligence where it owes a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff, breaches that duty, and such breach is both the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff’s damages. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 359 (1990); Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law).

46. At all relevant times, the rideshare driver owed Plaintiff, as a lawful user of the public way and adjacent bike lane, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation, stopping, and exiting of the motor vehicle, including the duty to refrain from opening the vehicle’s door into the path of oncoming bicycle traffic unless and until it was reasonably safe to do so.

47. The rideshare driver’s duty to Plaintiff arose under both common law and statute, including but not limited to G.L. c. 90, § 14 (providing that “[n]o person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic”).

48. The rideshare driver further owed Plaintiff a duty under G.L. c. 85, § 11B, which recognizes bicyclists’ right to use public ways and imposes corresponding obligations on motorists to share the road and respect bicycle lanes, and under G.L. c. 90, § 14 to use due care for bicyclists while driving or otherwise interacting with traffic on a public way.

49. The rideshare driver breached his duty of care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to maintain a proper lookout for cyclists and other lawful users of the roadway and bike lane adjacent to the vehicle;

   b. Opening the driver’s side door of the vehicle suddenly and without warning directly into the marked bike lane, without first ensuring that the movement could be made safely and without interfering with the lawful movement of traffic, including Plaintiff;

   c. Failing to check his mirrors and/or look over his shoulder to ascertain whether a cyclist or other traffic was approaching before opening the door;

   d. Failing to yield the right of way to Plaintiff, who was lawfully traveling in the bike lane;

   e. Using or checking a mobile phone or other electronic device at or near the time of opening the door, thereby diverting his attention from the roadway and adjacent bike lane and contributing to his failure to see Plaintiff;

   f. Parking, stopping, or standing in a manner that created an unreasonable hazard to cyclists in the adjoining bike lane, and then exacerbating that hazard by swinging the door into the lane; and

   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

50. The driver’s act of opening his door into the bike lane without adequately checking for oncoming cyclists was in direct violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14, and such statutory violation is evidence of negligence and, under the circumstances, constitutes negligence. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990) (violation of a safety statute is evidence of negligence); Guinan v. Famous Players‑Lasky Corp., 267 Mass. 501, 516–17 (1929) (violation of statute enacted for protection of travelers may constitute negligence).

51. The risks against which G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related traffic safety statutes are designed to protect include precisely the kind of harm suffered by Plaintiff: collisions between doors and lawful traffic, including bicyclists, caused by the careless opening of vehicle doors into adjacent travel lanes.

52. The rideshare driver’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the collision and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries, and the collision would not have occurred but for that negligence. See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983) (substantial factor causation).

53. The nature of Plaintiff’s injuries and the damage to his bicycle were a foreseeable and natural consequence of the driver’s negligent conduct, and no superseding cause intervened to break the chain of causation. See Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).

54. At all times relevant to the incident, the rideshare driver was acting within the course and scope of his employment, agency, or service relationship with Defendant, by operating a vehicle in connection with rideshare services provided through Defendant’s transportation network platform.

55. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer or principal is liable for the negligent acts of its employees or agents committed within the scope of their employment or agency. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002); Wang Labs., Inc. v. Bus. Incentives, Inc., 398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986).

56. Defendant derived economic benefit from rides provided by the driver and exercised control over the manner and means by which rideshare services were provided, including requiring compliance with Defendant’s policies, terms of service, and applicable laws governing safe operation of vehicles.

57. Accordingly, Defendant is vicariously liable for the rideshare driver’s negligent acts and omissions, including but not limited to his violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related duties of care, under well‑established Massachusetts law of respondeat superior and agency.

58. As a direct and proximate result of the rideshare driver’s negligence, for which Defendant is vicariously liable, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries including road rash abrasions to his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and associated physical pain and suffering.

59. As a further direct and proximate result of the negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses, and he is entitled to recover those amounts as damages. See G.L. c. 231, § 6D (tort actions for personal injuries).

60. As a further direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered property damage to his bicycle, including a bent frame requiring replacement of the bicycle, and is entitled to recover the reasonable costs of repair or replacement. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 85J, 85K (recognizing recovery for property damage in negligence).

61. Plaintiff also lost approximately $600 in wages due to his inability to work for periods necessitated by treatment and recovery, and he is entitled to compensation for such lost earnings as an element of his damages. See Griffin v. Gen. Motors Corp., 380 Mass. 362, 366 (1980) (lost wages recoverable in negligence).

62. Plaintiff has further suffered non‑economic damages, including pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, for which he is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation under Massachusetts law. See doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 787–88 (1975) (allowing recovery for pain and suffering); Conners v. Northeast Hosp. Corp., 439 Mass. 469, 488 (2003).

63. Plaintiff’s total damages, including past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and non‑economic damages, exceed the jurisdictional minimum for this Court and are reasonably anticipated to exceed $50,000.

64. Plaintiff is entitled to recover prejudgment interest on his damages at the statutory rate from the date of commencement of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, as well as post‑judgment interest and costs.

65. To the extent Defendant contends that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff asserts that any such negligence, if any, was less than the causal negligence of Defendant and its driver, and therefore, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s recovery may not be barred but only, at most, diminished in proportion to any percentage of fault assigned to him, and Plaintiff expressly invokes the protection of that statute. See Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 61 (1988).

66. Plaintiff seeks all damages available under Massachusetts law for negligence, including but not limited to compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and any other appropriate consequential and general damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jason Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Rideshare Solutions, Inc., and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be in excess of $50,000, for Plaintiff’s bodily injuries, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non‑economic harms;

B. Compensation for all reasonable and necessary past and future medical, dental, and related expenses incurred as a result of the incident described herein, including but not limited to the approximately $1,500 in medical and dental bills already incurred;

C. Compensation for all lost wages and diminished earning capacity resulting from the incident, including but not limited to the approximately $600 in wages lost to date;

D. Compensation for property damage, including but not limited to the reasonable cost of repair or replacement of Plaintiff’s damaged bicycle and any other personal property damaged in the collision;

E. Prejudgment interest on all damages awarded, computed from the date of commencement of this action, as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and post‑judgment interest as provided by law;

F. Costs of this action, including allowable filing and service fees, as permitted by G.L. c. 261 and applicable rules;

G. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 and Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  

Respectfully submitted,
