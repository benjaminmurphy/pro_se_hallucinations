JASMINE CARTER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Civil Action No. __________  

MICHAEL THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jasmine Carter, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Thompson, alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jasmine Carter (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Carter”), is an individual residing at 123 Ashmont Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

2. Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), upon information and belief, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential rental property located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and the Massachusetts common law of landlord–tenant relations.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s residential tenancy pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law of the Commonwealth.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the Boston Municipal Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, because the leased premises that are the subject of this action are located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 1, 2 & 19.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid monthly rent of approximately $1,800.00 to Defendant for occupancy of the Premises.

9. Plaintiff’s tenancy is a residential tenancy for her personal use and occupancy and not for commercial purposes.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant had a duty, under Massachusetts law and the applicable housing and sanitary codes, to provide Plaintiff with a habitable dwelling, including the provision of adequate and lawful heat during the winter months. See G.L. c. 239, § 8A; G.L. c. 111, § 127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.200, 410.201.

11. Pursuant to 105 C.M.R. 410.201, a Massachusetts landlord is required to maintain a heating system capable of maintaining a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64°F between 11:01 p.m. and 6:59 a.m., during the heating season.

12. During the winter of 2024‑2025 (including, in particular, December 2024 through February 2025), the heating system serving the Premises repeatedly failed to maintain adequate indoor temperatures.

13. On numerous days and evenings during that winter, including but not limited to evenings in December 2024 and January 2025, the indoor temperature in the Premises dropped to approximately 60°F for periods of several hours at a time.

14. These temperature drops commonly occurred in the evenings, when Plaintiff was at home and attempting to use and enjoy the Premises for ordinary residential living.

15. As a result, the Premises were unreasonably cold and uncomfortable for significant periods on repeated occasions throughout the winter heating season.

16. Plaintiff notified Defendant that the heat was not adequately functioning and that the temperature in the Premises was dropping to around 60°F for extended periods.

17. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant sent repair personnel to the Premises on two occasions.

18. On the first occasion, the repair contractor represented that the heat had been “fixed,” and the heating system operated more effectively for approximately one week.

19. After approximately one week, the heating issues recurred, with the temperature again dropping to around 60°F for hours at a time in the evenings.

20. On the second occasion, a different repair person examined the boiler and informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and that there was “not much more to do.”

21. Plaintiff reasonably understood from this statement and Defendant’s subsequent inaction that Defendant did not intend to replace or substantially repair the boiler or otherwise correct the recurring heat problem.

22. Despite knowing that the heating system was not maintaining legally required temperatures, Defendant failed to cure the problem and failed to provide Plaintiff with consistent, adequate heat sufficient to render the Premises habitable and comfortable during the relevant period.

23. Defendant has repeatedly stated or implied to Plaintiff that the heat is “working” because it never went completely out and the building was not “freezing.”

24. Defendant’s position ignores his legal duty to ensure that the heating system maintains the minimum temperatures required by the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.201, and his duty not to interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises. See, e.g., Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994) (quiet enjoyment breaches include substantial interference with tenants’ use of premises).

25. Because Defendant failed to provide adequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and use two electric space heaters in order to keep the Premises livable and to avoid excessively cold indoor conditions.

26. Plaintiff used the space heaters regularly during the winter months when the heat from the building’s system was inadequate, including on many evenings and nights in December 2024 and January 2025.

27. The use of the space heaters significantly increased Plaintiff’s electric utility costs by approximately $150.00 per month during the affected winter months.

28. Plaintiff’s increased utility costs were a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the heating system in good working order and to provide heat in compliance with applicable law.

29. Plaintiff also suffered physical illness related to the cold conditions in the Premises. In or about January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis.

30. Plaintiff’s treating medical provider advised Plaintiff that her bronchitis was likely made worse and/or prolonged by the repeatedly cold indoor air in her apartment.

31. As a result of this bronchitis, Plaintiff missed approximately three (3) days of work and lost wages.

32. Plaintiff also incurred out‑of‑pocket medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics and related medical treatment.

33. Defendant knew or should have known that failure to provide adequate heat could foreseeably cause illness, discomfort, and other damages to tenants, including Plaintiff.

34. The recurring inadequate heat, Plaintiff’s resulting need to use space heaters, the increased electric costs, the physical discomfort, and Plaintiff’s illness and lost wages substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as a habitable residence.

35. Defendant had notice—actual and constructive—of the heating issues and of the effect those issues were having on the Premises and on Plaintiff, yet failed to take effective and timely steps to remedy the conditions.

36. Plaintiff attempted to work with Defendant in good faith, reporting the problem and allowing access for repair attempts, but Defendant failed to ensure that the problem was fully and permanently resolved.

37. At all times relevant, Plaintiff met her obligations as a tenant, including paying rent and allowing reasonable access for repairs.

38. By reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises has been substantially and unreasonably interfered with.

39. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to: increased utility expenses; medical expenses; lost wages; inconvenience; physical discomfort; and loss of the use and enjoyment of her home.

40. Plaintiff estimates her damages to be at least approximately $1,450.00, exclusive of statutory enhancements, attorney’s fees, interest, and costs.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

41. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. Massachusetts law implies in every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14. That statute prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of her rented premises.

43. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from acts or omissions of the landlord that “substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises.” See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284.

44. A landlord’s knowing failure to correct defective conditions that materially affect the habitability of the premises and that the landlord has reason to know will continue to interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

45. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that violations of the State Sanitary Code and housing codes, especially those that affect essential services such as heat, can constitute a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284; Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 402–03 (1982).

46. Essential services such as heat are fundamental components of a habitable dwelling, and a landlord’s failure to provide adequate heat in accordance with applicable law can amount to a breach of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–02 (1979); Hemingway v. Brewer, 363 Mass. 184, 191–93 (1973); see also G.L. c. 239, § 8A.

47. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and related provisions, Defendant was required to provide and maintain a heating system capable of maintaining minimum temperatures of 68°F by day and 64°F by night during the heating season. Defendant’s failure to do so constitutes a serious housing code violation.

48. Defendant knew or should have known that the heating system at the Premises was not maintaining legally required temperatures and that Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises were substantially impaired.

49. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, including his failure to repair or replace the heating system so as to maintain code‑compliant and habitable temperatures, constitute a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

50. Defendant’s repeated insistence that the heat was “working” because it never went completely out, despite actual knowledge of the recurring inadequate temperatures and associated impacts on Plaintiff, demonstrates a willful or at least knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s rights.

51. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was substantial and material. Plaintiff was forced to rely on space heaters, incur significantly higher electric bills, endure uncomfortable and unhealthy cold indoor temperatures, and suffer illness and work absences that were exacerbated by those conditions.

52. Massachusetts courts have held that tenants are entitled to recover damages for such interferences, including multiple damages in appropriate cases under G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as emotional distress and consequential damages. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

53. By failing to correct the chronic heating defect after notice and by continuing to rent the Premises to Plaintiff without providing adequate heat, Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to increased out‑of‑pocket utility costs, medical expenses, lost wages, and loss of the use and enjoyment of her home.

55. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, together with at least three months’ rent or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Although Plaintiff is self‑represented at this time, she reserves the right to seek reasonable attorney’s fees if she later secures counsel.

56. Plaintiff seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but presently estimates her actual damages to be approximately $1,450.00, subject to trebling, plus interest and costs.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jasmine Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Michael Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

   3. Compensation for lost wages resulting from Plaintiff’s illness and inability to work; and

   4. Compensation for the diminution of the value of the rental premises and Plaintiff’s loss of use and enjoyment of her home during the period of inadequate heat.

C. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, an award of no less than three months’ rent or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater, together with interest as allowed by law.

D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs.

E. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, should Plaintiff subsequently retain counsel.

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
