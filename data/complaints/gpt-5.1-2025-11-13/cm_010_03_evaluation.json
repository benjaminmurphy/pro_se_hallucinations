It does not address modification of a parenting or visitation schedule, nor does it discuss the legal standard of a material change in circumstances or the law\u2019s contemplation of updating schedules to reflect current family realities. Therefore, this excerpt does not support the stated proposition.",

To that end, it is often beneficial to the parties, and counsel in advising their clients, to step back and take stock of what the case is about, what has gone on before, and what may lie ahead. In devising the judicial playbook, one should not forget the pocketbook.\""
