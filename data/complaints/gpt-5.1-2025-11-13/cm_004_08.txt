Emily Johnson,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                     Docket No.: ____________  

Michael Smith,  
 Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 215)

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), and complains against the Defendant, Michael Smith (“Father”), and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Liam Smith, age 8.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Liam Smith.

3. This matter concerns custody and parenting time (visitation) with respect to the minor child:

   - Liam Smith, age 8 (date of birth intentionally omitted for privacy).

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to, inter alia, **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6**, and the Court’s general equity powers in domestic relations matters.

5. Venue is proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** because the original custody order was entered here and the child and parties reside in Middlesex County.

6. On or about **March 15, 2018**, this Court entered a Judgment/Order regarding legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor child (the “2018 Custody Order”).

7. Under the 2018 Custody Order, the Mother was granted **primary physical custody** of Liam, and the Father was granted:

   - Three short, non‑overnight visits during the week; and  
   - One Sunday afternoon visit each week;  
   - With **no overnights**, based primarily on the Father’s then‑inadequate housing (a single room in a shared apartment with roommates, without appropriate space for a young child).

8. The Mother brings this **Complaint for Modification** pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and/or **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, to modify the existing custody/parenting time provisions of the 2018 Custody Order based on a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the welfare and best interests of the child.

---

### II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

9. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a Probate and Family Court may modify its prior judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

10. Similarly, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20** authorizes the Court to modify custody and parenting time orders regarding children born to unmarried parents upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the child’s best interests.

11. The “**best interests of the child**” is the paramount and governing standard in child custody and parenting time determinations in Massachusetts. **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 265–266 (2001).

12. To modify an existing custody or parenting time order, the moving party must demonstrate (1) a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is in the **best interests of the child**. **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366, 368–371 (1981); **M.C. v. T.K.**, 463 Mass. 226, 231–232 (2012); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981).

13. Massachusetts law recognizes that changes in a child’s age, developmental needs, schooling, and the parents’ living circumstances may constitute a material change justifying a new parenting schedule. See **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 150–152 (2015) (change in children’s developmental stage and schedules warranted revisiting parenting‑time arrangement); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 844–845 (court must consider child’s changing needs over time).

14. The Court must also consider whether an order will promote stability, predictability, and the child’s overall well‑being, including educational and emotional needs. **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 265–266; **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976).

15. Where both parents are loving and fit, maintaining and fostering a healthy, ongoing relationship with both parents is strongly favored, as long as it serves the child’s best interests. **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 845–846; **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 403–404 (1981) (importance of continued contact with both parents).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

16. **At the time of the 2018 Custody Order**, Liam was approximately three (3) years old, not in full‑time school, and required a high level of daily physical care appropriate to a toddler/preschooler.

17. At that time, the Father lived only in a **single room** within a shared apartment, with multiple roommates and **no dedicated bedroom or suitable space** for the minor child to stay overnight.

18. In light of the Father’s then‑inadequate housing situation, this Court **expressly limited** the Father’s parenting time to short, non‑overnight visits during the week and Sunday afternoons, with **no overnights**, solely as a measure to protect the child’s welfare, comfort, and stability.

19. Since entry of the 2018 Custody Order, there has been a **significant, material, and substantial change in circumstances** affecting Liam’s best interests, including but not limited to the following:

   a. **Liam is now eight (8) years old**, school‑aged, and enrolled in full‑time school, with regular homework, after‑school routines, and age‑appropriate developmental and social needs;  

   b. The Father’s housing has materially improved: the Father now lives in **his own apartment**, not a single room in a shared apartment;  

   c. In the Father’s current apartment, Liam has **his own bedroom**, with appropriate sleeping arrangements and space for his belongings, which did not exist at the time of the 2018 Custody Order;  

   d. The current schedule of **multiple short visits** during the week on school nights, with **no overnights**, requires Liam to be **frequently shuttled back and forth** between homes in short bursts of time;  

   e. This frequent back‑and‑forth on school nights is **disruptive and exhausting** for Liam, and makes it difficult to maintain **consistent homework, dinner, and bedtime routines**;  

   f. Liam has **expressed a desire** to have actual **sleepovers at his father’s residence**, and has asked for the opportunity to spend more continuous time with the Father, including overnight;  

   g. Both parents—Mother and Father—**agree** that the existing, toddler‑oriented schedule is no longer workable for a school‑aged child and needs to be **updated and modified** to fit Liam’s age, school schedule, and practical needs.

20. The combination of (a) Liam’s progression from toddler to school‑aged child, (b) the Father’s **substantial improvement in housing** and ability to provide a safe and appropriate bedroom for Liam, and (c) the **increasing practical and emotional burdens** created by the short‑visit school‑night schedule constitute a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the 2018 Custody Order, within the meaning of **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and relevant case law. See **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. at 370–371; **M.C. v. T.K.**, 463 Mass. at 231–232; **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 150–152.

21. The original rationale for prohibiting overnights—namely, that the Father lacked suitable housing and a dedicated bedroom for the child—**no longer exists**. The Father’s circumstances have improved in ways directly relevant to the safety and comfort of overnight parenting time.

22. The current schedule, designed for a three‑year‑old child with a non‑school‑based routine, has become **misaligned** with Liam’s current developmental stage, school obligations, and desire for more meaningful, less fragmented time with his Father.

23. Courts have recognized that parenting‑time arrangements that once served a child’s best interests may become outdated as the child grows and circumstances change, warranting modification. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 844–845; **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 265–266; **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 710–711 (1985) (discussing the evolution of children’s needs over time).

24. In light of these changed circumstances, continuation of the 2018 Custody Order’s non‑overnight, short‑visit schedule is no longer in Liam’s **best interests**, and modification to allow a more age‑appropriate, overnight‑inclusive schedule is necessary and appropriate.

---

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

25. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, in allocating custody and parenting time, the Court must consider the **best interests of the child**, including, among other factors, the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs, the child’s relationship with each parent, and the capacity of each parent to meet those needs.

26. Both the Mother and Father are actively involved in Liam’s life and, upon information and belief, are able and willing to care for him appropriately during their respective parenting time.

27. There is **no known safety, abuse, or neglect issue** that would prevent Liam from spending extended or overnight time with the Father, and the original concerns related to physical environment and space have been resolved by the Father’s improved housing.

28. The introduction of reasonable, structured **overnight parenting time with the Father** would:

   a. Reduce the excessive and exhausting back‑and‑forth travel associated with multiple brief weekday visits;  

   b. Allow Liam to enjoy **longer, more continuous blocks of time** with his Father, fostering a stronger and more natural parent‑child bond;  

   c. Facilitate more consistent routines for **homework, meals, bedtime, and morning school preparation** in each household;  

   d. Align the parenting schedule with **Liam’s stated wishes** for sleepovers at his Father’s home, consistent with the weight a court may properly give to a mature child’s preferences. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 844–845;  

   e. Support Liam’s emotional and psychological well‑being by recognizing his need for stability in each household while preserving strong, ongoing contact with both parents.

29. The Mother believes, in good faith, that a modified parenting‑time schedule incorporating regular overnights with the Father is in Liam’s **best interests**, provided that transitions and scheduling are tailored around his school obligations and need for rest and routine.

30. Massachusetts appellate decisions emphasize that where both parents are fit and loving, and where circumstances permit, the Court should endeavor to craft parenting‑time arrangements that **promote frequent and continuing contact with both parents**, consistent with the child’s best interests. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 845–846; **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 403–404.

31. The requested modification will **not** alter legal custody (unless otherwise later ordered by the Court), but will simply adjust **physical custody/parenting time logistics** to reflect Liam’s current age, school schedule, and the Father’s improved housing and capacity to care for Liam overnight.

32. By providing a clear, age‑appropriate parenting‑time schedule incorporating overnights, the Court will promote Liam’s **stability, predictability, and overall welfare**, consistent with the guiding principles in **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 265–266, and **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. at 409.

---

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

33. The Mother seeks a modification **only** to the custody/parenting‑time provisions of the 2018 Custody Order, such that the prior limitations on overnights and multiple short weekday visits are replaced with a more suitable schedule that:

   a. Recognizes the Father’s now‑suitable housing and ability to provide Liam with his own bedroom;  

   b. Reduces excessive short‑duration, school‑night exchanges that interfere with homework and sleep; and  

   c. Provides meaningful, consistent overnight parenting time with the Father in a manner appropriate to Liam’s age and schooling.

34. The Mother respectfully requests that the Court enter a **modified judgment** which, at a minimum, includes:

   a. Continuation of the Mother as **primary physical custodian** of Liam (unless and until otherwise ordered);  

   b. Establishment of a **regular schedule of overnight parenting time for the Father**, such as:  

      - At least one or more **weeknight overnights** each week, with appropriate return times to ensure Liam’s timely attendance at school; and/or  
      - **Alternate weekend overnights** (for example, from Friday after school or early evening through Sunday late afternoon or evening), or such other schedule as the Court finds to be in Liam’s best interests;  

   c. Clarification and adjustment of holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time as may be necessary to harmonize with the new overnight schedule, consistent with Liam’s best interests;  

   d. Any additional orders necessary to implement a **stable, age‑appropriate, and school‑compatible** parenting‑time plan that reduces unnecessary travel and respects Liam’s educational and emotional needs.

35. The Mother does **not**, by this Complaint, seek to restrict or interfere with the Father’s relationship with the child; rather, she seeks to **update and rationalize** the parenting‑time schedule to reflect the substantial changes in circumstances and to better serve Liam’s best interests.

36. The requested modification is consistent with **G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the case law cited above, including but not limited to **Schuler v. Schuler**, **M.C. v. T.K.**, **Custody of Kali**, **Rosenthal v. Maney**, **Murray v. Super**, **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, **Rolde v. Rolde**, and **Vilakazi v. Maxie**.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find and rule** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the 2018 Custody Order, within the meaning of **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and applicable case law;

2. **Find and rule** that modification of the existing custody/parenting‑time provisions is in the **best interests of the minor child**, Liam Smith, pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 31**, **G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, and the cases cited herein;

3. **Modify** the 2018 Custody Order to maintain the Mother as **primary physical custodian** (unless otherwise ordered) and to provide the Father with a **revised, age‑appropriate parenting‑time schedule** that includes regular **overnight parenting time**, in a specific pattern (weeknights, weekends, holidays, and vacations) to be determined by the Court as best serving Liam’s welfare;

4. **Order** that the new parenting‑time schedule minimize disruptive, short‑duration exchanges on school nights and support Liam’s **educational, emotional, and physical well‑being**;

5. **Incorporate** such additional provisions as the Court deems proper to effectuate a stable and workable parenting plan for both households;

6. **Award** such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
