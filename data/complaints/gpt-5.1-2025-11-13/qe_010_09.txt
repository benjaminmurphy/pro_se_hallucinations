CIVIL ACTION NO. __________


COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)


Plaintiff Jessica Tran (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Linda Harrison (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Tran is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Linda Harrison, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts who owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851 in which Plaintiff resides.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in a residential tenancy.

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Lowell District Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 & 2, because the Premises are located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2020, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises as her primary residence since June 1, 2020.

8. Plaintiff currently pays rent in the amount of $1,200 per month to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant was the landlord, owner, or person in control of the Premises, and Plaintiff was Defendant’s residential tenant within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

10. The Premises include a bathroom that has no window and is dependent on an exhaust fan for ventilation.

11. In or about 2025, mold began to appear in the bathroom of the Premises, initially in the corner of the shower.

12. Over time, the visible mold spread from the corner of the shower to other portions of the shower area and to the bathroom ceiling.

13. The mold growth has been persistent and recurring, indicating an ongoing moisture, ventilation, or maintenance problem in the bathroom that is beyond normal tenant control.

14. Plaintiff uses the bathroom in a normal, reasonable manner, including taking showers at a customary temperature and duration for an adult person.

15. Plaintiff runs the bathroom exhaust fan during showers and has done so regularly, although not necessarily during every single use, which is consistent with ordinary use by a reasonable tenant.

16. Plaintiff noticed that, after the mold appeared and spread in the bathroom, she began to suffer new and ongoing respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which she had not experienced prior to the development of mold in the Premises.

17. Plaintiff sought medical care for these respiratory symptoms. Her treating doctor informed her that the symptoms are consistent with and likely related to exposure to mold in her living environment and advised that the mold should be removed and remediated.

18. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the presence of mold in the bathroom. Defendant came to the Premises to inspect the mold condition.

19. After viewing the mold, Defendant did not meaningfully investigate or address the underlying cause of the mold and instead blamed Plaintiff, asserting that Plaintiff took showers that were “too hot and too long” and did not run the fan enough.

20. Defendant stated that Plaintiff had “caused” the mold problem and that Defendant would not improve, repair, or modify the ventilation system or otherwise take appropriate remedial steps to correct the underlying conditions that permitted mold growth.

21. Defendant represented that she would only clean the visible mold but would not address the ventilation or any other underlying building or system defects contributing to the mold problem.

22. Despite knowing of the mold condition and its impact on Plaintiff’s health and use of the bathroom, Defendant failed and refused to undertake an adequate remediation consistent with her obligations as a landlord under Massachusetts law and applicable housing and sanitary standards.

23. Mold contamination in the bathroom has rendered the bathroom and, by extension, the Premises partially unfit, unsafe, and unhealthy for normal residential use and occupancy.

24. Plaintiff has been forced to limit her use of the bathroom, to endure unpleasant and unhealthy conditions, and to live with anxiety and concern over ongoing exposure to mold and respiratory illness.

25. Because of the mold contamination, Plaintiff was required to dispose of personal property affected by mold, including a shower curtain and towels, with a replacement value of approximately sixty dollars ($60.00).

26. Plaintiff has also experienced physical discomfort, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, and emotional distress, worry, and loss of peace of mind related to her health and living conditions.

27. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure to properly remedy it violate the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., which requires landlords to maintain rental units in safe, sanitary, and habitable condition, free from chronic dampness and conditions that may contribute to mold growth and respiratory illness. See, e.g., 105 C.M.R. 410.020, 410.300, 410.750.

28. Defendant, as landlord, has a nondelegable duty to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 293 N.E.2d 831 (1973).

29. By failing to abate the mold, to correct the underlying defect or ventilation problem, and to maintain the Premises in a habitable and sanitary condition, Defendant has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

30. The mold condition and Defendant’s inadequate response have directly and foreseeably caused Plaintiff to suffer loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, personal property loss, and physical and emotional harm.

31. Plaintiff estimates that, at a minimum, she has suffered damages of approximately five hundred dollars ($500.00), exclusive of statutory enhancements, fees, and costs, due to the loss of use and enjoyment of her home, her health-related suffering, and property loss, and reserves the right to prove a greater amount at trial.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1–31 as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, both express and implied. G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 358 N.E.2d 817 (1977).

34. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or, in the alternative, for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to “freedom from serious interference with his tenancy—something that impairs the character and value of the leased premises.” Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102, 431 N.E.2d 556 (1982).

36. A landlord’s failure to correct serious code violations, sanitary or health hazards, or conditions materially affecting habitability can constitute an unlawful “interference” with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g.:

   a. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 431 N.E.2d 556 (1982) (repeated flooding and failure to repair constituted breach of quiet enjoyment);

   b. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 506 N.E.2d 1164 (1987) (persistent leaks and unsanitary conditions);

   c. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 629 N.E.2d 248 (1994) (dangerous and unhealthy conditions);

   d. Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 633 N.E.2d 390 (1994) (unsanitary, code-violative conditions as quiet enjoyment violation).

37. The presence of persistent mold, caused or exacerbated by inadequate ventilation or building conditions, is a serious health and habitability concern and constitutes a condition that materially impairs the character and value of a residential apartment. See, e.g., G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

38. Defendant knew or should have known that the mold condition existed in the bathroom and that it posed a danger to Plaintiff’s health and substantially interfered with her use and enjoyment of the Premises.

39. Defendant’s obligation to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and fit for human habitation is a fundamental component of the landlord’s duties and bears directly on the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 293 N.E.2d 831 (1973); See also Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 396 N.E.2d 981 (1979) (landlord liable for failure to maintain premises in habitable condition).

40. Despite notice of the mold condition and Plaintiff’s health complaints, Defendant failed and refused to:

   a. Identify and correct the underlying moisture, ventilation, or structural problems allowing recurrent mold growth;

   b. Ensure the bathroom’s exhaust fan and ventilation were adequate and functioning such that mold would not persist;

   c. Timely and properly remediate the mold in accordance with health, safety, and sanitary standards.

41. Instead, Defendant blamed Plaintiff for the mold condition based on ordinary, reasonable use of the bathroom and refused to upgrade, repair, or replace the ventilation or otherwise adequately remedy the cause of the mold.

42. Defendant’s failure to act to properly remediate the mold and underlying defects, in the face of actual notice and foreseeable harm, constitutes an “indirect” and “substantial” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 358 N.E.2d 817 (1977) (landlord liable for substantial interference when landlord’s conduct set in motion forces causing interference); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

43. Defendant’s interference was not trivial or de minimis. It affected Plaintiff’s health, required Plaintiff to dispose of property, limited her ability to safely use her bathroom, and undermined her sense of security and comfort in her home.

44. The breach of quiet enjoyment may exist regardless of whether the landlord’s conduct is intentional or negligent, so long as the interference is a natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s acts or omissions. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 435 N.E.2d 1237 (1982).

45. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in compliance with applicable codes and sanitary standards, and her refusal to correct the ventilation and mold issues after notice, were at least negligent and were the direct and foreseeable cause of the substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;

   b. Physical discomfort and respiratory symptoms;

   c. Emotional distress, fear, and anxiety related to ongoing mold exposure;

   d. Property loss of approximately $60.00; and

   e. Other consequential damages.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees (to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel or incurs fee obligations).

48. Three months’ rent at Plaintiff’s monthly rent of $1,200 equals $3,600. Plaintiff’s actual damages are currently estimated at no less than $500.00, exclusive of statutory multiples, fees, and costs.

49. Plaintiff elects to seek the greater of (a) actual and consequential damages proven at trial or (b) three months’ rent as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, along with costs and any recoverable attorneys’ fees.
