COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY/CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME)  
-----------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Robinson (“Emily” or “Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order entered by this Court on May 15, 2022, states as follows:

### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable), which empower the Probate and Family Court to modify prior judgments regarding custody and parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where such modification is in the best interests of the minor children.

2. Venue is proper in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the prior Judgment/Order regarding custody and parenting time was entered in this Court on May 15, 2022, and the parties and minor children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 215, § 4; G.L. c. 208, §§ 4, 28.

3. The Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time matters affecting the parties’ minor children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable Massachusetts case law, including Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002).

### II. THE PARTIES AND THE CHILDREN

4. Plaintiff Emily Robinson is an adult individual and the mother of the minor children, residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

5. Defendant David Robinson (“David” or “Defendant”) is an adult individual and the father of the minor children, also residing in or near Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

6. The parties are the parents of the following minor children (“the Children”):

   a. Liam Robinson, age 10; and  
   b. Ava Robinson, age 8.

7. The existing custody and parenting-time order was entered by this Court on or about May 15, 2022 (the “Existing Order”).

### III. PRIOR ORDER

8. Under the Existing Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Children.

9. Under the Existing Order, the Children primarily reside with Plaintiff, with Defendant having scheduled parenting time/visitation every other weekend, along with such additional time as the parties may mutually agree.

10. The Existing Order further provides, in substance, that:

    a. The parties shall support the Children’s relationship with each parent; and  
    b. The parties shall refrain from disparaging one another in the presence of, or within the hearing of, the Children.

11. The Existing Order contemplates that significant decisions affecting the Children’s welfare, including but not limited to education, medical care, and substantial extracurricular commitments, shall be made jointly, consistent with the nature of joint legal custody as articulated in Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981) and Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the Existing Order on May 15, 2022, there have been material and substantial changes in circumstances affecting the Children’s welfare and the effectiveness of the joint legal custody and parenting-time arrangements, warranting modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, including Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); and Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

13. Over approximately the last year, Defendant has repeatedly and unilaterally enrolled the Children in extracurricular activities that are scheduled during Plaintiff’s regular custodial weekends without first consulting Plaintiff, despite the parties’ joint legal custody arrangement.

14. Defendant has routinely informed the Children that they are expected to attend such activities during times that the Existing Order designates as Plaintiff’s parenting time, thereby effectively altering the Children’s schedule without Plaintiff’s consent or the Court’s approval.

15. When Plaintiff has attempted to exercise her court-ordered parenting time or requested to swap weekends in order to preserve consistency with the Existing Order and the Children’s routines, Defendant has blamed Plaintiff in front of the Children for any missed activities.

16. The Children have reported to Plaintiff that Defendant calls Plaintiff “selfish” and tells the Children that Plaintiff “does not really love them” when Plaintiff raises concerns about scheduling, seeks to exercise her parenting time, or asks to adjust activity schedules to avoid conflict with her weekends.

17. Such conduct violates both the letter and the spirit of the Existing Order’s non-disparagement and co‑parenting provisions and is contrary to the Children’s emotional welfare, as recognized in cases such as Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); Haas v. Puchalski, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980); and Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

18. The Children have begun to exhibit signs of emotional distress associated with transitions between households. In particular, one of the Children has developed recurrent stomach aches on or around transition days between the parties’ homes.

19. The Children’s physical symptoms around transitions are reasonably attributable, in whole or in part, to the increased conflict, mixed messages, and disparagement that they are exposed to, as well as to the uncertainty created by conflicting weekend schedules and activity expectations.

20. Defendant’s unilateral decision-making regarding the Children’s extracurricular activities, particularly those scheduled during Plaintiff’s designated weekends, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to exercise her parenting time as ordered, thereby undermining the stability and predictability the Existing Order is intended to provide. See Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript); and Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).

21. Defendant’s disparaging statements to the Children about Plaintiff, including calling her “selfish” and questioning whether she loves the Children, directly undermine the Children’s relationship with Plaintiff and place them in the middle of parental conflict, contrary to their best interests and the requirements of the Existing Order.

22. The persistent pattern of unilateral scheduling, disparagement, and blame-shifting has eroded the parties’ ability to effectively exercise joint legal custody and to co‑parent cooperatively, which is a prerequisite for successful joint decision‑making under Massachusetts law. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); and Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

23. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that when a material change in circumstances occurs and the existing custody arrangement no longer serves the child’s best interests, the Court has a duty to modify the order to protect the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); and Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

24. The chronic conflict over scheduling during Plaintiff’s weekends, coupled with ongoing disparagement and the Children’s resulting distress, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since May 15, 2022.

25. The Children’s best interests, including their emotional stability, security, and relationships with both parents, require a more clearly-defined custodial and decision‑making arrangement that reduces conflict, clarifies authority over scheduling, and protects the Children from disparagement and blame. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); and Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

26. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child, including the child’s welfare, happiness, and development.

27. The Supreme Judicial Court has emphasized that the “best interests of the child” standard requires careful consideration of factors such as each parent’s ability to meet the child’s emotional and physical needs, to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent, and to provide a stable and nurturing environment. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

28. Plaintiff has complied with the Existing Order by supporting the Children’s relationship with Defendant and by refraining from disparaging Defendant in front of the Children.

29. Plaintiff has consistently provided the Children with primary care, stability, and day-to-day structure during the week and most non‑weekend days, in accordance with the Existing Order.

30. By contrast, Defendant’s pattern of unilateral extracurricular scheduling during Plaintiff’s court‑ordered weekends, together with his disparaging remarks about Plaintiff to the Children, demonstrates a diminished willingness or ability to promote the Children’s relationship with Plaintiff and to respect the Children’s need for consistency and emotional security.

31. The Court has recognized that a parent’s willingness to support the child’s relationship with the other parent is a significant factor in custody determinations. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Haas v. Puchalski, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980).

32. The Children’s reported physical symptoms, such as stomach aches on transition days, are consistent with anxiety related to parental conflict and mixed loyalties. Reducing conflict and clarifying custody and scheduling responsibilities will better serve the Children’s emotional and physical well-being.

33. Continuity and stability in the Children’s primary residence with Plaintiff, with clearly defined parenting time for Defendant and clear rules for extracurricular scheduling and communication, are in the Children’s best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (importance of stability and continuity).

34. It is in the Children’s best interests that their primary residence remain with Plaintiff, that Defendant’s parenting time be maintained on a consistent and predictable schedule, and that the order be modified to:

    a. Clarify that significant scheduling decisions, especially for extracurricular activities that affect the other parent’s custodial time, shall be made jointly and in advance;  
    b. Prohibit unilaterally enrolling the Children in recurring activities that conflict with the other parent’s scheduled parenting time absent written agreement; and  
    c. Strengthen and enforce non‑disparagement and co‑parenting provisions to protect the Children from being placed in the middle of parental disputes.

35. A modified order that clarifies legal custody responsibilities, confirms Plaintiff as the primary residential parent, and sets forth detailed guidelines for scheduling and communication will reduce conflict, safeguard the Children’s emotional health, and better promote both parents’ meaningful relationship with the Children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and relevant case law.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

36. Plaintiff seeks modification of the Existing Order to reflect the material change in circumstances and to better serve the Children’s best interests.

37. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the Court:

   a. Confirm that the Children’s primary residence shall continue to be with Plaintiff, Emily Robinson.  

   b. Clarify or modify legal custody so that:  
      i. The parties shall retain joint legal custody only to the extent that they are able to communicate effectively about significant matters involving the Children’s health, education, and welfare; and/or  
      ii. In the alternative, to the extent the Court finds joint decision‑making no longer workable due to Defendant’s conduct, the Court may award Plaintiff primary or final decision‑making authority with respect to extracurricular activities and scheduling, while preserving Defendant’s access to information and opportunity for input. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

   c. Order that neither parent shall enroll the Children in ongoing or recurring extracurricular activities that occur during the other parent’s scheduled parenting time without first obtaining that parent’s written consent (email shall suffice), except in emergencies or short‑term, one‑time events that do not materially interfere with existing parenting time.

   d. Provide that, if the parties cannot agree on an extracurricular activity that would materially affect the other parent’s parenting time, the default shall be that the Children attend such activity only during the enrolling parent’s time, unless the parties otherwise agree or the Court orders otherwise.

   e. Reaffirm and strengthen non‑disparagement provisions, including a specific prohibition on either parent making negative, derogatory, or blaming statements about the other parent to or in the presence of the Children, including statements that the other parent is “selfish,” does not love the Children, or is at fault for missed activities or scheduling disputes.

   f. Require that each parent affirmatively support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and avoid placing the Children in the middle of adult disputes regarding scheduling, custodial time, or parental decision‑making, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and cases such as Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) and Haas v. Puchalski, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980).

   g. Clarify that each parent shall give reasonable advance written notice (where practicable) of any proposed change in the Children’s schedules, including extracurricular activities or special events, particularly when such changes may affect the other parent’s court‑ordered parenting time.

   h. Confirm a consistent and specific parenting‑time schedule for Defendant, including every other weekend and such additional times as the parties mutually agree in writing, with priority given to reducing conflict and maintaining predictable routines for the Children.

   i. Include such further provisions regarding communication (such as use of email or a co‑parenting application), information‑sharing (school, medical, and activity information), and conflict‑resolution procedures as the Court deems appropriate to support effective co‑parenting and reduce the Children’s exposure to conflict.

   j. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the circumstances to protect the Children’s best interests.

### VII. LEGAL BASIS

38. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may, upon a complaint after a judgment for divorce (or applicable custody judgment), make any further order relative to the care, custody, and maintenance of the minor children as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require. The same principles apply to non‑marital custody matters under G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

39. Massachusetts appellate decisions, including Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); and Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010), establish that:

   a. A prior custody and parenting‑time judgment may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances; and  
   b. The modification must serve the best interests of the children.

40. The pattern of unilateral decision‑making about the Children’s schedules, the undermining of Plaintiff’s relationship with the Children through disparaging comments, and the Children’s emerging physical symptoms and distress on transition days together constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children’s welfare.

41. A modified order, as requested herein, will reduce conflict, ensure clearer decision‑making authority, preserve the Children’s stable primary residence with Plaintiff, and protect them from disparagement and divided loyalties, thereby serving their best interests under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the above‑cited cases.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Robinson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2022 custody and parenting‑time order;

2. Modify the Existing Order to confirm that the Children’s primary residence shall be with Plaintiff;

3. Modify and clarify legal custody and decision‑making authority, particularly with respect to extracurricular activities and scheduling, as set forth above;

4. Enter detailed provisions regarding extracurricular activities, scheduling, communication, and non‑disparagement consistent with the Children’s best interests and as outlined in Section VI of this Complaint;

5. Enter a revised and specific parenting‑time schedule for Defendant that maintains his relationship with the Children while minimizing conflict and preserving stability for the Children;

6. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor Children.

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,  
EMILY ROBINSON,  
Pro Se
