      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns mandatory statutory damages of at least three months\u2019 rent under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 for breach of quiet enjoyment, regardless of actual loss. DiMarzo is a Chapter 93A insurance bad-faith case about multiple damages under c. 93A, not about landlord-tenant law, c. 186, \u00a7 14, or a minimum three-months-rent measure of damages. While the opinion discusses that c. 93A allows multiple damages based on \u201cactual damages,\u201d it does not interpret c. 186, \u00a7 14 or hold that a tenant is entitled to not less than three months\u2019 rent irrespective of actual monetary loss. The case is therefore inapposite to the specific proposition stated.",

      "support_reasoning": "Wolfberg does interpret G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 to allow a minimum recovery of three months\u2019 rent (the \u2018triple rent\u2019 clause) for violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, regardless of the size of actual damages. However, the case is cited here for a different, more specific proposition: that a plaintiff is entitled to at least three months\u2019 rent under \u00a7 14 even when she is also recovering multiple damages under another remedial statute (here, G.L. c. 93A). Wolfberg holds the opposite on this point, expressly disallowing recovery under \u00a7 14 where the tenant has already recovered more than both actual damages and three months\u2019 rent under c. 93A based on the same facts, to avoid duplicative recovery.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cGeneral Laws c. 186, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1974, c. 192, \u00a7 1, allows tenants to recover \u2018actual and consequential damages or three month\u2019s rent, whichever is greater,\u2019 for violation of that statute. \u2026 We have held recently that duplicative recovery of actual damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, and other common law and statutory claims will not be permitted\u2026 We now hold that, where a tenant has been awarded in excess of both three months\u2019 rent and actual damages under G. L. c. 93A on claims based upon the same set of facts as in a concurrent claim for damages for violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, the recovery of damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, would be duplicative and, therefore, will not be allowed.\u201d"
