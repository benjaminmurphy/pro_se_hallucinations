COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff Jessica Hart (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Hart”), proceeding pro se, brings this action against Defendant Mike Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hart is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff regularly walked on Maple Avenue in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mike Thompson is an individual residing at 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts (“the Property”), and at all relevant times was the owner and person in control of the Property, including the large maple tree located in front of the Property adjacent to the public sidewalk.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 9 because the events and occurrences giving rise to this claim took place in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and Defendant resides in Berkshire County.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled the Property located at 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

7. In front of the Property there is a large, mature maple tree growing adjacent to and overhanging the public sidewalk on Maple Avenue.

8. For a substantial period of time prior to July 15, 2023, one of the major branches of that maple tree extended over the sidewalk used by pedestrians, including Plaintiff.

9. That branch was visibly cracked, drooping, and appeared damaged, decayed, or otherwise compromised, such that a reasonable person would recognize it as hazardous and at risk of falling.

10. Plaintiff personally observed the cracked and drooping condition of the branch on multiple occasions in the months before July 15, 2023, when walking on Maple Avenue.

11. Neighbors of Defendant, who also used the sidewalk, likewise observed the dangerous condition of the cracked branch.

12. Upon information and belief, prior to July 15, 2023, one or more neighbors notified Defendant and/or discussed with Defendant the obvious danger posed by the cracked branch overhanging the public sidewalk and suggested that he have it inspected and/or removed by a qualified arborist.

13. In response to those concerns, Defendant stated that he would “deal with it in the spring” or words to that effect, but failed to have the branch promptly inspected, stabilized, pruned, or removed, and did not otherwise correct the dangerous condition.

14. Defendant did not post any warning signs, barricade the sidewalk area under the cracked branch, or take other reasonable precautions to protect pedestrians from the foreseeable risk that the branch might fall.

15. By reason of the visible damage, the repeated observations by neighbors, and the direct communications made to him about the condition, Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the branch created an unreasonable risk of harm to foreseeable users of the sidewalk, including Plaintiff.

16. On July 15, 2023, at approximately midday, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, while carrying grocery bags.

17. At that date and time, a typical summer thunderstorm was occurring in the area. The weather consisted of ordinary rain, wind, and thunder typical of summer storms in Western Massachusetts, without tornado warnings, hurricanes, or other extraordinary or “Act of God” conditions.

18. As Plaintiff walked under or near the large cracked branch, the branch suddenly snapped and fell from the maple tree.

19. The falling branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground.

20. Plaintiff immediately experienced pain in her shoulder and back, as well as shock and emotional distress from having been struck and knocked down by the branch.

21. Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for her injuries, including her shoulder and back, and was diagnosed with a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.

22. As a direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for evaluation, treatment, and related care.

23. As a further direct and proximate result, Plaintiff was medically unable to work at her retail job for approximately one week, causing her to lose about $600 in wages.

24. Plaintiff also suffered physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities from the shoulder strain and bruising, as well as emotional distress and anxiety when walking near large trees and along Maple Avenue.

25. The condition of the cracked, drooping branch overhanging the sidewalk was not open and obvious in a manner that would allow Plaintiff to evaluate its structural integrity or the imminence of failure; Plaintiff, as an ordinary pedestrian without arboricultural expertise, had no reasonable way to determine when or under what conditions the branch might fail.

26. Even if the dangerous condition of the tree branch were considered open and obvious, Defendant’s duty of reasonable care extended to taking steps to eliminate or guard against that danger where, as here, Defendant reasonably should have anticipated that lawful users of the sidewalk would proceed to walk under the branch and could not avoid it without undue burden or risk. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 379–80 (2010).

27. Defendant, having been specifically alerted to the risk and having observed the compromised, drooping condition of the branch, could and should have reasonably foreseen that during ordinary New England weather, including routine summer thunderstorms, the branch could fall and injure a pedestrian.

28. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps—such as inspection by an arborist, pruning, support, or removal of the obviously compromised branch—to eliminate or reduce the risk to pedestrians, including Plaintiff.

29. The foreseeable and natural consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care with respect to the hazardous tree branch was that the branch would eventually fail and fall onto the adjacent public sidewalk, injuring a passerby.

30. The harm suffered by Plaintiff on July 15, 2023, was the precise type of harm that made the condition unreasonably dangerous in the first place.

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (SOLE COUNT)

31. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, landowners and persons in control of real property owe a duty to all lawful entrants, including pedestrians using adjacent public ways who are foreseeably exposed to conditions on the land, to exercise reasonable care to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995); Blood v. Dewey, 210 Mass. 62, 64–65 (1911).

33. This duty of reasonable care includes the obligation to remedy or reasonably protect against dangerous conditions on the property that pose a foreseeable risk of injury to persons lawfully on or immediately adjacent to the premises and to take reasonable steps to inspect for and correct such conditions. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 379–80 (2010); Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 343, 343A (1965), as cited in Massachusetts cases including Id. and Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

34. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, maintenance, inspection, and control of the maple tree and its limbs that extended over the public sidewalk adjacent to his Property. See Gage v. Westfield, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 683–85 (1989) (recognizing liability where landowner’s tree or limb creates hazard to travelers on way); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 363, cmt. b.

35. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the large, cracked, and drooping branch overhanging the sidewalk was in a dangerous and defective condition and created an unreasonable risk of harm to foreseeable pedestrians, including Plaintiff. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (duty arises where defendant knows or should know of unreasonable risk of harm).

36. Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition because:

   a. The crack, droop, and compromised condition of the branch were visible and apparent for an extended period of time prior to July 15, 2023;

   b. Neighbors directly communicated their concerns about the branch to Defendant and suggested he obtain an arborist’s evaluation;

   c. Defendant himself acknowledged the issue by stating he would “deal with it in the spring,” demonstrating his awareness of a needed corrective action.

See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermkts., Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 784–86 (2007) (notice may be inferred where condition is apparent and persists for sufficient period).

37. Despite this actual and/or constructive knowledge, Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to remedy the danger, including, but not limited to, failing to:

   a. Timely have the tree and branch inspected by a qualified arborist or other competent person;

   b. Prune, cable, brace, or remove the cracked branch;

   c. Restrict access to the area of the sidewalk under the dangerous branch;

   d. Warn Plaintiff and other pedestrians of the hazardous condition.

38. A reasonable property owner in Defendant’s position, having received repeated reports of a cracked branch overhanging a pedestrian sidewalk, would have foreseen the risk that the branch could fall and injure a passerby, particularly during ordinary New England storms.

39. The weather conditions on July 15, 2023, were typical of a summer thunderstorm in Massachusetts and did not constitute an extraordinary or unforeseeable “Act of God” that would break the chain of causation. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing the branch to remain in a compromised condition until it failed during routine weather. See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (foreseeable natural events do not absolve negligence); see also Gage v. Westfield, 26 Mass. App. Ct. at 683–85.

40. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable in negligence when the defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff, breaches that duty, and the breach proximately causes injury and damages to the plaintiff. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

41. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by failing to take any or adequate steps to inspect, maintain, repair, or remove the clearly hazardous branch that extended over the public sidewalk, despite his knowledge of the risk and the foreseeability of harm to pedestrians.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of duty, the branch snapped and fell on July 15, 2023, striking Plaintiff and causing the injuries and damages described above.

43. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care with respect to the dangerous condition of the tree branch.

44. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of, nor did she consent to, being struck by a falling branch. Plaintiff’s conduct in using the public sidewalk for ordinary pedestrian travel was reasonable and lawful.

45. To the extent comparative negligence is raised as a defense, Plaintiff denies any negligence on her part. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any causal negligence attributable to Plaintiff is less than the negligence of Defendant and therefore does not bar recovery, and Plaintiff’s damages should be reduced, if at all, only in proportion to any percentage of negligence found to be attributable to her.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Medical expenses in an approximate amount of $2,500, and such additional medical expenses as may be incurred in the future;

   b. Lost wages in an approximate amount of $600, and any further loss of earning capacity to be proven at trial;

   c. Physical pain and suffering;

   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life, including fear and discomfort when walking in the area of the incident or near similar trees;

   e. Other special and general damages according to proof at trial.

47. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence and to seek additional damages as discovery and investigation may warrant, consistent with Mass. R. Civ. P. 15.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hart respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mike Thompson, and award the following relief:

A. Compensation for medical expenses, in an amount to be determined at trial, presently estimated at approximately $2,500;

C. Compensation for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact;

D. Compensation for any future medical expenses and loss of earning capacity proved at trial;

E. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

F. Costs of this action as permitted by law;

G. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

### VI. JURY DEMAND
