Docket No.: ___________________

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)  
------------------------------------------------------

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Emma Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Emma Thompson**, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the Mother and primary residential parent of the minor child, **Sophia Miller**, age 10.

2. The Defendant, **David Miller** (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the Father of the minor child, Sophia Miller.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the **Middlesex Probate and Family Court** pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 29; M.G.L. c. 209C, §§ 20, 21; and M.G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this Court issued the current custody and parenting order, the parties and child reside or are present in Middlesex County, and the best interests of the minor child require this Court’s intervention.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On or about **May 15, 2022**, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Parenting Order (the “Existing Judgment”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child, Sophia Miller.

5. Under the Existing Judgment:

   a. The parties share **joint legal custody** of Sophia Miller;  

   b. Mother, Emma Thompson, is designated the **primary residential parent**;  

   c. Father, David Miller, is granted **substantial weekend parenting time**, including **Sunday overnights**; and  

   d. The parties are required to **cooperate on school matters**, including but not limited to attendance, tutoring, and educational decisions, and to **keep each other informed** regarding Sophia’s schooling and related issues.

6. At the time the Existing Judgment was entered, Sophia was **performing well in school**, maintaining regular attendance, and there were no significant academic, attendance, or truancy concerns.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the entry of the Existing Judgment on May 15, 2022, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** relating to Sophia’s school attendance and academic performance.

8. Over approximately the **past year**, Father has repeatedly **kept Sophia home from school on Mondays** following his weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnights.

9. Father has characterized these Monday absences as “**mental health days**,” but:

   a. There are **no doctor’s notes** or medical documentation supporting these absences;  

   b. Father has not sought nor obtained any formal recommendation from a licensed medical or mental health provider that Sophia should be kept out of school on a recurring basis; and  

   c. Father has not consistently communicated with Mother in advance regarding these absences, nor has he obtained Mother’s agreement that such absences are appropriate and in Sophia’s best interests.

10. As a result of these repeated Monday absences, Sophia has incurred a **significant number of unexcused or questionable absences**, and the school has issued **truancy warnings** to the parents.

11. The truancy warnings and documented absences are new circumstances that **did not exist** at the time of the Existing Judgment and constitute a material change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See **M.G.L. c. 76, §§ 1–2** (compulsory school attendance and truancy provisions).

12. In addition to the attendance issues, Father has **regularly refused or failed to bring Sophia to scheduled tutoring sessions** that fall during his parenting time on weekends.

13. These tutoring sessions were arranged to address Sophia’s **declining academic performance**, including **dropped grades and lower test scores**, which are themselves a marked change from her earlier satisfactory performance at the time of the Existing Judgment.

14. Sophia’s **grades and test scores have significantly declined** over the past year, as documented by report cards, progress reports, and standardized test results provided by the school.

15. The school has expressed concern to Mother regarding:

   a. Sophia’s **attendance**, including the pattern of Monday absences following Father’s weekend; and  

   b. Sophia’s **academic performance**, which has declined in connection with these absences and inconsistent participation in tutoring.

16. Father’s pattern of keeping Sophia home for non‑medically‑documented “mental health days,” combined with his failure or refusal to ensure attendance at tutoring during his parenting time, is **inconsistent with Sophia’s educational needs** and **contrary to the statutory policy** that children attend school regularly. See **M.G.L. c. 76, §§ 1, 2**.

17. Father’s conduct has **substantially interfered** with Sophia’s regular school attendance and her ability to benefit from tutoring and other educational supports, thereby adversely affecting her **best interests**, including her emotional, intellectual, and social well‑being.

18. The parties’ **joint legal custody arrangement regarding educational decisions** presupposes that both parents will act cooperatively and in the minor child’s best interests. See **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)** (joint legal custody requires capacity to communicate and cooperate in the child’s best interests).

19. Father’s unilateral decisions to keep Sophia home from school, without medical justification and over Mother’s objection or without her informed consent, demonstrate a **breakdown in the parties’ ability to cooperate** on critical school matters and have resulted in **actual harm** to Sophia’s educational progress.

20. The Supreme Judicial Court has made clear that a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting a child’s welfare, coupled with the child’s **best interests**, is the standard for modifying custody or parenting orders. See **Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981)**; **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**.

21. The Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court have further recognized that modification is appropriate when the existing order no longer serves the child’s best interests due to material changes arising after the order. See **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**; **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**; **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)**.

22. Under these principles, the pattern of school absences, truancy concerns, and academic decline constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since May 15, 2022, directly affecting Sophia’s welfare and rendering the Existing Judgment concerning legal custody and school‑night parenting time no longer in her best interests.

23. Mother has attempted to address these issues with Father informally and to **cooperate** on school matters as required by the Existing Judgment, including discussing attendance, tutoring, and the truancy warnings.

24. Despite Mother’s efforts, Father has **continued** to keep Sophia home from school on Mondays after his weekend parenting time and has **continued** to fail to ensure her attendance at tutoring sessions, thereby perpetuating the problem.

25. The child’s **educational stability and academic progress** are central components of her best interests. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–842** (stability and continuity of schooling and environment are important best‑interests factors).

26. Because of Father’s conduct and the resulting negative impact on Sophia’s schooling and academic performance, it is in Sophia’s best interests that the Court **modify the Existing Judgment** to:

   a. Grant Mother **final decision‑making authority on school attendance and educational decisions** (sometimes referred to as “tie‑breaking authority”) while maintaining joint legal custody in other respects; and/or  

   b. Adjust Father’s parenting schedule so that he **does not exercise overnights on school nights**, or in particular on **Sunday nights**, where his pattern is to keep Sophia home on Monday without justification, thereby ensuring consistent school attendance.

27. The requested modification is **narrowly tailored** to address the specific problem of school attendance and academic decline and is not sought to interfere with Sophia’s relationship with Father, but rather to protect and advance her **best interests in education, stability, and development**.

### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

28. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which authorizes the Probate and Family Court to “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children” upon a **material and substantial change in the circumstances** of the parties or the child and where modification is in the child’s **best interests**.

29. To the extent jurisdiction arises or is analogous under **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**, the Court similarly has authority to modify custody and parenting orders concerning a child born to parents who are not married to each other, upon a material and substantial change in circumstances and in accordance with the child’s best interests.

30. The Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that the moving party in a custody or parenting‑time modification proceeding must demonstrate:

   a. A **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the prior judgment; and  

   b. That the proposed modification is in the **best interests of the child**.  

   See **Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981)**; **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996)**; **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**.

31. A deterioration in a child’s school performance, the emergence of attendance or truancy issues, and the breakdown of parents’ cooperation in making educational decisions all constitute factors that may support a finding of material change and justify modification to safeguard the child’s welfare. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–842** (importance of educational stability and parental cooperation); **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–406 (1981)** (joint legal custody requires ability to cooperate in decisions regarding education and welfare).

32. The Court is charged with placing the child’s welfare above parental disputes. See **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596** (the “paramount concern” is the best interests of the child); **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. at 711–712** (best‑interests standard governs custody‑related determinations).

33. In addition, Massachusetts law regarding school attendance and truancy, **M.G.L. c. 76, §§ 1–2**, reflects a strong public policy that school‑age children attend school regularly, and that parents take reasonable measures to ensure attendance. This statutory framework underscores that repeated unjustified absences are contrary to both statutory policy and the child’s best interests.

34. Under **M.G.L. c. 215, § 6**, this Court has broad equity powers in matters of child custody and welfare, enabling it to fashion orders that protect the minor child’s best interests, including granting one parent final decision‑making authority on particular issues or adjusting parenting schedules.

35. Here, Mother satisfies the applicable legal standard for modification because:

   a. There has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since May 15, 2022, including a pattern of Monday absences during Father’s parenting time, truancy warnings, Sophia’s declining grades and test scores, and Father’s failure to support agreed tutoring; and  

   b. The requested modification—granting Mother final decision‑making authority regarding school attendance and educational matters, and/or reducing or eliminating Father’s school‑night overnights—is **necessary and appropriate to serve Sophia’s best interests**.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

36. Mother requests that the Court **modify the Existing Judgment** dated May 15, 2022, so that:

   a. The parties shall continue to have **joint legal custody** of Sophia Miller in general, **except** that **Mother shall have final decision‑making authority with respect to school attendance and all educational matters**, including but not limited to:  

      i. Decisions regarding daily school attendance and excused versus unexcused absences;  
      ii. Selection, scheduling, and continuation of tutoring and other educational support services;  
      iii. Responses to truancy warnings, attendance plans, and any intervention recommended by the school; and  
      iv. Coordination and approval of any “mental health days” or similar non‑medical absences, which shall be permitted only with Mother’s consent or pursuant to a written recommendation from a licensed provider.  

   b. Father shall **not have Sunday overnight parenting time** (or, in the alternative, other school‑night overnights as the Court deems appropriate), and his weekend parenting time shall end at a time on Sunday that ensures Sophia’s **rest and readiness for school on Monday**, for example, no later than **6:00 p.m. on Sundays**, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties and consistent with Sophia’s school schedule.

   c. During his parenting time, Father shall **ensure that Sophia attends all scheduled tutoring sessions and educational supports** unless Mother agrees otherwise in writing or unless there is a bona fide emergency or illness, in which case Father shall promptly notify Mother and, as appropriate, the school and tutor.

   d. The parties shall **communicate in a timely manner** regarding school notices, report cards, progress reports, discipline reports, and any attendance or truancy‑related communications, and shall each promptly provide the other with copies of any such documents they receive from the school.

   e. To the extent necessary to implement the above, the Court may direct that the school recognize Mother as having **final decision‑making authority for educational matters**, including attendance, while maintaining that both parents are entitled to access educational records pursuant to applicable law.

   f. The Court may make such additional or clarifying orders as are **necessary to protect Sophia’s educational welfare**, including any reasonable limitations on school‑night overnights or other parenting‑time adjustments narrowly tailored to ensure consistent school attendance and academic support.

37. Mother does **not** seek to eliminate Father’s relationship with Sophia, but seeks this modification solely to **stabilize Sophia’s schooling**, address the truancy and academic issues, and ensure that both parents act in a manner consistent with the child’s **best interests** and Massachusetts law.

### VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Emma Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the Existing Judgment on May 15, 2022, including but not limited to Sophia’s repeated Monday absences during Father’s parenting time, truancy warnings from the school, declining grades and test scores, and Father’s failure to ensure attendance at tutoring sessions;

2. **Find** that modification of the Existing Judgment is **necessary and appropriate** to serve the **best interests of the minor child**, Sophia Miller;

3. **Modify** the Existing Judgment to provide that the parties shall continue to share **joint legal custody** of Sophia generally, but that **Mother shall have final decision‑making authority regarding school attendance and all educational matters**, as set forth above;

4. **Modify** the Existing Judgment to **reduce or eliminate Father’s school‑night overnights**, specifically by removing his **Sunday overnight** and ordering that his weekend parenting time end on Sundays at or before a specified time that allows for Sophia’s adequate rest and preparation for school;

5. **Order** that Father shall **ensure Sophia’s attendance at all scheduled tutoring and educational support sessions** during his parenting time, absent mutual written agreement or bona fide emergency or illness, and shall promptly communicate with Mother regarding any changes;

6. **Order** that both parents shall **promptly share** with each other all school‑related communications, including but not limited to report cards, progress reports, attendance reports, truancy notices, and disciplinary notices;

7. **Authorize** Mother to communicate to Sophia’s school that she holds **final decision‑making authority** as to educational matters, while preserving both parents’ rights to access educational records;

8. **Grant** such other and further relief as this Court deems **just and proper** to protect Sophia Miller’s educational welfare and best interests;

9. **Schedule** this matter for a hearing at the earliest practicable date.

Respectfully submitted,
