---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for the Premises with Defendant as landlord, at a monthly rent of $1,200.00.

7. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid, or been ready and willing to pay, the monthly rent of $1,200.00 as required by the tenancy.

8. Plaintiff has used the Premises as her residence and has kept her apartment, and in particular her kitchen, in a clean and sanitary condition.

9. Approximately three months before the filing of this Complaint, around early September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing substantial and recurring mouse droppings in her kitchen, including on counters, in cabinets, and near food storage areas.

10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mouse infestation and the presence of droppings in her kitchen.

11. In response, Defendant placed a few mouse traps in or around Plaintiff’s apartment. These traps caught at most two mice.

12. Despite the initial traps, Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings on a regular basis, including on a weekly basis, for months thereafter.

13. Plaintiff again notified Defendant that she was continuing to find mouse droppings and that the infestation had not been resolved.

14. Defendant arranged for a single visit by an exterminator to the property. The exterminator inspected and treated the Premises.

15. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that, in his professional opinion, the building likely required more comprehensive and ongoing pest control measures to address the mouse problem effectively, including sealing entry points and possibly additional visits or building‑wide treatment.

16. Plaintiff communicated to Defendant that the exterminator believed that more comprehensive treatment was necessary.

17. Defendant refused to authorize any further, more comprehensive extermination or building‑wide pest control services, stating that such measures were “overkill” and “too expensive.”

18. Defendant further told Plaintiff that the presence of mice and mouse droppings was “normal for older buildings,” and blamed Plaintiff by suggesting she needed to keep her kitchen cleaner, despite Plaintiff’s diligent housekeeping.

19. After the exterminator’s single visit, Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings in her kitchen on a regular basis, including weekly, and the infestation was not resolved.

20. As a direct result of the persistent mouse infestation and contamination, Plaintiff was forced to throw away food items that were likely exposed to mice, including any box or bag that was not tightly sealed.

21. Over the past several months, Plaintiff has had to discard approximately $200.00 worth of food that was likely contaminated or unsafe due to mouse activity.

22. In order to protect her remaining food from contamination and mouse droppings, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers and related supplies for all of her food items, at a cost of approximately $80.00.

23. The ongoing presence of mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen has caused Plaintiff significant anxiety and distress and has interfered with her ability to feel safe, comfortable, and healthy in her own home.

24. Plaintiff has been constantly anxious about cooking and eating in her kitchen due to fear of contamination and disease associated with mouse droppings.

25. The persistent infestation and droppings have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including ordinary activities such as food storage, meal preparation, eating, and entertaining guests.

26. The conditions at the Premises, specifically the ongoing mouse infestation and contamination of food preparation and storage areas, render the apartment unfit for human habitation and unsafe, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

27. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and related provisions, an owner must maintain the dwelling free from chronic or persistent infestation of rodents and must take all necessary measures to exterminate such infestation and prevent its recurrence.

28. Defendant, after receiving notice from Plaintiff of the mouse infestation, failed to take adequate and reasonable steps to abate the infestation and prevent its recurrence, and limited his efforts to a few traps and one exterminator visit, despite knowledge that the problem persisted.

29. Defendant’s failure to correct the infestation and his decision not to authorize further or more comprehensive pest control were deliberate choices, not mere oversights, and were made with knowledge that Plaintiff continued to experience mouse droppings and that her kitchen remained contaminated.

30. At all relevant times, Defendant had the power and ability to arrange for proper extermination, building‑wide treatment, sealing of entry points, and continued pest‑control measures, but failed and refused to do so.

31. At all relevant times, Plaintiff complied with her obligations as a tenant, including keeping the Premises reasonably clean and promptly reporting the infestation to Defendant.

32. The continuing presence of mouse droppings and the risk of contamination and disease substantially and materially impaired Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

33. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, including but not limited to approximately $200.00 in discarded food and $80.00 in costs for plastic food storage containers, as a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to address the infestation.

34. Plaintiff has also suffered non‑economic harm including loss of use and enjoyment of her home, anxiety, inconvenience, discomfort, and interference with ordinary residential life, all proximately caused by Defendant’s conduct.

35. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Defendant has not undertaken sufficient measures to eradicate the mouse infestation or otherwise remedy the conditions that interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

36. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 35 above as if fully set forth herein.

37. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease and tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment protecting tenants from serious interference by the landlord with the use and enjoyment of their rented premises. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

38. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who violates this covenant is liable for actual and/or statutory damages.

39. A landlord’s deliberate failure to correct conditions that are in violation of the State Sanitary Code and that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–90 (1994).

40. The infestation of rodents and the presence of mouse droppings in food preparation and storage areas are serious sanitary‑code violations that render an apartment unfit for human habitation and materially impair the value and character of the premises. See 105 C.M.R. 410.550 (rodent infestation); 105 C.M.R. 410.020 (definitions of “unfit for human habitation” and “sanitary”); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979).

41. When a landlord, after receiving notice, fails within a reasonable time to correct conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code and materially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises, the landlord has “directly or indirectly” interfered with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 788–90.

42. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation and the persistent mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen, both through Plaintiff’s oral complaints and through the exterminator’s professional assessment that more comprehensive treatment was necessary.

43. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take further reasonable steps to correct the infestation after an initial minimal response (a few traps and one exterminator visit), and affirmatively chose not to implement the more comprehensive measures recommended by a professional exterminator.

44. Defendant’s refusal to authorize further extermination or building‑wide treatment, despite knowledge of the ongoing infestation, was a willful and knowing failure to remedy conditions that seriously interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

45. Defendant’s conduct was not an isolated act of negligence, but rather a continuing failure to act over the course of months, after repeated notice, and in the face of ongoing, obvious, unsanitary, and unsafe conditions. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–86 (1994) (repeated failure to act after notice supports liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

46. The presence of rodents and droppings in the kitchen interfered with the basic residential purposes of the tenancy, including the safe preparation and consumption of food, storage of groceries, and use of the kitchen as an ordinary and essential part of the dwelling. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 717–19 (1977) (interference with normal residential use constitutes breach of quiet enjoyment).

47. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment need not be motivated by malice; it is sufficient that Defendant’s deliberate inaction in the face of known, serious, code‑violating conditions foreseeably and substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use of the Premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–05; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 788–89.

48. The State Sanitary Code violations at the Premises, including chronic rodent infestation, are evidence of the uninhabitable condition of the apartment and support Plaintiff’s claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. at 199–201; McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977).

49. Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code also constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, which, while not separately pleaded here, demonstrates the seriousness of the conditions and further supports the conclusion that Defendant’s conduct substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See Hemingway v. Bradshaw, 364 Mass. 239, 242–45 (1973); Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 199–201.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Out‑of‑pocket monetary losses including approximately $200.00 in discarded food and approximately $80.00 for plastic storage containers and related items;  

   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, including interference with the normal use of the kitchen and the apartment as a safe and sanitary home;  

   c. Anxiety, distress, inconvenience, and discomfort associated with living in unsanitary, rodent‑infested conditions and fear of contamination and illness.

51. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 790–91.

52. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00. Three months’ rent therefore equals $3,600.00.

53. Plaintiff’s actual monetary damages attributable to the infestation (food loss and containers) are approximately $280.00, and her non‑economic harms (loss of use, discomfort, anxiety, interference with ordinary life) are substantial and ongoing.

54. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either her actual damages, including compensation for loss of use and enjoyment, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as court costs and, if applicable, reasonable attorney’s fees. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 111–12; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 790–91.
