See G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404\u201305 (1981).",

      "support_reasoning": "Rolde discusses custody and visitation under the best-interests standard and notes the value of frequent and continuing contact with both parents, but it does not address adjusting midweek overnights, transportation responsibilities, or detailed weekend scheduling to minimize school disruption. The case simply affirms a reduction in visitation time, without engaging in the kind of schedule\u2011tailoring described in the proposition. Thus, it supports the broad best\u2011interests and continuing-relationship principles, but not the specific scheduling authority asserted in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe husband does argue, however, that it is most often preferred that both parents participate in the child rearing process and in the major decisions that attach thereto. We agree with the precept that \u2018the law sees a value in \u201cfrequent and continuing contact\u201d of the child[ren] with both . . . parents.\u2019 Felton v. Felton, supra at 234, quoting from In re Marriage of Murga, 103 Cal. App. 3d 498, 503 (1980)\u2026 Children are entitled to the love, companionship and concern of both parents\u2026\u201d"
