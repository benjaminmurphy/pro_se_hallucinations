COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY OF MINOR CHILD)  
-----------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Lucas Johnson, as parent and next friend of his minor son, [initials L.J.], for his Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Lucas Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Plymouth County, Massachusetts. He is the father and legal guardian of his minor son, L.J., age eight at the time of the incident described herein.

2. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of his minor child pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 17(b), which authorizes a minor to sue by a parent or next friend.

3. Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts nonprofit or other organized entity operating a community and after‑school program facility located at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA 02301.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the premises at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA 02301, including the after‑school program and gymnasium where the incident occurred.

5. At all relevant times, Defendant acted through its officers, employees, agents, and/or servants, all of whom were acting within the course and scope of their employment or agency, so as to render Defendant vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 19A, because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court Department.

7. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8, because the cause of action arose in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and Defendant’s principal place of business and the relevant premises are located in Brockton.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. Defendant operates an after‑school program at its facility at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA 02301, which includes use of a gymnasium where children play under the supervision of staff.

9. Defendant advertises and represents to parents, including Plaintiff, that children enrolled in its after‑school program will be supervised at all times while in the gym and other program areas.

10. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s son, L.J., then eight years old and small for his age, was attending Defendant’s after‑school program in the gym at Defendant’s Brockton facility.

11. At the time of the incident, there were approximately twenty (20) children present in the gym, including L.J.

12. Defendant’s policies and/or standard practice called for at least two staff members to supervise children in the gym when groups of this size were present.

13. On the date in question, however, only one staff member remained in the gym; the second staff member left the gym area to go to an office to do paperwork, leaving a single staff member responsible for supervising approximately twenty children engaged in active physical play.

14. The staff member who remained in the gym was positioned near the bleachers and was largely focused on her cell phone rather than actively supervising the children.

15. While supervision was inadequate and inattentive, two older boys, estimated to be around twelve years old, began engaging in a rough tackle‑style game on the hardwood gym floor.

16. The rough play involved forceful tackling and physical contact that posed an obvious and unreasonable risk of injury to smaller and younger children like L.J.

17. Several children in the gym observed the dangerous rough play and notified the supervising staff member that the older boys were tackling each other and others in a dangerous manner.

18. Despite having actual notice of the rough and dangerous play, the supervising staff member failed to intervene, instruct the boys to stop, separate them, increase supervision, or take any other reasonable steps to protect the children.

19. Instead, the staff member responded dismissively by stating words to the effect of “boys will be boys,” and took no effective action to correct or control the situation.

20. Defendant’s employee’s failure to respond to the reports of dangerous roughhousing allowed the unsafe condition to continue and escalate.

21. While the dangerous conduct continued unabated, one of the larger, older boys forcefully tackled L.J., who was significantly smaller and younger than the older boys.

22. As a result of the tackle, L.J. was thrown to the hardwood floor and struck his head, losing consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

23. When L.J. lost consciousness, the gym had only the single, inattentive staff member present, and the level and quality of supervision was grossly inadequate for the number and ages of the children and the nature of the activities occurring.

24. Emergency medical attention was required. L.J. was transported to an emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.

25. L.J. suffered and continues to suffer from concussion‑related symptoms, including but not limited to headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, sleep disruption, and behavioral and emotional changes.

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent supervision and failure to protect L.J. from foreseeable harm, Plaintiff has incurred approximately $5,000 in medical expenses, including emergency room treatment, diagnostic tests, follow‑up appointments, and related medical care.

27. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, L.J. missed several days of school and suffered loss of normal childhood activities, including play, sports, and social interaction, during his recovery.

28. L.J. experienced significant pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and inconvenience, and he remains at risk of ongoing or future problems related to his head injury.

29. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that:

   a. Groups of approximately twenty children in a gym require active and attentive supervision by more than one adult staff member to maintain safety;

   b. Permitting older, larger boys to engage in rough tackling games on a hardwood floor creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury, especially to younger and smaller children; and  

   c. Failure to respond to reports of dangerous roughhousing and physical aggression among children in a gym exposes children to foreseeable harm.

30. Reasonable supervision and reasonable responses to the reports of dangerous play—such as stopping the tackling game, separating the older boys, re‑directing activities, or ensuring proper staffing—would have prevented or substantially reduced the risk of the injury that befell L.J.

31. Defendant’s conduct, through its agents and employees, fell below the standard of reasonable care owed to children entrusted to its supervision, and this failure was a direct and proximate cause of L.J.’s injuries and damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER)

32. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as though fully set forth herein.

#### A. Duty

33. Under Massachusetts law, a person or entity that undertakes the supervision and care of a child owes that child a duty of reasonable care to protect him from reasonably foreseeable harms. See Irwin v. Ware, 392 Mass. 745, 756–57 (1984) (duty of care arises where harm is reasonably foreseeable); Remy v. MacDonald, 440 Mass. 675, 677–78 (2004).

34. Defendant, by operating an after‑school program, accepting custody of L.J., inviting him onto its premises, and representing that children would be supervised at all times in the gym, undertook a duty to exercise reasonable care in the supervision, protection, and control of children in its charge, including L.J. See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 52–54 (1983) (duty of care arising from special relationship where institution takes charge of safety of those in its custody); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

35. As a possessor of land open to invitees, Defendant owed L.J. the duty to use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect him against foreseeable risks created by the conduct of third persons on the premises. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708–09 (1973); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

36. Defendant further had a duty to adequately hire, train, supervise, and oversee its staff members to ensure that they exercised reasonable care in supervising children. See Foster v. The Loft, Inc., 26 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 290–92 (1988).

#### B. Breach

37. Defendant, through its agents, servants, and/or employees, breached its duties of care owed to L.J., including but not limited to the following negligent acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to provide a sufficient number of competent staff members to safely supervise approximately twenty children in the gym on September 15, 2023;

   b. Permitting one staff member to leave the gym to perform paperwork, thereby knowingly reducing supervision below a reasonably safe level;

   c. Failing to require continuous, active, and attentive supervision of the children engaged in physical play in the gym;

   d. Allowing the only supervising staff member to remain distracted by her cellular phone rather than observing and monitoring the children;

   e. Failing to promptly investigate and respond to reports by children that older boys were engaging in rough tackle‑style play on the hardwood gym floor;

   f. Failing to stop, control, or redirect the dangerous roughhousing and physical aggression once Defendant’s employee had actual knowledge of it;

   g. Failing to separate older, larger boys from younger, smaller children where the nature of the play presented an obvious risk of injury;

   h. Failing to adopt, implement, or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for supervision of children in the gym, including minimum staffing requirements and rules prohibiting rough tackle games;

   i. Failing to adequately train and supervise staff members on appropriate responses to reports of dangerous behavior and the need to intervene in unsafe physical play; and

   j. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care in the supervision and protection of L.J. while he was in Defendant’s custody and on Defendant’s premises.

38. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care that an ordinarily prudent after‑school program operator and supervisor of children would exercise under like circumstances. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 53–54.

39. The risk that unsupervised or inadequately supervised children—particularly older boys—would engage in rough play or tackling on a hardwood gym floor, causing serious injury to smaller, younger children, was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant. See Irwin, 392 Mass. at 756–57; Davis, 420 Mass. at 744–45 (duty to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable acts of third persons).

40. Defendant’s disregard of repeated warnings from children that dangerous rough play was occurring, and its staff member’s response of “boys will be boys,” constitute clear evidence of a breach of the duty of reasonable care owed to L.J.

#### C. Causation

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions described above, L.J. was tackled by an older, larger boy and struck his head on the hardwood floor, losing consciousness and suffering a concussion and related injuries.

42. Had Defendant exercised reasonable care—by maintaining adequate staffing, enforcing its own supervision representations, actively supervising the children, and promptly stopping the dangerous tackling game—the incident and resulting injury to L.J. would not have occurred. See Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 523 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts law requiring showing that negligence was a substantial contributing factor).

43. The harm suffered by L.J. was the kind of harm that made Defendant’s negligence unreasonable and was within the scope of the foreseeable risks created by Defendant’s failure to supervise and control the children in its care. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 640–41 (1996).

#### D. Damages

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, L.J. sustained a concussion and associated physical injuries, including but not limited to head trauma, headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and cognitive and emotional symptoms.

45. L.J. has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, and emotional distress, including anxiety, fear, and distress related to physical activity and group play.

46. L.J. missed several days of school and has suffered a loss of enjoyment of life and normal childhood activities, including physical play, recreational sports, and social activities, during his period of recovery.

47. Plaintiff, as L.J.’s parent and guardian, has incurred and become legally obligated to pay medical expenses for L.J.’s care and treatment in an approximate amount of $5,000 to date, and may incur additional reasonable medical expenses in the future. See G.L. c. 231, § 85L (parent’s right to recover for medical expenses of minor child).

48. Plaintiff is entitled to recover on behalf of L.J. for all past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, and to recover for all reasonable and necessary medical expenses incurred as a result of Defendant’s negligence. See McGuiggan v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 398 Mass. 152, 157–58 (1986); G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest).

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, any comparative negligence of third parties does not bar recovery by Plaintiff and L.J. but may only, if proven, proportionally reduce damages; Plaintiff asserts that neither he nor L.J. was negligent and that any negligence lies solely with Defendant and unknown third‑party minors under Defendant’s supervision.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Lucas Johnson, as parent and next friend of his minor son L.J., respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Brockton Community Center, and award:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:

   1. Compensation for L.J.’s past and future physical pain and suffering;  
   2. Compensation for L.J.’s past and future emotional distress and mental anguish;  
   3. Compensation for L.J.’s loss of enjoyment of life and normal childhood activities;  
   4. Reimbursement of all reasonable and necessary medical expenses incurred to date, presently estimated at approximately $5,000; and  
   5. Reimbursement for all future reasonable and necessary medical, therapeutic, and related expenses arising from L.J.’s injuries;

B. Prejudgment interest on all monetary damages as allowed by G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law;

C. Costs of this action as permitted by G.L. c. 261 and the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure;

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

### VI. JURY DEMAND

Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60 and Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LUCAS JOHNSON,  
as parent and next friend of his minor son, L.J.,  

By his own signature pro se,
