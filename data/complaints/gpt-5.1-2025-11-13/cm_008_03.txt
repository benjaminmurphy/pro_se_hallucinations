LAURA MARTINEZ,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  

MARK JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No.: __________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20;  
Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 7 & 15)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Defendant” or “Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Sofia Johnson.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, upon information and belief, resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father of the minor child, Sofia Johnson.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child subject to the existing custody judgment of this Court:

   - Sofia Johnson, female, age 10.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and its general equity powers with respect to custody, visitation, and the care of minor children.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior judgment regarding custody and parenting time was issued by this Court, the child resides within the jurisdiction of this Court, and all relevant events have occurred within this Commonwealth. See M.G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6; M.G.L. c. 223, § 1.

6. The Court retains continuing jurisdiction to modify prior custody and parenting-time orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

7. On or about May 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment (the “Judgment”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time of the minor child, Sofia Johnson.

8. Under the Judgment:

   a. The parties share joint legal custody of the minor child, Sofia;

   b. The Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, is the primary residential parent of Sofia;

   c. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, has substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sunday nights; and

   d. The parties are required to cooperate in good faith on school-related matters and to keep each other informed regarding the child’s education and related issues.

9. At the time the Judgment entered on May 15, 2022, the minor child, Sofia, was performing well in school. Her grades and standardized test scores were adequate or better, she had no significant issues with truancy, and the parties’ shared legal custody arrangement appeared workable regarding educational decisions.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare, education, and best interests of the child, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions.

11. Over the past year, during the Defendant’s weekend parenting time (including Sunday-night overnights), the Defendant has routinely and repeatedly kept Sofia home from school on Mondays, characterizing these absences as “mental health days.”

12. The Defendant has done so without:

   a. Obtaining or providing medical or mental-health documentation supporting the need for such recurring absences;

   b. Informing or consulting the Plaintiff in a meaningful, timely manner regarding such absences; and

   c. Considering the cumulative impact of these “mental health days” on Sofia’s attendance record, truancy status, and academic progress.

13. These Monday absences are not supported by doctor’s notes, therapeutic recommendations, or any formal evaluation indicating that repeated school absences are necessary or appropriate for Sofia’s health.

14. As a direct result of these repeated unexcused or inadequately excused absences, the school has issued truancy or attendance warnings concerning Sofia.

15. During the same period, Sofia’s grades and test scores have declined, and the school’s concerns about her attendance have increased.

16. Additionally, the Defendant has consistently refused or failed to bring Sofia to scheduled tutoring or academic-support sessions when those sessions fall during his weekend or Sunday-night parenting time.

17. The tutoring and supplemental educational services were intended to address Sofia’s academic difficulties and to remedy or mitigate the impact of her increased absences and declining performance.

18. The Defendant’s pattern of:

   a. Withholding Sofia from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time; and

   b. Refusing to transport her to scheduled tutoring sessions during his parenting time,

   has directly undermined Sofia’s education, attendance record, and academic progress.

19. The Defendant’s conduct constitutes a failure to comply with the spirit and letter of the Judgment requiring the parties to cooperate on school matters and to act consistently with Sofia’s educational best interests.

20. The deterioration in Sofia’s academic performance, increased truancy concerns, and the Defendant’s disregard of school attendance and tutoring obligations were not present or reasonably foreseeable at the time of the May 15, 2022 Judgment.

21. These changes are substantial, continuing, and directly affect Sofia’s present and future educational well‑being, thereby constituting a material change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification under Massachusetts law.

### V. APPLICABLE LAW

22. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and, in cases involving unmarried parents, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20), a Probate and Family Court may modify any prior judgment relative to the custody and maintenance of minor children upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.

23. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the “best interests of the child” is the paramount consideration in all custody and visitation determinations and modifications. See, e.g.:

   a. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   b. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   c. Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000);  
   d. Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

24. The Court may modify existing orders where there is a material change since the prior judgment that affects the welfare of the child, including changes related to the parents’ ability or willingness to meet the child’s educational needs. See:

   a. Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (modification warranted where circumstances affecting child’s welfare materially changed);  
   b. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (modification appropriate when necessary to serve child’s best interests in light of changed circumstances);  
   c. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (change in circumstances bearing on child’s welfare justifies modification).

25. Where joint legal custody exists, courts expect a minimum level of cooperation and communication between parents, particularly in major areas such as education. A breakdown in the parents’ ability to cooperate on important matters may warrant modifying legal custody or decision‑making authority. See:

   a. Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (joint legal custody inappropriate where parents unable to cooperate or communicate effectively regarding child’s needs);  
   b. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (shared decision‑making requires ability to cooperate);  
   c. Custody of Two Minors, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 553 (1985) (court may adjust custody where joint arrangement not serving best interests due to parental conflict).

26. The Court has broad equitable authority to fashion parenting-time and decision‑making orders designed to protect the child’s welfare and ensure that the child’s educational and developmental needs are met, including by granting one parent final decision‑making authority in specified domains (such as education) where the other parent’s conduct is contrary to the child’s best interests. See:

   a. Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981) (broad equitable powers to safeguard child’s welfare);  
   b. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (court may allocate decision‑making authority in best interests of child);  
   c. Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 736 (1981) (court may make any order in equity to protect child’s welfare).

27. Regular school attendance and support for a child’s education are integral components of the child’s best interests. Parental conduct that causes unnecessary absenteeism, truancy warnings, and declining academic performance constitutes a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and may justify a modification of custodial and parenting-time arrangements in order to protect the child’s educational interests. See, e.g., Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 243–44.

### VI. FACTUAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

28. After the May 15, 2022 Judgment, Sofia’s school attendance during the Defendant’s parenting time has become irregular due to the Defendant’s unilateral decisions to keep her home on Mondays following his weekend overnights.

29. The Defendant characterizes these absences as needed “mental health days,” yet he has not arranged for or provided consistent mental‑health treatment, evaluation, or documentation supporting the necessity of recurring absences from school.

30. The Plaintiff has not agreed to these repeated absences, and they were not jointly decided under the parties’ shared legal custody; rather, they have been imposed unilaterally by the Defendant during his parenting time.

31. These repeated Monday absences have caused Sofia to miss instructional time, fall behind in school, and accumulate an attendance record that has triggered truancy or attendance warnings from the school.

32. In response to Sofia’s declining performance and attendance, tutoring and/or supplemental educational services were arranged to support Sofia’s academic needs.

33. The Defendant has refused or failed to bring Sofia to tutoring sessions that fall during his weekend or Sunday‑night parenting time, thereby preventing her from accessing the very academic support intended to correct the problems caused in part by her absences.

34. The Defendant’s refusal to ensure Sofia’s attendance at tutoring and his continued practice of keeping her home from school has exacerbated the decline in her grades and test scores.

35. The Defendant’s behavior undermines the shared legal‑custody arrangement as it relates to educational decision making, because he is not cooperating with the Plaintiff or with the school to support consistent attendance and academic improvement.

36. The Plaintiff, as primary residential parent, has attempted to maintain consistent attendance and follow school recommendations during her custodial time; the pattern of absences and missed tutoring is largely, if not exclusively, associated with the Defendant’s parenting time and his unilateral decisions.

37. The combination of:

   a. Repeated unexcused or inadequately excused Monday absences during the Defendant’s parenting time;  
   b. Truancy warnings and other attendance‑related concerns from the school;  
   c. Declining grades and test scores; and  
   d. The Defendant’s refusal to transport Sofia to tutoring during his parenting time,

   constitutes a substantial and continuing material change in circumstances since the May 15, 2022 Judgment.

38. This change directly impacts Sofia’s educational welfare, emotional stability related to school performance, and long‑term academic prospects, thereby requiring the Court’s intervention.

39. The requested modification, described below, is narrowly tailored to address these educational and attendance‑related issues and to serve Sofia’s best interests by ensuring consistent school attendance and access to tutoring and academic support.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

40. The Plaintiff does not seek to eliminate the Defendant’s relationship with Sofia or to terminate his parenting time, but rather to modify the existing Judgment in a manner that:

   a. Prioritizes Sofia’s education and school attendance;  
   b. Ensures compliance with school policies and recommendations; and  
   c. Provides clear authority for educational decisions when the parents disagree.

41. In light of the material change in circumstances and the governing legal standards, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the May 15, 2022 Judgment as follows:

   **A. Educational Decision‑Making Authority**

   42. That the Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, be granted final decision‑making authority with respect to all education‑related matters for Sofia, including but not limited to:

       a. School attendance and excused absences;  
       b. Participation in tutoring, academic‑support, or remedial programs;  
       c. Homework routines and compliance;  
       d. Educational testing and services; and  
       e. Any changes in school placement or educational programming.

   43. That the existing joint legal custody arrangement be modified solely to the extent necessary to grant the Plaintiff final authority in the area of education, while the parties otherwise continue to share legal custody in other domains (e.g., routine medical and religious decisions), unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

   **B. Parenting Time / Sunday‑Night Overnights**

   44. In the alternative, or in addition, that the Court adjust the Defendant’s parenting time on school nights to prevent further disruption to Sofia’s school attendance, specifically by:

       a. Eliminating or reducing the Defendant’s Sunday‑night overnights during the school year and ordering that Sofia be returned to the Plaintiff no later than Sunday at a time reasonably calculated to ensure Sofia’s readiness for school on Monday; or  

       b. Conditioning continuation of Sunday‑night overnights on strict compliance with school‑attendance requirements, such that Sofia must attend school on Monday unless both parents agree in writing, or the Plaintiff as educational decision‑maker authorizes, an absence consistent with medical or educational recommendations.

   **C. Tutoring and Educational Support**

   45. That the Court order both parties to comply with any agreed‑upon or school‑recommended tutoring or academic‑support schedule, and specifically require that:

       a. The Defendant must ensure Sofia’s attendance at all tutoring or academic‑support sessions that occur during his parenting time; and  

       b. The Defendant shall not unreasonably withhold consent or cooperation with such educational services.

   **D. Cooperation and Communication**

   46. That the Court reaffirm and clarify that the parties shall share school information and cooperate in good faith, and that:

       a. Each parent shall promptly provide the other with notice of any school communications concerning attendance, grades, testing, or disciplinary issues;  

       b. Each parent shall ensure that the school has up‑to‑date contact information for both parents; and  

       c. The Defendant shall not unilaterally remove Sofia from school or keep her home on school days, except in cases of genuine illness or emergency consistent with school policy and, if reasonably possible, after consultation with the Plaintiff.

   **E. Any Further Appropriate Relief**

   47. That the Court enter any further orders, conditions, or modifications it deems just and proper to safeguard Sofia’s educational welfare, ensure compliance with school‑attendance laws and policies, and promote her best interests.

### VIII. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

48. The requested modifications are in Sofia’s best interests because they:

   a. Promote consistent school attendance;  
   b. Address and seek to reverse the decline in her academic performance;  
   c. Ensure she receives tutoring and other educational supports; and  
   d. Reduce conflict and uncertainty regarding school attendance decisions.

49. Granting the Plaintiff final educational decision‑making authority, and/or adjusting the Defendant’s Sunday‑night overnights and school‑night parenting time, will provide clear structure and accountability, thereby strengthening Sofia’s educational stability without unnecessarily impairing her relationship with the Defendant.

50. The requested relief is the least‑intrusive modification sufficient to protect Sofia’s educational interests and is fully consistent with Massachusetts law, which places the child’s best interests above all other considerations in custody and parenting‑time matters. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843.

### IX. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 15, 2022 Judgment concerning custody and parenting time for the minor child, Sofia Johnson;

2. Find that the existing provisions regarding joint legal custody and the Defendant’s weekend (including Sunday‑night) parenting time no longer adequately protect Sofia’s best interests with respect to her education and school attendance;

3. Modify the Judgment to grant the Plaintiff final decision‑making authority regarding all education‑related issues for Sofia, including school attendance, tutoring, and other academic support, while otherwise leaving joint legal custody intact unless the Court determines further modification is necessary;

4. Alternatively, and/or in addition, modify the Defendant’s parenting time, particularly his Sunday‑night school‑night overnights, so as to:

   a. Eliminate or reduce Sunday‑night overnights during the school year; and/or  
   b. Condition any continued Sunday‑night overnights on strict compliance with school‑attendance requirements and the Plaintiff’s final educational decision‑making authority;

5. Order both parties to ensure Sofia’s regular attendance at school in accordance with school policy and state attendance requirements, and prohibit unilateral “mental health day” absences by the Defendant that are not medically or educationally justified and not authorized pursuant to the modified orders;

6. Order both parties to ensure that Sofia regularly attends all agreed‑upon or school‑recommended tutoring and academic‑support sessions, with specific obligations imposed on the Defendant during his parenting time;

7. Order the parties to cooperate in good faith and to share all information concerning Sofia’s education, including attendance notices, report cards, progress reports, standardized‑test results, and communications from the school;

8. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child, Sofia Johnson.
