While the opinion holds that serious interference with tenants\u2019 use of common areas can breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment, it does so based on landlord inaction in controlling premises, not on failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. Thus, it does not frame the breach as arising from non-habitability, and the proposition overstates the link between habitability and quiet enjoyment in this case.",

While the bulk of the opinion focuses on the measure of habitability damages, the court cites Simon v. Solomon as authority and explicitly notes that the judge found a breach of quiet enjoyment in this context, which aligns with the proposition that severe habitability defects substantially interfering with use and enjoyment can constitute a breach of the covenant.

Thus it cannot be cited as direct authority for the particular proposition about water leaks and mold, even though its general reasoning about substantial interference might be analogized.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable.

Because of this interference, and based on his reading of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to an additional [damages award]."

It does not articulate or apply a legal standard that links a landlord\u2019s persistent failure to repair serious defects after notice specifically to \"unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment\" under \u00a7 14.

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe judge\u2019s award based on a wilful or knowing violation is supported by evidence that the previous tenant, who moved out in 1979, was unsuccessful in obtaining repairs and that some of the problems (leaks) had persisted for three and a half years and continued to the time of the trial in 1983. While each violation may not in itself have been wilful, e.g., the inadequate door, we think that where, as here, there were many continuing violations, some major and some minor, their cumulative effect on habitability can be considered by the trial judge in determining whether Brown\u2019s behavior was wilful.\u201d"
