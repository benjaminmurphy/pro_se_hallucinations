------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Williams (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Laura Smith (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Williams is an individual residing at 45 Elm Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Laura Smith is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and lessor of the residential premises located at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), including Plaintiff’s basement apartment.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing residential tenancies and the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19B and applicable provisions governing civil actions within the jurisdictional amount of the Boston Municipal Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, because the Premises are located in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and the cause of action arose in this Division. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 2, 8.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a basement apartment at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, with Defendant as landlord.

7. The tenancy has been continuous from March 1, 2022, through the present, with monthly rent of $1,200 payable to Defendant.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord and person in control of the Premises, including Plaintiff’s unit, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 111.

9. The rental unit is a basement apartment in a residential building, and Plaintiff has occupied it as his primary residence.

10. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff experienced a temporary financial hardship due to medical bills and paid his rent approximately two weeks late.

11. Plaintiff subsequently paid the full October rent, including any late fees assessed by Defendant, and cured any default.

12. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water seeping through an exterior basement wall of his apartment whenever it rained heavily.

13. The water infiltration was recurrent, occurring during periods of heavy rain, and caused dampness, wet flooring, and elevated moisture levels in the basement apartment.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the water intrusion in or about November 2025 by text message, informing Defendant that water was seeping in through the wall and that the condition needed to be repaired.

15. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but failed to make timely or effective repairs.

16. After several weeks passed with no repairs or remediation, Plaintiff, concerned about health, safety, and property damage, contacted the City of Boston’s appropriate housing or inspection department to report the conditions.

17. City inspectors visited the Premises, inspected Plaintiff’s unit, and, upon information and belief, identified the water intrusion problem and other housing and/or sanitary code violations.

18. The water infiltration and dampness damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including but not limited to a rug and a bookshelf that were against or near the affected wall, resulting in approximately $400 in property damage.

19. Because of the persistent dampness and excessive moisture, Plaintiff has been required to run a dehumidifier constantly to reduce moisture in the apartment, increasing Plaintiff’s electric utility costs.

20. The water intrusion, dampness, and code violations have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the apartment as a safe and habitable dwelling.

21. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints and the City’s involvement, Defendant has failed and continues to fail to properly repair the water intrusion and remediate the resulting conditions.

22. Following Plaintiff’s complaint to the City and the inspection, Defendant began referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

23. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that she does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 (Plaintiff understands his lease to run through March of each year and that it is set to end around March 1, 2026).

24. Defendant has stated that her reason for non‑renewal is Plaintiff’s prior late payment of October 2025 rent, notwithstanding that Plaintiff cured any default and that the non‑renewal notice came only after Plaintiff contacted the City regarding code and habitability problems.

25. The timing and circumstances of Defendant’s threatened non‑renewal are closely linked to Plaintiff’s exercise of his rights to complain to public authorities regarding substandard conditions at the Premises.

26. At all relevant times, Defendant had a duty to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including requirements relating to water penetration, moisture, structural integrity, and habitability.

27. The presence of water seepage through the basement wall, chronic dampness, and resulting damage indicate a significant defect affecting the habitability and safety of the apartment, violating the State Sanitary Code and implied warranty of habitability.

28. The ongoing water intrusion and Defendant’s failure to address it substantially impaired Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises by exposing him to excessive moisture, property damage, potential mold and health risks, and the burden of continuously running a dehumidifier.

29. Plaintiff has experienced stress, anxiety, and loss of peace and comfort in his home as a result of Defendant’s failure to remediate the conditions and her characterization of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” after he sought help from city authorities.

30. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, the water problem remains unresolved, and Defendant has not fully corrected the conditions found by the City.

31. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct, including: (a) property damage of approximately $400; (b) increased electricity costs for the dehumidifier; and (c) loss of use and enjoyment of the premises due to unsafe and unhealthy conditions and the threat of non‑renewal in apparent retaliation for Plaintiff’s exercise of his legal rights.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

32. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–31 above as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts contains a covenant that the tenant shall have the quiet enjoyment of the premises.

34. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from serious interference with the use, occupancy, and beneficial enjoyment of the leased premises caused by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s control. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

36. A landlord’s failure to correct substantial code violations and conditions threatening health or safety can constitute an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (persistent code violations and failure to repair can breach quiet enjoyment); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983–84 (1982).

37. Serious water infiltration, chronic dampness, and conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code, particularly when left unremedied after notice, constitute a substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 787–88 (1994); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977).

38. The landlord’s knowledge of a defective condition and failure to take appropriate action can give rise to liability for breach of quiet enjoyment where the condition substantially impairs the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See, e.g., Aubin v. Susi, 331 Mass. 140, 142–43 (1954); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).

39. Pursuant to G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., landlords must keep residential premises in compliance with minimum standards of fitness for human habitation. Failure to comply may also support a claim for interference with quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 201–02 (1979).

40. After Plaintiff notified Defendant in November 2025 of the water seepage through the basement wall, Defendant had actual notice of the defective and unsafe condition affecting Plaintiff’s unit.

41. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to timely and effectively repair the water intrusion and correct the resulting dampness and code violations.

42. The City’s inspection, following Plaintiff’s complaint, further confirmed serious conditions at the Premises, putting Defendant unequivocally on notice of violations and required repairs.

43. Defendant’s failure to correct the water intrusion and associated conditions within a reasonable time, despite notice, constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

44. The water seepage and resulting dampness caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, worth approximately $400, and forced Plaintiff to incur additional electricity charges to run a dehumidifier continuously.

45. The chronic damp conditions, property damage, and increased utility expenses materially impaired Plaintiff’s comfort, health, and safety in the apartment, depriving Plaintiff of the beneficial use of the premises.

46. Defendant’s statements labeling Plaintiff a “problem tenant” after he exercised his rights to call the City, and her threatened refusal to renew Plaintiff’s lease for reasons pretextual to his protected activity, further interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment by creating an atmosphere of intimidation and insecurity in his home.

47. Although Plaintiff was briefly late in paying October 2025 rent, he cured that late payment in full, including late fees, and at no time did Plaintiff’s conduct justify the creation or continuation of defective and unsafe conditions in the apartment.

48. The covenant of quiet enjoyment exists independently of the tenant’s obligation to pay rent; a tenant’s minor or cured default does not excuse a landlord from complying with G.L. c. 186, § 14 and maintaining habitable conditions. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973).

49. Defendant’s course of conduct—allowing persistent water intrusion, failing to remedy sanitary and building code violations after notice, causing property damage and increased utility costs, and threatening non‑renewal of Plaintiff’s tenancy after he complained to municipal authorities—constitutes an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Property damage in the approximate amount of $400;  
    b. Increased electricity costs associated with operating a dehumidifier to mitigate dampness; and  
    c. Loss of use and enjoyment of the premises, stress, discomfort, and diminished quality of life due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions and the reasonable fear of retaliatory non‑renewal.

51. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

52. Plaintiff seeks recovery of his actual damages and statutory damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount not less than three months’ rent ($1,200 × 3 = $3,600), plus costs and such other relief as is just.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14;

   1. Approximately $400 for damage to Plaintiff’s rug, bookshelf, and other personal property; and  
   2. Additional electricity costs incurred due to the continuous use of a dehumidifier, in an amount to be proven at trial;

C. An order that Defendant promptly repair and remediate the water intrusion, dampness, and all related housing and sanitary code violations affecting Plaintiff’s unit, in accordance with applicable law and regulations (including 105 C.M.R. 410.000), or such injunctive or equitable relief as the Court deems appropriate to restore Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment;

D. Reasonable costs of this action, as allowed by law, including, to the extent recoverable, any reasonable attorney’s fees should Plaintiff later retain counsel, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;

E. Such additional and further relief as the Court deems just, proper, and equitable.
