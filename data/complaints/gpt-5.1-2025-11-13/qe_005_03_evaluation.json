Our opinions concerning a constructive eviction by an alleged breach of an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment sometimes have stated that the landlord must perform some act with the intent of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment and occupation of the whole or part of the leased premises."

The discussion emphasizes both omissions (inaction) and conduct that \u2018directly or indirectly\u2019 interferes with quiet enjoyment, matching the proposition that liability arises when a landlord allows substantially interfering conditions to persist. The holding narrows liability to at least negligent conduct but clearly affirms that negligent action or inaction that allows such conditions can breach the covenant.",

L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, could be imposed only if it were proved that a landlord was reckless\u2026 and we concluded that negligent conduct, conduct involving \u2018some degree of fault,\u2019 by a landlord could support the imposition of liability under \u00a7 14. We noted that a landlord\u2019s failure \u2018to repair defects of which he has notice in leased premises is an omission which frequently has been deemed to violate \u00a7 14.\u2019\u201d}"

The court explicitly rejects the landlord\u2019s argument that it should not be held responsible for actions of third parties beyond its control, emphasizing that the flooding was a preventable situation the landlord had a duty to prevent. The holding thus supports the proposition that Massachusetts law does not require the landlord personally to create the noise/condition or physically enter, so long as there is substantial interference resulting from the landlord\u2019s failure to control foreseeable and controllable third\u2011party conduct.",

In this concurring/dissenting opinion, Justice Quirico expressly agrees that the court is abandoning the older caveat-emptor rule and recognizing a new implied obligation tied to minimum standards of habitability, even though he disputes how broadly the majority defines that warranty.

As the first step in the removal of the roadblock discussed above I would reverse that rule and hold instead (a) that the various statutes, ordinances, by-laws, rules, regulations and codes prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards...."
