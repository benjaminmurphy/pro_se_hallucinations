---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Apartment”) with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment from May 1, 2022, through the present and has paid monthly rent of $1,500 to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant has been responsible for maintaining the common areas of the building at 15 Mystic Street, including but not limited to the main entry door, hallways, and basement, in a condition that is safe, secure, and compliant with Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.

10. The building at 15 Mystic Street has a main entry door that provides access from the street to the interior common areas and to the individual residential units (the “Main Entry Door”).

11. For at least approximately the last two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the lock and latch mechanism on the Main Entry Door have been broken such that the door does not latch properly and can be pushed open by any person without a key or lawful access.

12. As a result of the broken lock and latch on the Main Entry Door, unauthorized persons have been able to enter the building freely, without being invited or permitted by any tenant.

13. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the broken lock and defective condition of the Main Entry Door approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, in or about early October 2025.

14. Plaintiff informed Defendant that the Main Entry Door did not latch and that anyone could push it open, thereby compromising the security of the entire building and the safety and privacy of the tenants.

15. Defendant acknowledged the problem and told Plaintiff that he would fix the Main Entry Door lock, but he did not do so.

16. After Defendant failed to repair the lock, Plaintiff reminded Defendant at least twice more that the Main Entry Door remained broken and unsecured.

17. Despite these repeated notices and reminders, Defendant has failed and refused to repair or replace the lock and latch mechanism on the Main Entry Door, and the door remains in a defective and unsecured condition.

18. In or about November 2025, while the Main Entry Door lock remained broken and the building was unsecured, an unknown individual or individuals entered the building and went through mail and packages left in the common hallway.

19. During this incident, multiple tenants in the building had packages stolen from the hallway, including Plaintiff.

20. Plaintiff had at least one package stolen from the building’s common hallway during this incident, with a value of approximately $120.

21. Around this same period, Plaintiff also began to observe evidence that an unknown person had been sleeping in the basement of the building, including but not necessarily limited to bedding or personal items indicative of someone staying overnight.

22. The presence of an unauthorized person sleeping in the basement, combined with the theft of mail and packages and the continuing inability of the Main Entry Door to latch and lock properly, has caused Plaintiff to reasonably fear for her personal safety, the security of her property, and the privacy of her home.

23. Because Defendant failed to repair the Main Entry Door lock and secure the building, Plaintiff felt compelled to spend her own money to attempt to protect herself and her property.

24. Specifically, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for her own apartment door and purchased and installed a better deadbolt for her apartment door, at a combined cost of approximately $200.

25. Plaintiff made these expenditures reasonably and foreseeably as a direct result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the Main Entry Door in a safe and secure condition and his failure to remedy the defective condition after having been notified multiple times.

26. Plaintiff also suffered the loss of the stolen package with a value of approximately $120, which occurred because unauthorized persons were able to enter the building through the defective Main Entry Door.

27. Plaintiff’s total out-of-pocket monetary losses to date, directly attributable to Defendant’s conduct and the defective Main Entry Door, are approximately $320 (the $120 stolen package and the $200 security-related purchases).

28. In addition to these monetary losses, Plaintiff has experienced substantial fear, anxiety, stress, and loss of peace of mind due to the lack of building security, the theft, and the evidence of unauthorized persons entering and remaining in the building.

29. Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her Apartment as a safe, private, and secure home, as contemplated by her tenancy and the covenant of quiet enjoyment, has been substantially and materially impaired by Defendant’s conduct and omissions.

30. Plaintiff again complained to Defendant about the security issues, the theft, and the evidence of someone sleeping in the basement, and she expressed that she felt unsafe.

31. In response, Defendant told Plaintiff that she was “overreacting” and asserted that the neighborhood was safe, dismissing her concerns and failing to take reasonable steps to secure the building.

32. At no time did Defendant take prompt, reasonable, or effective action to repair the Main Entry Door lock or otherwise secure the building after learning of the defective condition and the security incidents.

33. Defendant’s failure to repair the lock and secure the Main Entry Door persists through the date of this Complaint, despite repeated notice and the foreseeability of thefts, intrusions, and threats to tenant safety and security.

34. Defendant’s ongoing inaction, after actual notice of the defective and insecure condition of the Main Entry Door and the harm it was causing, constitutes at least negligent, and, upon information and belief, reckless and willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.

35. The defective and unsecured condition of the Main Entry Door also constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code requirement that the owner maintain the building and its facilities in good repair and in a safe condition for occupants. See 105 CMR 410.750; 105 CMR 410.351 & 410.750 (obligation to maintain structural elements and facilities).

36. The defective and unsecured condition of the Main Entry Door further constitutes a condition that materially impairs the health, safety, and wellbeing of tenants within the meaning of G.L. c. 111, § 127A and related provisions concerning the enforcement of the State Sanitary Code.

37. Defendant’s failure to remedy the defective condition, even after repeated notice and actual incidents of theft and unauthorized entry, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her Apartment and the common areas appurtenant to her tenancy.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

38. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–37 as if fully set forth herein.

39. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects a tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s authority. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

40. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

41. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord’s acts or omissions have the natural and probable consequence of interfering substantially with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718.

42. A landlord may be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where, after receiving notice, the landlord unreasonably fails to correct unsafe or unsanitary conditions, or conditions that impair the security, privacy, and habitability of the premises. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–05; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

43. Landlord liability for breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 does not require proof of malice; it is sufficient that the landlord intentionally engaged in the acts or omissions that caused the interference, and that the resulting interference was a natural and probable consequence of those acts or omissions. See Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983–84 (1982); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

44. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a duty under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law to refrain from directly or indirectly interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment and appurtenant common areas.

45. Defendant had actual notice, for at least approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, that the Main Entry Door lock and latch were broken and that the building was not properly secured.

46. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that a broken and unsecured Main Entry Door would naturally and probably result in unauthorized entry by third parties, theft of tenants’ property, intrusion into tenants’ privacy and security, and a substantial interference with tenants’ use and enjoyment of their homes.

47. Despite this knowledge and repeated complaints from Plaintiff, Defendant failed and refused to repair the Main Entry Door lock or otherwise take reasonable steps to secure the building.

48. Defendant’s failure to act continued even after unauthorized individuals entered the building, rummaged through mail, and stole packages; and even after there was evidence that someone was sleeping in the basement, further demonstrating the foreseeability and reality of the security risks.

49. Defendant’s continuing inaction, after repeated notice and after actual harm had occurred, constitutes at least negligent, and upon information and belief, reckless and willful disregard of Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.

50. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to remedy known conditions that substantially impair a tenant’s safety, security, or habitability can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–05 (landlord’s failure to correct flooding conditions after notice); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994) (conditions violating sanitary code can support quiet enjoyment claim); Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85 (failure to take reasonable protective measures after notice of dangerous conditions).

51. The State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., requires landlords to maintain residential premises, including means of egress and building components, in good repair and in a safe, sanitary condition. Violations of the Sanitary Code that substantially impair health or safety can support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 789–90; Hilder v. St. Peter, 144 Vt. 150, 157–58 (1984) (persuasive authority cited by Massachusetts courts regarding habitability and quiet enjoyment).

52. The defective and unsecured condition of the Main Entry Door, and Defendant’s ongoing failure to repair it, constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment, including but not limited to:
    a. Enabling unauthorized persons to gain access to the building;  
    b. Resulting in the theft of Plaintiff’s package and other tenants’ property;  
    c. Causing a reasonable fear for Plaintiff’s personal safety and security;  
    d. Compelling Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses to secure her own door; and  
    e. Depriving Plaintiff of the sense of privacy, safety, and security that is a fundamental aspect of residential quiet enjoyment.

53. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, viewed in their entirety, have interfered with Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy her Apartment as a safe, secure, and habitable home and have deprived her of the benefit of her bargain as a tenant. See Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85; Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

54. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:
    a. The loss of property from the stolen package worth approximately $120;  
    b. The cost of purchasing and installing a security camera and improved deadbolt, totaling approximately $200; and  
    c. Non-economic damages including fear, anxiety, stress, loss of sleep, and loss of peace of mind associated with feeling unsafe in her home and the building’s common areas.

55. Plaintiff’s actual out-of-pocket monetary damages are at least $320, and she has also suffered consequential damages in the form of emotional distress and loss of use and enjoyment, which are compensable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–05 (allowing recovery for emotional distress in quiet enjoyment context).

56. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either (a) her actual and consequential damages or (b) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, along with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

57. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500. Three months’ rent is therefore $4,500.

58. Plaintiff is thus entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 to recover at least $4,500 in statutory damages (three months’ rent), plus costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees (if she later retains counsel or incurs fees) or, in the alternative, her actual and consequential damages to be determined at trial if greater.

59. Defendant’s conduct also reflects a disregard for Plaintiff’s rights protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14, justifying the statutory remedy of at least three months’ rent. See Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983–84 (quiet enjoyment damages are mandatory upon a finding of violation); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 400–01 (1982) (statutory remedies designed to deter landlord misconduct).

60. To the extent that the Court finds Defendant’s conduct to be willful or knowing, such a finding further supports imposing the full remedies available under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and affirming the seriousness of the interference with Plaintiff’s rights.
