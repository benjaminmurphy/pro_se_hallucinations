PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BRISTOL COUNTY  

-----------------------------------------------  
Jessica Thompson,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  
                                                     Docket No. ___________  

Mark Rivera,  
 Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), self‑represented, and complains of the Defendant, Mark Rivera (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this is a request to modify an existing custody and parenting‑time order of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court regarding a minor child who is domiciled in Massachusetts.

2. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody judgment was entered in this Court and the minor child resides within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 215, § 3.

3. On or about May 15, 2019, this Court entered a judgment (the “2019 Judgment”) establishing custody and parenting time with respect to the parties’ minor child, Ethan Thompson, born __________, age 8 (the “Child”).

4. The 2019 Judgment granted Mother primary physical custody of the Child, and granted Father three brief visits during the week and Sunday afternoon visitation, with no overnights, based in substantial part on Father’s then‑limited and unsuitable housing (a single room in a shared apartment with roommates and no appropriate sleeping space for a young child).

5. The 2019 Judgment remains in effect, and no subsequent modification order has been issued.

### II. PARTIES

6. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an adult individual, the Mother of the Child, and resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She has been the primary physical custodian of the Child since the 2019 Judgment. Mother’s contact information is:  
   Phone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com.

7. Defendant, Mark Rivera, is an adult individual, the Father of the Child, and, upon information and belief, resides in or near Bristol County, Massachusetts.

8. Paternity and/or parentage of the Child has been established and is not in dispute.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting‑time order upon a showing of (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (b) that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

10. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances relating to: (a) the Child’s age, developmental stage, and school schedule; (b) Father’s housing situation and ability to provide suitable overnight accommodations; and (c) the practical functioning of the existing parenting‑time schedule in light of these changes.

11. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, the Child was approximately three (3) years old, not yet in full‑time elementary school. The Court then fashioned a schedule of short, daytime and early evening visits with no overnights, which was tailored to the Child’s very young age and Father’s housing limitations.

12. The Child is now eight (8) years old and is enrolled in full‑time school. His developmental, emotional, and social needs differ significantly from those at age three. Courts recognize that a child’s maturation and changing developmental needs can constitute a material change warranting review of prior custody or parenting‑time orders. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

13. Father’s housing circumstances have materially improved since the 2019 Judgment. At that time, Father lived only in a single room in a shared apartment with roommates and had “no real space for a child,” a circumstance that directly contributed to the denial of overnights.

14. Father now resides in his own, separate apartment where the Child has his own bedroom and appropriate sleeping space. This represents a substantial and material improvement in stability, privacy, and suitability for overnights, directly addressing the safety and appropriateness concerns that existed in 2019.

15. The prior lack of safe and appropriate overnight accommodations was a central factual predicate for the Court’s decision to prohibit overnight parenting time with Father. The correction of that predicate is, in itself, a material change in circumstances. See *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (material change where factual assumptions underlying original order no longer apply); *Kindregan & Inker, Family Law and Practice* § 45:8 (4th ed.) (changes to housing and stability may support modification of parenting schedules).

16. The current parenting‑time arrangement, involving three short visits during the week plus a Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights, requires the Child to be shuttled repeatedly between households during school nights for relatively brief periods of time.

17. This pattern of frequent, short transitions is now disruptive to the Child’s school schedule, homework, extracurricular activities, and bedtime routines, and has become increasingly burdensome as his academic workload and need for consistent routines have grown.

18. Mother and Father both experience the current schedule as exhausting and impractical. They must coordinate frequent transportation for brief visits that do not provide the Child with meaningful, settled time in either household on school evenings.

19. The Child has repeatedly expressed a desire to have “actual sleepovers” at Father’s apartment, where he now has his own room. While a child’s preference is not controlling, the Court may consider the reasonable preferences of a child of sufficient age and maturity as one factor in the best‑interests analysis. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 272 (2001); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

20. The change in Father’s housing and capacity to provide safe, stable overnight care—combined with the Child’s older age, school obligations, and stated desire for overnights—constitute a material and substantial change from the circumstances that existed at the time of the 2019 Judgment.

21. Mother is not seeking a change in legal custody (decision‑making authority) unless the Court deems it appropriate. The principal change requested is a restructuring of the parenting‑time/physical custody arrangement, specifically to provide for regular, scheduled overnight parenting time with Father and to eliminate or reduce the current pattern of multiple, short, non‑overnight visits during school nights.

22. The parties are in agreement that the schedule should be changed in some fashion to better meet the Child’s present‑day needs. Their shared recognition that the old schedule is no longer workable further evidences a material change in circumstances. See *Cooper v. Cooper*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 51 (1997) (parents’ changed circumstances and recognition of impracticality of prior order supported modification).

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. Any modification of custody or parenting time must serve the Child’s best interests. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006); G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

24. In determining best interests, Massachusetts courts consider, among other factors: the child’s age and developmental needs; the quality of the child’s relationship with each parent; each parent’s ability to provide for the child’s emotional, educational, and physical needs; the stability of each home; and the desirability of maintaining continuity and minimizing disruptive transitions. See *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003).

25. The Child has a loving relationship with both parents. The 2019 Judgment already recognized Father as an important presence in the Child’s life by providing frequent parenting time, though without overnights due largely to housing limitations.

26. Father’s current housing now provides the Child with a dedicated bedroom and appropriate living environment, which supports overnights and a more normalized parent‑child relationship with both households being able to function as “home” for the Child.

27. The Child’s full‑time school attendance and increased academic responsibilities mean he benefits from fewer, more predictable transitions and longer, more settled periods with each parent, rather than frequent, short visits on school nights that interfere with homework and bedtime.

28. Allowing Father regular overnight parenting time would reduce the Child’s total number of transitions back and forth between homes, provide more consistent routines, and enable Father to be involved in the Child’s evening and morning routines, including homework, dinner, and preparation for school.

29. Increased overnight parenting time with Father would strengthen the Child’s bond with Father and foster continuity of relationship, which is an important best‑interests consideration. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998) (emphasizing importance of preserving strong parent‑child relationships consistent with child’s welfare).

30. A modified schedule that includes overnights with Father can be structured around the Child’s school schedule to ensure that his educational needs, homework, and rest are fully met, consistent with the Court’s obligation to prioritize the Child’s welfare over the convenience of either parent. See *Murphy v. Murphy*, 380 Mass. 454, 461 (1980).

31. The requested modification does not seek to marginalize or reduce either parent’s role; instead, it seeks to adjust the parenting plan to the Child’s current age, school obligations, and Father’s improved circumstances, promoting stability and healthy relationships with both parents.

32. The modification sought aligns with the public policy of the Commonwealth favoring active participation of both fit parents in the upbringing of their children, so long as it is consistent with the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 710–11; *Mason*, 447 Mass. at 184.

33. Considering the totality of the circumstances, including the Child’s age, schooling, stated desire for sleepovers, Father’s substantially improved housing, and the practical burdens of the current schedule, a modified parenting‑time arrangement providing for regular overnights with Father is in the Child’s best interests.

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

34. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, the Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children” upon a showing of changed circumstances and the best interests of the child.

35. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification would promote the welfare of the child, the Court not only may, but should, modify existing custody or parenting‑time orders. See, e.g.:

   a. *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (material change and children’s welfare justify modification);  
   b. *Cooper v. Cooper*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 51 (1997) (impracticality of former order and changed facts supported modification of custody/visitation);  
   c. *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript) (modification proper upon changed circumstances affecting children);  
   d. *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998) (modification guided by best interests of child and need to preserve beneficial parental relationships);  
   e. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best‑interests standard controls modification of custody/parenting orders);  
   f. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (reaffirming best‑interests analysis for parenting‑time changes);  
   g. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best‑interests and meaningful parental relationships central to custody/relocation analysis);  
   h. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (material change where basis of original order no longer exists);  
   i. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (child’s preferences and changed circumstances relevant to best‑interests determination);  
   j. *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (discussing child‑focused best‑interests analysis and stability).

36. Here, the specific factual assumptions underlying the 2019 Judgment—particularly Father’s lack of a suitable, separate apartment and the Child’s very young age and pre‑school status—have materially changed. The Child is now in a very different stage of development and education, and Father can now provide a separate bedroom and appropriate environment for overnight parenting time.

37. Under the above authorities and G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, these facts constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances sufficient to justify modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

38. Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2019 Judgment to update the parenting‑time/physical custody schedule so that it is better aligned with the Child’s age, school schedule, and Father’s current capacity to provide appropriate overnight care.

39. Without limiting the Court’s discretion to fashion an appropriate parenting plan, Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Maintain Mother as the primary physical custodian of the Child, unless the Court determines otherwise is in the Child’s best interests;  

   b. Grant Father regular, scheduled overnight parenting time with the Child, to replace the current pattern of three short weekday visits and Sunday afternoon visits with no overnights;  

   c. Establish a consistent parenting‑time schedule that may include, for example, one or more weekday overnights and/or alternate weekend overnights with Father, or such other arrangement as the Court deems in the Child’s best interests;  

   d. Reduce or eliminate the burdensome pattern of multiple, brief, non‑overnight visits during school nights, in favor of fewer transitions and longer, more stable periods with each parent;  

   e. Clarify transportation responsibilities, pick‑up and drop‑off times, and any other logistics necessary to implement the modified schedule; and  

   f. Enter any further orders, including related adjustments to child support or allocation of expenses, as may be required by law and consistent with the Child’s best interests, upon the filing of any necessary financial statements and/or child support guidelines worksheets.

40. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the Child’s current needs, Father’s substantially improved housing situation, and the burdens imposed by the existing schedule, and is consistent with the governing statutes and case law requiring that custody and parenting‑time orders reflect present‑day realities and the Child’s best interests.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2019 custody and parenting‑time judgment;

2. Find that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Thompson, that the existing parenting‑time/physical custody provisions be modified;

3. Modify the 2019 Judgment to provide Father with regular, scheduled overnight parenting time, in place of the existing schedule of three short weekday visits and Sunday afternoon visits with no overnights;

4. Establish a clear, detailed parenting‑time schedule that takes into account the Child’s school schedule, homework, and need for consistent routines, and minimizes unnecessary transitions between households;

5. Maintain Mother as primary physical custodian, unless the Court determines an alternative arrangement is in the Child’s best interests;

6. Issue any necessary orders concerning transportation, exchanges, communication, and related logistics to implement the modified parenting‑time schedule;

7. Issue any additional and related orders regarding child support and allocation of expenses, if and as appropriate under the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines and applicable law, upon submission of the parties’ financial statements;

8. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

Respectfully submitted,

Jessica Thompson
