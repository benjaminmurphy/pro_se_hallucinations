COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
____________________________________  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Carter (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She may be contacted for purposes of this proceeding at telephone number (617) 555‑0123 and email address: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, James Carter (“Father”), is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in or near Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

3. The parties are the parents of the following minor child:  
   - Sophie Carter, date of birth: __________, age 12 (hereinafter, “Sophie” or “the child”).

4. On or about May 10, 2018, the Bristol Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment (or Order) regarding legal and physical custody and parenting time for Sophie (the “2018 Custody Judgment”).

5. Pursuant to the 2018 Custody Judgment, the parties were awarded shared legal custody of Sophie and equal (50/50) physical custody on an alternating week-on/week-off basis, which was appropriate at the time when both parties lived nearby and were in good health.

6. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters involving custody and parenting time for Sophie pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and applicable common law, because the original custody order was issued by this Court, the child has resided in Massachusetts for more than six months, and Massachusetts is Sophie’s home state within the meaning of the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and the UCCJEA, G.L. c. 209B.

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS – MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. For several years after entry of the 2018 Custody Judgment, the 50/50 alternating week custodial arrangement functioned well. Both parents were able to meet Sophie’s day‑to‑day needs, and Sophie was able to maintain stable routines in both homes.

8. More recently, Father has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition. This diagnosis, and Father’s resulting physical limitations, have substantially changed the circumstances that existed at the time of the 2018 Custody Judgment.

9. As a result of this medical condition, Father has experienced repeated falls in his home, including but not limited to falls occurring during times when Sophie has been present.

10. Father’s treating medical providers have advised him that, due to his condition, he should not be alone with Sophie in settings where there are stairs or in other situations requiring quick physical responses to maintain safety.

11. Despite these medical recommendations and his own diminished physical abilities, Father insists on strictly maintaining the existing 50/50 alternating‑weeks schedule without modification.

12. During Father’s parenting time, Sophie has, on multiple occasions, been asked or expected to assist Father with tasks that are physically demanding, intimate, or otherwise inappropriate for a twelve‑year‑old child, including but not limited to:
   a. Assisting Father to move from a wheelchair to the bed or other furniture; and  
   b. Bringing Father medication, food, or personal items in circumstances in which Father’s safety and well‑being depend on immediate help.

13. These circumstances place Sophie in the role of caregiver to her disabled parent, creating age‑inappropriate responsibilities and emotional stress for a child of twelve and potentially exposing her to dangerous situations if Father falls or is otherwise unable to respond physically.

14. The combination of Father’s progressive neurological condition, his history of falls, the medical advice that he not be alone with Sophie in certain situations, and his continued insistence on exercising full 50/50 physical custody despite these limitations, together constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2018 Custody Judgment.

15. Mother does not seek to undermine Sophie’s relationship with Father and acknowledges the importance of that relationship. Instead, Mother seeks a modification of physical custody and parenting time so that:
   a. Sophie’s physical safety and emotional well‑being are adequately protected;  
   b. Sophie is not placed in the role of primary caregiver to Father; and  
   c. Father’s parenting time is structured in a way that realistically reflects his current and anticipated physical abilities and any reasonable accommodations or supports available to him.

16. Mother is able and willing to provide primary day‑to‑day care for Sophie, including ensuring that Sophie maintains consistent school attendance, medical care, extracurricular participation, and age‑appropriate routines in a safe and stable environment.

17. The current arrangement, if left unchanged, risks placing Sophie in unsafe physical situations where Father may not be able to respond quickly enough to protect her from harm, especially in the presence of stairs, fall risks, or medical emergencies.

18. The existing 50/50 physical custody schedule was premised on both parties being physically able to independently meet the child’s daily and emergency needs; that premise is no longer true, and maintaining the same schedule without adjustment is no longer in Sophie’s best interests.

19. It is in Sophie’s best interests that Mother be designated as Sophie’s primary physical custodian, with Father’s parenting time modified to reflect:
   a. Father’s current medical limitations;  
   b. Any reliable in‑home support or assistance Father can secure during his parenting time; and  
   c. A schedule that allows frequent and meaningful contact between Sophie and Father while ensuring Sophie’s safety and preventing her from serving as Father’s de facto caregiver.

### III. APPLICABLE LAW

20. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting‑time order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order, and (2) that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

21. The paramount concern of the Court in any matter affecting custody or parenting time is the best interests of the child. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

22. A material change in circumstances justifying modification may include changes in a parent’s physical or mental health, changes in a parent’s capacity to care for the child safely, or other developments that materially impact the child’s welfare. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845–46; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981) (rescript); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191–92 (1998).

23. The Court has broad discretion to modify physical custody and parenting schedules to protect a child’s physical safety and emotional well‑being when changed circumstances warrant such relief. See Hernandez v. Branciforte, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 219–20 (2002); Adoption of Garret, 92 Mass. App. Ct. 664, 671–72 (2018).

24. In evaluating the child’s best interests, the Court may consider, among other things, the child’s age and developmental needs; the physical and mental health of each parent; each parent’s capacity to provide for the child’s needs; the degree of stability each household can offer; and whether the custodial arrangement will place unreasonable emotional or caretaking burdens on the child. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 848–49; Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610, 618–19 (1986); Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575, 580–81 (2007).

25. Massachusetts courts recognize that exposing a child to unsafe conditions or placing inappropriate caretaking responsibilities on a child can be inconsistent with the child’s best interests. See Adoption of Carla, 416 Mass. 510, 514–16 (1993) (emphasizing the need for a safe environment and freedom from undue adult burdens); Adoption of Mary, 414 Mass. 705, 711–12 (1993) (considering the impact of parental limitations on the child’s welfare).

26. While disability in and of itself does not disqualify a parent from having custody or parenting time, the Court must carefully examine the practical impact of a parent’s condition on the child’s safety and welfare. See Adoption of Gregory, 434 Mass. 117, 125–26 (2001); see also Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998) (courts must evaluate actual ability to care for the child, not stereotypes or assumptions).

27. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, the Court may make such orders as are necessary to protect the welfare of the child, including designating a primary physical custodian and restructuring parenting time to reflect the circumstances of the parties and the child’s best interests.

28. Consistent with these statutes and cases—including but not limited to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); Hernandez v. Branciforte, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 212 (2002); Adoption of Carla, 416 Mass. 510 (1993); Adoption of Mary, 414 Mass. 705 (1993); Adoption of Gregory, 434 Mass. 117 (2001); and Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)—the substantial change in Father’s health and capacities since the 2018 Custody Judgment, and the consequent risks and burdens placed upon Sophie, warrant a modification of the existing order.

### IV. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 10, 2018 Custody Judgment, specifically including (but not limited to) Father’s progressive neurological condition, his resulting physical limitations and history of falls, the medical recommendations limiting the circumstances under which he should be alone with Sophie, and the age‑inappropriate caregiving responsibilities that have been placed on Sophie.

B. Find and rule that it is in the best interests of Sophie Carter that the existing physical custody and parenting‑time provisions be modified.

C. Award Mother primary physical custody of Sophie, with the parties continuing to share legal custody unless and until the Court determines otherwise.

D. Establish a parenting‑time schedule for Father that provides for frequent and meaningful contact with Sophie, but that:
   1. Ensures Sophie’s physical safety, including reasonable safety provisions around stairs, mobility, and medical emergencies;
   2. Does not place Sophie in the role of primary caregiver for Father or otherwise assign her adult caretaking responsibilities; and
   3. Takes into account Father’s current and reasonably anticipated future medical condition, any reliable in‑home supports or assistance available to him, and Sophie’s school and activity schedule.

E. Order such additional or modified provisions as the Court deems appropriate to protect Sophie’s best interests, which may include, without limitation:
   1. Conditions on Father’s parenting time related to supervision, support persons, or safety measures in the home;  
   2. Reasonable notice and information‑sharing regarding Father’s medical condition to the extent it substantially affects Sophie’s safety or care; and  
   3. Any necessary adjustments to holidays, vacations, and transportation arrangements.

F. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
EMILY CARTER,  
By her own signature,
