v.  

MICHAEL SMITH,  
    Defendant.  


COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)


NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Michael Smith (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Smith is an individual who owns and/or manages the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws c. 186 and c. 239 and is responsible for compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A, the Worcester District Court has jurisdiction over this matter because the Premises are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the claims arose within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

7. Venue is proper in this Court because the rental property that is the subject of this action is located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”), owned and/or controlled by Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has, at all relevant times, paid monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant.

10. Plaintiff has at all relevant times used the Premises as her primary residence and has kept the Apartment in a clean, orderly, and sanitary condition.

11. Approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint (around early September 2025), Plaintiff began to notice mouse droppings in her kitchen, including on countertops, near food storage areas, and on the floor.

12. The presence of mouse droppings is evidence of ongoing rodent infestation, which constitutes a condition that may endanger or materially impair the health, safety, or well-being of the occupants in violation of the State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and 410.600.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mouse problem and the repeated presence of droppings.

14. After Plaintiff’s initial complaint, Defendant placed a few traps in the Apartment.

15. The traps caught approximately two mice, but Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings on a regular basis thereafter.

16. Plaintiff again informed Defendant that the mouse droppings and infestation were ongoing and had not been resolved.

17. Defendant responded by telling Plaintiff that the presence of mice was “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff needed to “keep [her] kitchen cleaner,” implying that the infestation was due to Plaintiff’s housekeeping rather than a defect in the Premises or the building.

18. Plaintiff maintains, and hereby alleges, that she keeps the kitchen and the entire Apartment clean, sanitary, and in good order, and that the infestation is not the result of any failure on her part.

19. Defendant thereafter hired an exterminator for a single visit to the building.

20. During that visit, the exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building likely needed more comprehensive pest control treatment to address the ongoing rodent problem.

21. Plaintiff relayed this information to Defendant, including the exterminator’s opinion that a more thorough, building-wide treatment was necessary to remedy the infestation.

22. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for the more comprehensive treatment recommended by the exterminator, stating that such treatment was “overkill” and “too expensive.”

23. As a result, only minimal pest control was performed, and the underlying rodent problem has persisted.

24. Plaintiff has continued to find fresh mouse droppings in her kitchen on a regular basis, including weekly occurrences, for approximately three months.

25. The continued presence of mice and their droppings in Plaintiff’s food-preparation and eating area has rendered the kitchen unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for its ordinary and intended use.

26. Plaintiff has been forced to throw away food items that may have been contaminated by the presence of mice and droppings, including boxed and bagged goods that were not in fully sealed containers.

27. Plaintiff estimates, and hereby alleges, that she has had to discard approximately $200.00 worth of food over the course of the last several months because of the infestation.

28. To protect her food from further contamination, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers and other supplies to store all food items in sealed, hard containers, at a cost of approximately $80.00.

29. Plaintiff’s total direct, out-of-pocket damages related to the rodent infestation, including discarded food and storage containers, are approximately $280.00.

30. In addition to these monetary losses, Plaintiff has suffered substantial discomfort, anxiety, and distress associated with the ongoing infestation.

31. Plaintiff has been, and remains, constantly anxious and fearful about cooking or eating in her own kitchen due to the presence of mouse droppings and the risk of contamination and disease.

32. The ongoing rodent problem, and Defendant’s failure to adequately address it, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly the kitchen and food-preparation areas.

33. Plaintiff’s Apartment is part of a multi-unit residential building for which Defendant is responsible for maintaining common structural elements, including walls, floors, and utilities, in compliance with relevant housing and sanitary codes.

34. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and 410.600, the owner of a residential building is responsible for exterminating rodents and maintaining the building free from infestation when the infestation is not due to the fault or neglect of the occupant.

35. At all relevant times, Plaintiff acted reasonably and diligently in notifying Defendant of the infestation and requesting relief.

36. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation, understood that the problem was ongoing, and was informed of a professional exterminator’s recommendation that more extensive measures were required.

37. Notwithstanding such notice and opportunity to cure, Defendant failed and refused to undertake the level of pest control necessary to eradicate the infestation and restore the Premises to a sanitary and habitable condition.

38. Defendant’s failure to take adequate remedial action was willful, or at minimum, in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and well-being.

39. Defendant’s inaction, even after being informed that the Premises required more comprehensive treatment, constitutes at least negligent, and more properly intentional or reckless, disregard of Plaintiff’s right to a habitable dwelling and to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her kitchen and portions of the Apartment, has incurred monetary losses, and has endured substantial inconvenience, annoyance, and distress.

### IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

41. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied warranty of habitability and an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 186, § 14.

42. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., adopted pursuant to G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, establishes minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, including requirements related to vermin and rodent control.

43. 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and 410.600 require the owner of a dwelling to maintain the premises free from rodent infestation and to exterminate rodents when necessary, except where the infestation is caused by the occupant’s failure to maintain the dwelling in a clean and sanitary condition.

44. Violations of the State Sanitary Code can constitute evidence of a breach of the warranty of habitability and can support a finding of a substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–200; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 201–02 (1979).

45. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

46. A landlord’s failure to correct serious conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code, after notice, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994).

47. The covenant of quiet enjoyment focuses on whether the landlord engaged in acts or omissions that substantially interfered with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, and does not require physical entry or eviction. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

48. Where a landlord’s conduct or failure to act, after notice, foreseeably and substantially impairs the character and value of the leased premises for the tenant’s purposes, the landlord has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716–18; Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997).

49. Under G.L. c. 239, § 8A, sanitary code violations and conditions materially affecting the health or safety of tenants may support claims and defenses, including breach of warranty and quiet enjoyment; the same conditions may form the basis of affirmative relief where, as here, a tenant seeks damages for loss of use and enjoyment.

50. In addition, Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that persistent infestations and unsanitary conditions—such as rodents, insects, and other vermin—may constitute substantial interferences with quiet enjoyment and support recovery under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (rodent infestation and code violations); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994) (habitability and code compliance as to vermin).

51. Under Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), a landlord’s willful or reckless failure to remedy serious conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of their home can give rise to liability for not only economic loss, but also for emotional distress and discomfort caused by the breach of quiet enjoyment.

52. By statute, a tenant prevailing on a claim under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is entitled to actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979).

53. Plaintiff invokes these authorities and the protections of G.L. c. 186, § 14, the State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000), G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, G.L. c. 239, § 8A, and relevant case law, including but not limited to:  

   a. Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973);  
   b. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979);  
   c. Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979);  
   d. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977);  
   e. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982);  
   f. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  
   g. Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782 (1994);  
   h. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997);  
   i. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); and  
   j. G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; and G.L. c. 239, § 8A.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

54. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 53 as if fully set forth herein.

55. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful residential tenant in possession of the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

56. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

57. Defendant had actual notice of the mouse infestation and the repeated presence of mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen and food-preparation areas.

58. Defendant was informed, both by Plaintiff and by the exterminator, that the infestation persisted and that more comprehensive pest control measures were necessary to address the problem.

59. Despite having such notice and a reasonable opportunity to correct the conditions, Defendant failed and refused to implement the level of extermination and building-wide measures required to eradicate the rodent infestation.

60. Defendant’s acts and omissions, including but not limited to:

   a. Minimizing the seriousness of the infestation by stating it was “normal for older buildings”;  
   b. Blaming Plaintiff’s housekeeping despite Plaintiff’s maintenance of a clean and sanitary home;  
   c. Limiting extermination efforts to a single, inadequate visit; and  
   d. Refusing to authorize or pay for the more comprehensive treatment recommended by a professional exterminator,

   together constitute an intentional, or at least reckless, interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.

61. The persistent rodent infestation and the presence of mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen and food areas constitute conditions that are unfit for human habitation and violate the State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and 410.600.

62. Defendant’s failure to correct these conditions, after repeated notice, caused a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly the kitchen and associated living areas.

63. The interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment was substantial, continuous over a period of months, and reasonably foreseeable by Defendant once Defendant was informed that the infestation was ongoing and more extensive treatment was required.

64. Under the standards articulated in Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), and their progeny, Defendant’s failure to remedy the rodent infestation after notice constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

65. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff suffered:

   a. Out-of-pocket damages, including approximately $200.00 in spoiled/discarded food and $80.00 in costs of plastic storage containers and related supplies;  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of the kitchen and associated living space in the Premises; and  
   c. Significant discomfort, annoyance, anxiety, and emotional distress due to the persistent, unsanitary, and unhealthy conditions.

66. Plaintiff’s actual monetary damages are approximately $280.00, exclusive of non-economic damages associated with discomfort, loss of use, and emotional distress.

67. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

68. Plaintiff’s rent is $1,200.00 per month; three months’ rent therefore equals $3,600.00.

69. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to at least $3,600.00 in statutory damages (three months’ rent), plus any additional actual and consequential damages proved at trial, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount equal to the greater of:

   1. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:  
      a. Approximately $280.00 in out-of-pocket expenditures for spoiled/discarded food and the purchase of storage containers;  
      b. Damages for loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Premises; and  
      c. Damages for discomfort, annoyance, and emotional distress caused by Defendant’s breach of quiet enjoyment;  

   OR

   2. Three months’ rent, in the amount of $3,600.00;

C. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14 (recognizing that Plaintiff is presently self-represented, but seeking such fees if counsel is later obtained);

D. An order that Defendant promptly and fully abate the rodent infestation in the Premises and building in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, including any comprehensive extermination necessary to eradicate the infestation and prevent its recurrence;

E. Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.
