-----------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Smith (“Plaintiff”), for his Complaint against Defendant Emily Johnson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an individual residing at 24 Chelsea Street, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant Emily Johnson is an individual, on information and belief residing in Massachusetts, who is the owner and/or lessor of the residential premises located at 24 Chelsea Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”), and at all relevant times has acted as Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Chelsea District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A, and 21, which confer jurisdiction on the District Court over civil actions in which the damages do not exceed the statutory limits.

4. Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the cause of action arose within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment at 24 Chelsea Street, Chelsea, MA 02150 (the “Apartment”).

6. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Apartment as his primary residence since on or about June 1, 2022.

7. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500, which he has paid or stood ready, willing, and able to pay to Defendant as required under the tenancy.

8. Defendant, as landlord, is responsible for maintaining the common areas of the building, including the main entry door and its lock, in a condition that is safe and compliant with applicable law. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 186, § 15F; G.L. c. 143; G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.750–410.754 (minimum standards of fitness for human habitation and safe egress/common areas).

9. The main entry door to the building at 24 Chelsea Street has a broken or defective lock. The door does not latch properly and can be pushed open by anyone from the outside without a key or proper access.

10. The broken entry door lock allows unrestricted access by unknown persons to the interior common areas of the building, including the hallways, mail area, and basement.

11. Approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff personally notified Defendant that the main entry door lock was broken and not latching properly.

12. Defendant acknowledged the problem and told Plaintiff that she would have it repaired.

13. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to repair the lock within a reasonable time and failed to take any effective action to secure the main entry door.

14. Plaintiff subsequently reminded Defendant at least two additional times that the lock remained broken and that the building was not secure.

15. On each occasion, Defendant failed and refused to make timely and adequate repairs to the lock or to otherwise secure the building’s main entry door.

16. Last month, while the main entry door lock remained broken, one or more unknown persons entered the building without authorization and went through the mail in the common hallway.

17. During that incident, packages belonging to several tenants, including Plaintiff, were stolen from the common area.

18. Plaintiff had a package stolen with a value of approximately $120.

19. In addition, Plaintiff has discovered evidence suggesting that an unauthorized person has been sleeping or residing in the building’s basement, including personal items and other indications of overnight presence.

20. The presence of unauthorized individuals in the building, including in the basement and near the mail and entryway, has caused Plaintiff to fear for his safety and security and has interfered with his ability to peacefully and securely enjoy his home.

21. As a result of Defendant’s failure to maintain a secure building entry, Plaintiff experienced loss of property (the $120 package), anxiety, distress, and disruption of his use and enjoyment of the Apartment and the common areas.

22. Because Defendant failed to remedy the dangerous and insecure condition of the entry door lock despite multiple notices, Plaintiff felt compelled to purchase additional security measures for his own protection.

23. Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for his own apartment door, as well as a better deadbolt lock for his apartment door, at a combined cost of approximately $200.

24. Plaintiff would not have needed to incur those expenses if Defendant had fulfilled her legal obligations to keep the building’s main entry secure and safe from unauthorized intruders.

25. When Plaintiff raised his concerns about the security of the building and the incidents of theft and unauthorized entry, Defendant responded that Plaintiff was “overreacting” and asserted that the neighborhood was safe.

26. Defendant nevertheless did not repair the main entry door lock in a timely manner and did not take reasonable steps to secure the building despite knowing that (a) the lock was not functioning, and (b) there had been actual thefts and suspected unauthorized occupation of the basement.

27. Defendant’s failure to repair the entry door lock and to secure the building is a failure to maintain the common areas in a condition suitable for residential occupancy and violates her statutory and common-law obligations as a landlord.

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, inconvenience, loss of property, emotional distress, and substantial interference with the use and quiet enjoyment of his Apartment.

29. Plaintiff reasonably believes that he has suffered at least $320 in out-of-pocket and related damages (including the value of the stolen package and the cost of additional security measures), plus loss of rental value and other consequential damages.

30. All events and omissions complained of herein occurred within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

31. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that any landlord who does so “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

33. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in residential tenancies and prohibits a landlord from substantially interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See, e.g.:  
   a. *Williams v. Seder*, 306 Mass. 134 (1940);  
   b. *Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp.*, 340 Mass. 124 (1959);  
   c. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997);  
   d. *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985);  
   e. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is violated when the landlord, or someone for whose conduct the landlord is responsible, engages in acts or omissions that cause a serious and substantial interference with the tenant’s use of the premises, including failure to remedy conditions that threaten the tenant’s safety or security. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04; *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

35. The duty to maintain common areas in a reasonably safe condition is part of the landlord’s obligations under Massachusetts law, and failure to maintain such areas can constitute an interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Crowell v. McCaffrey*, 377 Mass. 443, 451–52 (1979); *Banaghan v. Dewey*, 340 Mass. 73, 80–81 (1959); see also G.L. c. 186, §§ 14, 15F; 105 C.M.R. 410.750–410.754.

36. The implied warranty of habitability, recognized in *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and codified in part in G.L. c. 111, § 127A and the State Sanitary Code, reinforces the requirement that landlords maintain residential premises, including common areas, in a condition fit for human habitation and reasonably secure against foreseeable harms.

37. The broken and non-functioning main entry door lock at 24 Chelsea Street created a condition that allowed unauthorized individuals to enter the building and the common areas freely, including the hallways and basement.

38. Defendant knew or should have known that a broken entry door lock posed a foreseeable risk of theft, trespass, and intrusion, and that such a condition would materially interfere with tenants’ sense of safety and security in their homes.

39. Plaintiff provided Defendant with actual notice of the defective condition of the main entry door lock on at least three occasions over a period of approximately two months.

40. Despite having such notice, Defendant unreasonably failed and refused to make timely and adequate repairs, or to take other reasonable measures, to secure the building’s main entrance.

41. During the time that Defendant failed to act, unauthorized persons entered the building and stole mail and packages from the common hallway, including Plaintiff’s package worth approximately $120.

42. Plaintiff also discovered evidence that an unknown person was sleeping or residing in the basement, further heightening the security concerns and interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

43. Defendant’s failure to remedy the insecure condition of the building’s entry despite repeated notice, coupled with her dismissive characterization of Plaintiff’s concerns as “overreacting,” demonstrates a disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and of her obligations under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

44. The resulting presence of unauthorized persons, theft of Plaintiff’s property, and fear and anxiety experienced by Plaintiff constitute a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of his Apartment.

45. Massachusetts courts have recognized that disturbances affecting the safety, health, or security of tenants—such as persistent unsafe or unsanitary conditions, or the landlord’s failure to address them after notice—can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (sewage backups and landlord’s failure to correct them); *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–52 (unsafe conditions and landlord’s neglect); *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 977–78.

46. The landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 may be based on negligent omissions as well as intentional acts, so long as the landlord’s conduct results in a serious interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03; *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

47. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, as described above, constitute at least negligent, and in the circumstances unreasonable, interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment and the building’s common areas.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. The value of the stolen package (approximately $120);  
   b. The cost of installing additional security measures (security camera and upgraded deadbolt) in the amount of approximately $200;  
   c. Loss of rental value and diminished enjoyment of the premises due to persistent insecurity and fear; and  
   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, and disruption of Plaintiff’s peaceful use of his home.

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for the greater of (a) Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, or (b) three months’ rent, plus costs of the action and a reasonable attorney’s fee.

50. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500; three months’ rent would therefore equal $4,500.

51. Plaintiff seeks an award under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than his actual and consequential damages, and reserves the right to seek up to the statutory minimum of three months’ rent, subject to the Court’s determination of the appropriate remedy.

52. Plaintiff also seeks reasonable costs of this action as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14. Although Plaintiff is currently self-represented, he reserves the right to seek attorney’s fees should he later retain counsel.
