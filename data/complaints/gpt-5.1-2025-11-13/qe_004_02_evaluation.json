The court notes that \u00a7 14 codified common-law rights under the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, but it does not itself formulate the broader proposition that every residential lease in Massachusetts contains this implied covenant. Thus, while contextually consistent with the proposition, the case is not direct authority for that specific statement.",

The opinion also explains that the triple\u2011rent remedy is an alternative minimum recovery when actual damages are low, and confirms that attorney\u2019s fees are awarded under \u00a7 14, which aligns with the proposition about the measure of damages and fees (even though Simon involved a represented tenant).",

See Darmetko v. Boston Hous.
