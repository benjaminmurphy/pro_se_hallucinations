      "proposition": "Massachusetts courts have recognized that evidence of substance abuse or impaired parenting abilities may warrant modification of custody or parenting time to protect a child\u2019s welfare. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595\u201396; Care & Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704, 711\u201313 (1984); Adoption of Quentin, 424 Mass. 882, 886\u201387 (1997).",

      "support_reasoning": "Adoption of Quentin is a termination-of-parental-rights/adoption case focused on parental unfitness, not on modification of custody or parenting time based specifically on substance abuse or impaired parenting in an ongoing custody regime. While the court notes, among many factors, that the father used public assistance to purchase drugs and that the mother lacked capacity to care for the children, it does so in the context of dispensing with consent to adoption, not modifying existing custody or visitation arrangements. The case therefore does not squarely support the narrower proposition about modification of custody or parenting time due to substance abuse or impaired parenting abilities.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We conclude that there was adequate evidence to support the findings that: the parents maintained an unsafe and unsanitary home and failed to take steps to correct these conditions; the parents lived an itinerant lifestyle which was harmful to the children; they neglected the emotional well-being of the children; the father never displayed a long-term commitment to stay with the family; the father used the public assistance funds to purchase drugs; the mother lacked the ability to protect the children from the father\u2019s harmful conduct; and the mother lacked the capacity to deal with the needs of the children. Taken together, these facts provide clear and convincing evidence that both parents were unfit."
