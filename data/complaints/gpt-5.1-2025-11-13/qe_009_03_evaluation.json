It also discusses, in depth, the recognition of an implied warranty of habitability as a landlord\u2011tenant doctrine. While this section is not the majority holding and focuses on tenants as defendants in summary process rather than as plaintiffs, it does support the general proposition that warranty of habitability and \u00a7 8A are separate, available landlord\u2011tenant remedies distinct from a covenant of quiet enjoyment claim under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.",
