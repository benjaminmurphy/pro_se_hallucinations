v.  

Michael Harrington,  
 Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No.: __________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  
------------------------------------------------------

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Harrington (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the biological mother of the minor child, Sophie Harrington (date of birth not stated here to protect privacy; age 10).

2. The Defendant, Michael Harrington, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the biological father of the minor child, Sophie Harrington.

3. The parties are the parents and legal custodians of the minor child, Sophie Harrington (“the Child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of judgments concerning custody and visitation), G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (modifications respecting custody and visitation of children born to unmarried parents, to the extent applicable), and G.L. c. 215, § 6 (general equity jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court).

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody and parenting-time orders concerning the Child were issued by this Court, and the child and at least one parent reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.

6. The Court retains continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time matters concerning the Child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law, including *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

7. On or about April 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the parties’ minor child (the “2018 Judgment”).

8. Under the 2018 Judgment, primary physical residence of the Child was awarded to Father, with Mother having limited weekend parenting time and one weeknight dinner visit per week.

9. The 2018 Judgment and parenting schedule were based on the circumstances existing at that time, including:

   a. Mother’s enrollment in graduate school and related academic demands;  
   b. Mother’s then-residence in a small studio apartment, which did not reasonably accommodate overnights; and  
   c. Mother’s inflexible and demanding schedule that limited her ability to exercise more extensive parenting time.

10. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there have been significant and material changes in circumstances affecting the welfare of the Child, such that modification of the existing parenting plan is required in order to serve the Child’s best interests.

### IV. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD

11. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment; and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 149–50 (2015); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 182–83 (2006).

12. In determining the best interests of a child, the Court considers all relevant factors, including the child’s age, developmental needs, the stability and quality of each parent’s home environment, the child’s relationship with each parent, and the willingness of each parent to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

13. The preferences and expressed wishes of a mature child are factors that the Court may consider in assessing the child’s best interests, although such preferences are not controlling. *See* *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); *Jones v. Jones*, 349 Mass. 259, 264 (1965).

14. Where material changes in the parents’ circumstances alter their respective abilities to meet the child’s needs or to provide an appropriate home and schedule, modification of prior custodial arrangements may be warranted. *See* *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 370–72 (1981); *Champion v. Champion*, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 219–21 (2002); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981).

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

15. Since the entry of the 2018 Judgment, Mother’s circumstances have significantly and materially changed in ways that directly affect the Child’s welfare and best interests.

16. Mother has completed her graduate education and is no longer a student. She is now employed in a stable job with regular, predictable, and “normal” work hours, which has substantially increased her availability to care for the Child.

17. Mother now resides in a two-bedroom apartment within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which provides a safe, stable, and appropriate home environment for the Child.

18. The Child has her own dedicated bedroom in Mother’s home, with appropriate furnishings, privacy, and personal belongings, indicating that Mother can comfortably and appropriately accommodate the Child for increased overnights and extended parenting time.

19. Mother’s living and employment situation have stabilized significantly since 2018, and the conditions that led the Court to limit Mother’s parenting time at that time (graduate school demands, a small studio apartment, and lack of flexibility) no longer exist.

20. The Child is now ten (10) years old, significantly older and more mature than she was at the time of the 2018 Judgment (when she was approximately four (4) years old). Her developmental needs, routine, school responsibilities, and emotional capacities have all changed.

21. As children mature, their needs and capacities evolve, and prior parenting plans may no longer be appropriate or optimal. Massachusetts courts recognize that changes in a child’s age and developmental stage, coupled with changed parental circumstances, can constitute a material change warranting modification. *See* *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–84.

22. Over the past several years, Mother and the Child have developed and strengthened a very close, loving, and supportive relationship. The Child is emotionally bonded with Mother and has expressed a strong desire to spend more time and more overnights in Mother’s home.

23. The Child is currently in therapy. According to the Child’s therapist, the Child feels guilty when she must leave Mother’s home after short visits and is distressed by the limited nature of her time with Mother.

24. The Child has communicated, through her therapist and otherwise, that she would like increased overnights and a more balanced schedule between her parents.

25. The Child has written a letter to the Court (or “to the judge”), expressing her wish for more overnights and more extensive time with Mother, consistent with her emotional needs and her close relationship with Mother.

26. The expressed desires of an older, school-age child, such as this ten-year-old Child, are properly considered by the Court as one factor in determining best interests. *See* *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96; *Jones v. Jones*, 349 Mass. at 264.

27. Father has refused to meaningfully discuss any adjustment or modification of the current parenting schedule, despite the significant changes in Mother’s circumstances and the Child’s stated wishes.

28. When the Child attempts to raise the subject of spending more time at Mother’s home, Father becomes angry, which reportedly causes the Child emotional distress and feelings of guilt and conflict about her desire for additional time with Mother.

29. Father’s unwillingness to consider reasonable, child-focused adjustments to the parenting plan, and his angry reaction when the Child expresses her wishes, may negatively affect the Child’s emotional well-being and places the Child in the middle of parental conflict.

30. Massachusetts law encourages parents to foster and support the child’s relationship with the other parent; failure or refusal to do so is relevant to the best-interests analysis. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–84; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

31. The combination of:  
   a. Mother’s completion of graduate school;  
   b. Mother’s acquisition of stable, full-time employment with predictable hours;  
   c. Mother’s move to a two-bedroom apartment where the Child has her own bedroom;  
   d. The strengthening of the Child’s emotional bond with Mother;  
   e. The Child’s increased age and maturity;  
   f. The Child’s expressed desire for more overnights and extended time with Mother; and  
   g. Father’s refusal to consider any modification of the parenting schedule and his negative reaction when the Child raises the issue,  

   constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2018 Judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 149–50, and *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. at 370–72.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

32. Any modification of custody or parenting time must serve the Child’s best interests. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. at 225–26.

33. Mother is presently able to offer the Child a safe, stable, and nurturing home environment, with a dedicated bedroom, regular routine, and emotional support.

34. Mother’s current employment and housing situation enable her to provide consistent daily care, support homework and school activities, and maintain stable routines, which are critical to a ten-year-old child’s development.

35. Increasing the Child’s overnights and weekend time with Mother would promote and strengthen the Child’s emotional security, attachment, and sense of being fully connected to both parents.

36. A more balanced and developmentally appropriate schedule will better reflect the Child’s age, needs, and wishes and will reduce the distress she currently reports when she must leave Mother’s home after short visits.

37. Allowing the Child meaningful, regular, and extended time in Mother’s home is consistent with the policy of Massachusetts law to ensure that children have “frequent and continuing contact with both parents” where appropriate. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711.

38. Expanding Mother’s parenting time would not undermine the Child’s relationship with Father and can be structured to preserve the Child’s stability in school, extracurricular activities, and community.

39. To the extent necessary, the Child’s therapist and/or a guardian ad litem may assist the Court in evaluating the Child’s needs and wishes, consistent with *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96, and *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. at 225–26.

40. The requested modification seeks to adjust only the parenting schedule and related provisions so that it better reflects current circumstances and the Child’s best interests; it does not seek to sever or impair Father’s relationship with the Child.

41. Maintaining the current, significantly limited schedule for Mother is no longer consistent with the Child’s best interests, given the changed circumstances described above.

42. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, as interpreted by *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 182–84, *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 149–50, and related authority, the Court should therefore modify the 2018 Judgment to increase Mother’s parenting time and overnights in a manner consistent with the Child’s best interests.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

43. Mother does not, by this Complaint, seek to eliminate Father’s role as a parent or to disturb the Child’s overall stability; rather, she seeks a modification that meaningfully increases her overnights and parenting time so that the Child may enjoy a fuller relationship with both parents.

44. Mother requests that the Court enter a modified parenting plan that, at a minimum, substantially increases Mother’s overnights and weekend time with the Child, and provides for regular, predictable parenting time with Mother during the school week, consistent with the Child’s school and activity schedule.

45. Mother respectfully requests that the Court, after hearing, adopt a parenting plan that may include, but need not be limited to, the following general features, subject to the Court’s determination of the Child’s best interests:

   a. Significantly increased weekend time with Mother, including overnights on alternating or more frequent weekends;  
   b. Increased weeknight overnights with Mother, on a regular weekly basis, with appropriate arrangements for school days and transportation;  
   c. A division of holidays, vacations, and school breaks that affords the Child substantial and meaningful time with Mother; and  
   d. Any additional provisions (such as communication protocols and decision-making processes) that the Court deems appropriate to reduce conflict and to protect the Child’s emotional well-being.

46. Mother further requests that the Court confirm or allocate legal custody consistent with the Child’s best interests, including consideration of joint legal custody if appropriate, recognizing the importance of both parents’ involvement in major decisions concerning the Child. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05.

47. To the extent necessary, Mother requests that the Court order that the parties reasonably cooperate in facilitating the Child’s ongoing therapy and avoid placing the Child in the middle of parental conflict regarding her expressed wishes for time with each parent.

48. Mother also requests that the Court enter any additional orders or modifications that are necessary to effectuate the revised parenting schedule and to promote the Child’s stability and best interests.

### VIII. STATUTORY AND CASE LAW SUPPORT (SUMMARY)

49. The relief requested herein is supported by, among other authorities:
