In this case, the judge\u2019s task was not complete once he had determined that the mother should not have custody of her children. Also, he should have addressed the various placement options which would further the children\u2019s best interests... [G.L. c. 119, \u00a7 26] provides that [the judge may] \u201cmake any other appropriate order with reference to the care and custody of the child as may conduce to his best interests.\u201d"
