      "support_reasoning": "The quoted portion is a concurrence/dissent, not the majority, but it accurately reflects that the court was recognizing a change from caveat emptor toward an implied obligation tied to habitability standards. Justice Quirico expressly accepts that, for dwelling units, landlords have an implied obligation\u2014grounded in G.L. c. 111, \u00a7 127A and the State Sanitary Code\u2014to meet minimum fitness-for-human-habitation standards, and that this obligation is interdependent with the tenant\u2019s rent obligation. While he criticizes the majority\u2019s broader, less code\u2011tethered \u2018warranty of habitability,\u2019 his reasoning still supports the proposition that the case (and the statutory/code scheme it relies on) reinforces landlords\u2019 duties to maintain residential premises, including common areas, in a condition fit for human habitation and reasonably secure against foreseeable harms.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSince 1960 dwelling units have been subject to the State Sanitary Code\u2026 It expressly provides that \u2018[n]o person shall \u2026 let to another for occupancy any dwelling, dwelling unit, or rooming unit\u2026 which does not comply\u2019 with its provisions, and further provides a criminal penalty for violation of its provisions. It expressly places the burden on the owner to comply with the prescribed minimum physical standards for rented dwelling units\u2026 [T]he various statutes, ordinances, by-laws, rules, regulations and codes prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards\u2026\u201d}"
