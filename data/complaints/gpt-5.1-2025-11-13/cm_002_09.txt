COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
MIDDLESEX DIVISION  

------------------------------------------------------  
SARAH THOMPSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No. __________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson (“Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is an individual who currently resides, or intends imminently to reside, in the State of New Hampshire. He is the father of the minor child, Emily Johnson.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Emily Johnson, born in 2018, age seven (7).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6, and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as incorporated and applied to custody and parenting matters in the Probate and Family Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Division of the Probate and Family Court because this Court issued the existing custody and parenting order dated June 15, 2021, and because the child resides in Middlesex County. See G.L. c. 208, § 6; G.L. c. 209C, § 7 (where applicable).

6. This Court retains continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time issues affecting the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the Massachusetts Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”), G.L. c. 209B.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

7. On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment/Order (the “2021 Order”) establishing legal and physical custody and a parenting-time schedule for the parties’ minor child, Emily.

8. Under the 2021 Order, primary physical custody of Emily was granted to Mother, with Father exercising parenting time consisting of:  
   a. Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time; and  
   b. Every other weekend parenting time, with the usual associated pick-up and drop-off arrangements.

9. The 2021 Order and parenting schedule were premised on the parties then residing in relative proximity to each other in the Cambridge area in Middlesex County, and on Emily attending local school and activities in that area.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2021 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the feasibility and best interests of the existing parenting-time schedule, specifically relating to Father’s planned relocation to New Hampshire.

11. Father has obtained or seeks to obtain a job opportunity in New Hampshire and has indicated his intent to relocate his residence to New Hampshire while seeking to maintain the current parenting schedule unchanged.

12. Father’s intended relocation will significantly increase the distance and travel time between the parents’ residences, from a relatively short, local commute to an approximately ninety (90) minute drive each way in typical traffic conditions between New Hampshire and the Cambridge/Middlesex County area where Emily resides and attends school.

13. The existing 2021 Order’s Wednesday midweek overnight schedule presumed that both parents lived in close geographic proximity such that school-day transportation would be short, routine, and minimally disruptive.

14. In light of Father’s intended move, continuing the Wednesday midweek overnight would require Emily to:  
   a. Travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way on school nights;  
   b. Awaken substantially earlier than her typical schedule to travel back from New Hampshire to her school in Middlesex County; and  
   c. Potentially miss, be late for, or experience increased stress regarding her after-school activities, routines, and homework.

15. The travel burden associated with a midweek, out-of-state overnight is qualitatively different from the prior local commute and constitutes a substantial change that was not contemplated by the 2021 Order.

16. Emily is seven (7) years old, of elementary-school age, and requires age-appropriate routines, sleep, and stability to support her academic performance, emotional health, and participation in extracurricular activities.

17. Mother has observed that Emily has already begun experiencing anxiety related to the longer drives, potential early-morning wake-ups, and concerns about missing or being late to her after-school activities.

18. Emily has expressed worry about the length of the drives, the possibility of being tired at school, and the disruption to her normal school-week routines.

19. The planned relocation and resulting travel implications significantly impact Emily’s day-to-day school life and emotional well-being, and therefore constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law.

20. Under Massachusetts law, modification of a custody or parenting-time order requires a showing of both a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., *Champagne v. Champagne*, 429 Mass. 324 (1999); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012).

21. The facts set forth above—Father’s relocation to New Hampshire, the increased travel distance and time, the impact on Emily’s sleep, school attendance, after-school activities, and emotional health—constitute such a material and substantial change.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

22. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

23. In determining best interests, the Court considers, among other things: the child’s age and developmental needs; the child’s relationship with each parent; the child’s educational and emotional needs; the stability of each parent’s home; and the effect of travel and transitions on the child. See *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

24. Maintaining frequent and meaningful contact with both parents is important, but it must be structured in a way that does not unduly disrupt the child’s schooling, sleep, health, or emotional well-being. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 908 (2005).

25. A midweek, out-of-state overnight with a ninety (90) minute commute each way on school days is not developmentally appropriate for a seven-year-old child on a recurring basis, particularly where it results in lost sleep, increased stress, and disruption to school and activities.

26. The current schedule was crafted when both parents lived close to each other and to Emily’s school; its continued application under materially changed geographic circumstances would impose burdens on Emily that did not exist and were not foreseen at the time of the 2021 Order.

27. Stable school-week routines and predictable attendance are central to Emily’s academic performance and emotional regulation. See, as guidance, *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43 (stability and continuity are key best-interests factors).

28. The increased travel associated with the current Wednesday overnight creates a substantial risk that Emily will:  
   a. Be overtired during school days;  
   b. Experience heightened anxiety and emotional distress;  
   c. Struggle to participate consistently in after-school activities that are important to her development and socialization; and  
   d. Experience difficulty maintaining focus and performance in school.

29. Massachusetts courts have recognized that significant changes in a parent’s residence and the resulting impact on a child’s schedule, school life, and emotional health can justify modification of parenting-time arrangements. See, e.g., *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Murphy v. Murphy*, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 513 (1986); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012).

30. While Father’s desire to pursue employment opportunities is understandable, Emily’s best interests must remain the controlling factor. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

31. A reasonable reallocation of parenting time that preserves Emily’s relationship with Father, but in a manner that minimizes school-week disruption and prioritizes weekends or non-school days for longer-distance travel, is in Emily’s best interests.

32. Modifying the order to eliminate the midweek overnight and to adjust the weekend schedule to account for distance will:  
   a. Preserve Emily’s primary school-week residence and routines with Mother;  
   b. Allow Emily to continue meaningful contact with Father;  
   c. Reduce the length and frequency of late-night or early-morning travel on school days; and  
   d. Address Emily’s increasing anxiety and stress regarding long drives and missed activities.

33. Mother’s proposed modification is narrowly tailored to the specific changes arising from Father’s relocation and is consistent with Massachusetts law favoring arrangements that foster the child’s welfare and stability. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

### VI. LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR MODIFICATION

34. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parents” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the child.

35. Massachusetts appellate decisions have consistently held that modification of custody or parenting-time orders is appropriate when: (1) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) the proposed modification is necessary to serve the child’s best interests. See *Champagne v. Champagne*, 429 Mass. 324 (1999); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

36. When geography, travel demands, or changed family circumstances undermine the practical functioning of an existing schedule or adversely affect a child’s schooling and emotional well-being, courts have authority to adjust parenting time accordingly. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Murphy v. Murphy*, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 513 (1986); *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).

37. G.L. c. 208, § 31 emphasizes that custody and visitation determinations must be based on the best interests of the child, including the child’s welfare, happiness, and development, and directs the Court to consider stability, continuity, and the child’s relationship with each parent.

38. The relief requested by Mother is also consistent with G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (where applicable), which authorizes modification of custody and visitation orders concerning nonmarital children upon a comparable showing of changed circumstances and the child’s best interests.

39. G.L. c. 215, § 6 grants the Probate and Family Court broad equitable powers to enter such orders and judgments as law and justice may require in matters of child custody and visitation.

40. The requested modification does not seek to sever or diminish the parent-child relationship between Father and Emily, but to restructure parenting time in a manner that responds to Father’s relocation while protecting Emily’s school-week stability and emotional health, as required by the case law cited above.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

41. Mother seeks modification only to the extent necessary to address the material change in circumstances arising from Father’s relocation and its impact on Emily’s school-week schedule, travel burden, and emotional well-being.

42. Specifically, Mother respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Eliminate the existing Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time with Father, in light of his relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting ninety (90) minute each-way commute on school nights;  

   b. Convert Father’s prior Wednesday parenting time into a reasonable non-overnight midweek visit (for example, a midweek dinner visit or virtual/telephone parenting time), if and as feasible and appropriate given the distance and Emily’s school schedule, so long as such contact does not unduly interfere with Emily’s homework, bedtime, and after-school activities;  

   c. Maintain Father’s every-other-weekend parenting time, but clarify that, in light of the distance, pick-up and drop-off times may reasonably be adjusted (for example, slightly earlier pick-up on Friday and/or slightly earlier drop-off on Sunday) to minimize late-night or early-morning travel for Emily;  

   d. Allocate or clarify transportation responsibilities in a manner that minimizes disruption to Emily’s school attendance, sleep, and activities, taking into account Father’s chosen relocation and the practicalities of the distance;  

   e. Order that the parties confer in good faith regarding reasonable holiday, school-vacation, and summer parenting-time arrangements that provide Father with meaningful time with Emily when school is not in session, thereby reducing the burden of long-distance travel during the school week; and  

   f. Enter such additional or alternative parenting-time provisions as the Court deems just, equitable, and in Emily’s best interests in light of Father’s relocation and the evidence presented.

43. Mother does not seek to alter Father’s legal relationship with Emily or to eliminate his parenting time, but only to modify the structure of the parenting schedule to reflect current geographic realities and to prioritize Emily’s welfare consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the governing case law.

44. The requested modification is reasonable, proportionate to the changed circumstances, and designed to preserve Emily’s relationship with both parents while minimizing harm to her schooling, health, and emotional stability.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the June 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time order, specifically including Father’s relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting increase in travel time and disruption to Emily’s school-week schedule;

2. Find that modification of the existing parenting-time schedule is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 31, § 31, and applicable case law;

3. Modify the existing Judgment/Order to:  
   a. Remove the Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time with Father;  
   b. Establish an alternative, developmentally appropriate structure for midweek contact (such as a non-overnight midweek visit, telephone, or virtual contact), consistent with Emily’s school-week needs;  
   c. Maintain or reasonably adjust the every-other-weekend parenting schedule to account for travel distance while preserving substantial weekend parenting time with Father; and  
   d. Allocate transportation responsibilities and define pick-up and drop-off times in a way that minimizes disruption to Emily’s sleep, school, and after-school activities;

4. Order that the parties cooperate in developing an appropriate holiday, school-vacation, and summer schedule that affords Father meaningful parenting time during periods when school is not in session, consistent with Emily’s best interests and the realities of the distance between the parties’ residences;

5. Grant such further relief, including temporary orders pending final judgment, as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child; and

6. Award to such party as the Court deems appropriate any other relief consistent with equity and the best interests of the child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
SARAH THOMPSON,
