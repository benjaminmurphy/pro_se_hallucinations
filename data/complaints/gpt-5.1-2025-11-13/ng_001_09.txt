CIVIL ACTION NO. _____________  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PERSONAL INJURY)  

-----------------------------------------------------  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee at Defendant’s premises.

2. Defendant Fresh Market Grocery (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, a business entity organized and existing under the laws of Massachusetts or another state, doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and operating a retail grocery store located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, maintained, and/or controlled the Premises, including the aisles, floors, and dairy section where Plaintiff fell.

4. This is an action for personal injuries and related damages arising out of Defendant’s negligence in maintaining its Premises in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore is within the original jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2 because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County and Defendant conducts business in Middlesex County.

7. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to G.L. c. 223A, § 3 because, among other things, Defendant transacts business in Massachusetts and the claims asserted herein arise from Defendant’s conduct within the Commonwealth.  

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

8. On or about September 16, 2023, at approximately a Saturday afternoon time to be further ascertained in discovery, Plaintiff entered Defendant’s grocery store at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, as a paying customer and business invitee.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was exercising due care for her own safety while shopping at Defendant’s store.

10. Plaintiff proceeded into the dairy aisle of the Premises to select grocery items customarily sold by Defendant in that section.

11. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a substantial puddle of spilled milk located on the floor of the aisle.

12. The puddle of spilled milk was not small or isolated; it was sufficiently large that shopping cart tracks were visibly passing through the spill area, indicating that other customers and carts had already traversed the spill.

13. There were no “wet floor,” “caution,” or similar warning signs, cones, barriers, or other protective devices placed in or around the puddle of spilled milk to warn customers such as Plaintiff of the hazardous condition.

14. The floor surface in the dairy aisle where the milk had spilled was rendered slippery and dangerous by the presence of the spilled liquid.

15. As Plaintiff stepped into the puddle of spilled milk, her foot slipped out from under her, causing her to lose balance and fall violently to the floor, landing heavily on her hip.

16. As a direct and immediate result of the fall, Plaintiff experienced sudden and significant pain in her hip and associated discomfort.

17. At the time of the incident, there was an employee of Defendant, identified as a store employee engaged in stocking shelves, located approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the puddle where Plaintiff fell.

18. Immediately after Plaintiff fell, the nearby employee came over to her.

19. The employee stated, in substance and effect, that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but had chosen to continue “finishing up what [he] was doing” before going to get a mop to clean the spill.

20. The employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual knowledge of the hazardous milk spill prior to Plaintiff’s fall and failed to take timely and reasonable steps to either clean the spill or warn customers of the danger.

21. No employee of Defendant placed warning signs, cones, or barriers around the spill area prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

22. No employee of Defendant promptly cleaned, dried, or otherwise remedied the milk spill prior to Plaintiff’s fall, despite knowing of its existence.

23. Plaintiff, not appreciating the full extent of her injuries at the time, completed her shopping and then left the store.

24. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s hip pain worsened significantly, and she experienced increasing difficulty with walking, moving, and performing normal activities of daily living.

25. On or about the following day, September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical attention at an urgent care facility due to her worsening hip pain.

26. Medical providers at the urgent care facility evaluated Plaintiff and diagnosed her with a hip sprain.

27. Plaintiff was advised to rest, avoid aggravating activities, and follow up with further treatment, including physical therapy.

28. As her symptoms persisted, Plaintiff underwent a course of physical therapy to address her hip injury, pain, and functional limitations.

29. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for urgent care, evaluation, and physical therapy related to the injuries she sustained as a result of her fall at Defendant’s Premises.

30. Prior to the incident, Plaintiff was employed at a café job, where she regularly worked shifts and earned wages.

31. Due to pain, limited mobility, and medical appointments associated with her hip injury, Plaintiff missed multiple shifts and was unable to work for a period of time during her recovery.

32. Plaintiff suffered a loss of wages of approximately $1,200 as a result of her inability to work caused by the injuries she sustained in the fall.

33. In addition to medical expenses and lost wages, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment of life.

34. Plaintiff has also experienced inconvenience, emotional distress, and disruption to her daily activities as a result of her injuries.

35. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a business invitee, to use reasonable care to maintain its Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers of which it knew or reasonably should have known.

36. Defendant, through its employees, agents, and/or servants acting within the scope of their employment, breached that duty by, among other things, failing to promptly clean the milk spill, failing to warn customers of the known hazard, and allowing a dangerous condition to persist in an area open to customers.

37. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped on the spilled milk, fell, and sustained the injuries and damages described herein.

38. Plaintiff has complied with, or is not subject to, all applicable statutory and procedural prerequisites for filing this action, including the statute of limitations set forth in G.L. c. 260, § 2A.  

APPLICABLE LAW  

39. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or occupier who invites the public onto its premises for business purposes owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect lawful visitors against foreseeable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (abrogating common-law distinction between invitees and licensees and imposing duty of reasonable care owed to all lawful visitors).

40. In premises liability actions, a plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care, breached that duty, and that the breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (setting forth elements of negligence); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (same).

41. A store owner is liable when it (a) created a dangerous condition, (b) had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition and failed to remedy it, or (c) should have known of the condition because it existed for such a length of time that the owner, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 782–83 (2007) (articulating mode-of-operation and notice principles in self-service grocery context); Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc., 471 Mass. 679, 683–84 (2015) (duty of premises owner regarding hazardous conditions).

42. Defendant, operating a self-service grocery store with dairy products, was required to take reasonable precautions to protect customers from foreseeable hazards such as spilled liquids in aisles where customers routinely handle and transport perishable products. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 786–87 (self-service store must anticipate spills and take reasonable measures).

43. A store is charged with the knowledge of its employees acting within the scope of their employment. See Federal Nat’l Mortg. Ass’n v. Hendricks, 463 Mass. 635, 642–43 (2012) (knowledge of agents imputed to principal); Restatement (Second) of Agency § 272.

44. Defendant’s employee, who admitted having noticed the spill “a few minutes” before Plaintiff’s fall yet failing to clean or warn about it, had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition and his knowledge is imputed to Defendant.

45. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, comparative negligence, if any, on the part of Plaintiff does not bar recovery unless Plaintiff’s negligence exceeds the total negligence of the Defendant; any damages awarded shall be diminished in proportion to any causal negligence attributable to Plaintiff.

46. Plaintiff at all relevant times exercised reasonable care for her own safety and had no actual knowledge of the presence of the spilled milk prior to her fall.

47. The condition of the floor—containing a visible puddle of milk, with cart tracks through it and an employee nearby who had observed the spill—was such that Defendant either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the hazard and taken appropriate steps to remove or warn of it. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (notice may be shown by time condition existed); Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961) (liability where store had actual or constructive notice of foreign substance on floor).

48. A failure to warn or to remedy a known or reasonably discoverable hazardous condition on a commercial premises constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care. See Thurlow v. Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc., 49 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 177–78 (2000) (grocery store potentially liable for failure to deal with known spill); Falden v. Braun, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 1124 (2011) (Rule 1:28 decision) (upholding premises liability claim where defendant failed to remedy known hazard).

49. Causation and damages are established where, as here, Plaintiff’s injuries were a foreseeable result of slipping on a liquid spill left on the floor in a self-service grocery aisle and Plaintiff in fact suffered physical injury, medical expenses, and lost wages. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002) (causation); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431.

50. Plaintiff’s claims are timely commenced within the applicable three-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions set forth in G.L. c. 260, § 2A.  

COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST DEFENDANT FRESH MARKET GROCERY)  

51. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 50 as if fully set forth herein.

52. At all times relevant, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful customer and business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including the dairy aisle, in a reasonably safe condition, to inspect for hazards, to clean and remedy dangerous conditions, and to warn of known or reasonably foreseeable dangers. See Mounsey, 363 Mass. at 707–08; Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 782–83.

53. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to maintain the dairy aisle floor in a reasonably safe condition;  
   b. Failing to implement and/or follow reasonable policies and procedures for regular inspection and timely cleanup of spills and other hazards in store aisles, particularly in self-service product areas where spills are reasonably foreseeable;  
   c. Failing to promptly clean or remove the puddle of spilled milk despite actual knowledge of its presence;  
   d. Failing to place any warning signs, cones, barriers, or other devices to alert customers to the presence of the slippery, hazardous condition;  
   e. Failing to cordon off or temporarily close the affected area until the spill was cleaned and the floor was safe for customers to traverse;  
   f. Failing to adequately train and/or supervise its employees regarding timely response to known spills and customer safety;  
   g. Permitting the hazardous condition to exist for an unreasonable period of time after it was discovered by an employee; and  
   h. Otherwise failing to exercise due and reasonable care under the circumstances then and there existing.

54. The conduct and omissions of Defendant’s employee who saw the spill “a few minutes” before Plaintiff’s fall and chose to delay cleanup are attributable to Defendant under the doctrines of respondeat superior and vicarious liability. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 322–23 (2002).

55. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that a puddle of spilled milk on a smooth store floor in a customer aisle created an unreasonably dangerous condition, posing a foreseeable risk of slip-and-fall injuries to customers.

56. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that its failure to promptly clean the spilled milk or adequately warn patrons would likely result in injury to customers walking in the aisle.

57. Defendant’s above-described acts and omissions constitute a breach of the duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts common law and statutes, including but not limited to the principles set forth in Mounsey, Sheehan, Sarkisian, and related cases.

58. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped on the spilled milk, fell, and suffered a hip sprain and related injuries.

59. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred and will continue to incur medical expenses in an amount reasonably believed to be approximately $2,500 to date, with the possibility of additional expenses in the future for further treatment, evaluation, and/or therapy.

60. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered lost wages and impairment of earning capacity, including approximately $1,200 in lost wages to date due to missed work at her café job.

61. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain and suffering, including hip pain, discomfort, and limitation of movement.

62. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, emotional distress, and disruption of her normal daily activities.

63. Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses are of a nature such that she is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation from Defendant for: medical expenses (past and future), lost wages and diminished earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

64. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, any negligence attributable to Plaintiff that may be claimed or alleged by Defendant is less than any negligence of Defendant; in any event, Plaintiff’s recovery, if any comparative negligence is found, should only be diminished in proportion to her percentage of fault, if any, and not barred.

65. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing the injuries and damages suffered by Plaintiff.

66. Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on her damages from the date of commencement of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B.
