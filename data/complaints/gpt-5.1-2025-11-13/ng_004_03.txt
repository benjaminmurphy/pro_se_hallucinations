    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Jordan Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Emily Carter (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Emily Carter is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner, controller, and/or person in charge of the real property located at 45 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, controlled, managed, and/or was responsible for the maintenance of the sidewalk and means of ingress and egress immediately adjacent to and appurtenant to the Property at 45 Maple Street, Worcester, MA.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for damages arising from personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff in a slip-and-fall incident that occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts.

5. The amount of damages reasonably anticipated to be recovered by Plaintiff exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore is within the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Worcester County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the cause of action arose in Worcester County and the Property where the incident occurred is located at 45 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 6 as if fully set forth herein.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled a three-unit residential apartment building located at 45 Maple Street, Worcester, MA (the “Building”).

9. The sidewalk immediately in front of and appurtenant to the Building, including the pathway customarily used by tenants, visitors, delivery personnel, and other lawful entrants, was under the control and maintenance responsibility of Defendant, who exercised actual control and undertook to clear snow and ice thereon.

10. On or about February 8–9, 2023, a winter storm deposited snow and ice on the sidewalk in front of the Building.

11. Following the storm, Defendant undertook to shovel the sidewalk and created and maintained a narrow, shoveled path down the middle of the sidewalk leading to and from the Building and along the frontage of the Property.

12. Defendant failed to apply any ice melt, salt, sand, or other traction or de-icing material to the shoveled pathway or adjacent areas of the sidewalk.

13. Over the next couple of days after the storm, daytime temperatures caused partial melting of packed snow and ice on and around the shoveled pathway, while nighttime freezing temperatures caused that melted water to refreeze on the pathway, creating a slippery and hazardous sheet of ice on the sidewalk in front of the Property.

14. This cycle of melting and refreezing occurred repeatedly, resulting in a dangerous condition of accumulated ice on Defendant’s sidewalk and on the narrow path Defendant had created and maintained.

15. Tenants of the Building, who regularly used the sidewalk, observed the dangerous icy condition and became concerned that someone would fall and be injured.

16. Prior to Plaintiff’s injury, these tenants notified Defendant of the hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk by text message, and they sent Defendant photographs of the ice accumulation on and around the shoveled pathway.

17. Upon information and belief, Defendant received the tenants’ text messages and photographs, and thereby had actual notice of the hazardous icy condition on the sidewalk.

18. In response to the tenants’ warning, Defendant stated, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” and took no additional reasonable steps to salt, sand, or otherwise mitigate or eliminate the hazardous condition.

19. Defendant’s failure to act persisted for at least several days after receiving actual notice of the dangerous condition.

20. On February 10, 2023, at approximately daytime hours, Plaintiff was lawfully present on the sidewalk in front of 45 Maple Street in the course of delivering groceries to one of the tenants of the Building.

21. Plaintiff was a lawful visitor and invitee on the premises, reasonably expected and foreseeably present as a delivery person using the customary means of access to the Building.

22. Plaintiff walked along the sidewalk and onto the narrow shoveled pathway maintained by Defendant in the same manner as any reasonable pedestrian and delivery person would do under similar circumstances.

23. As Plaintiff traversed the sidewalk and the narrow shoveled path, Plaintiff encountered the sheet of ice created and maintained by Defendant’s shoveling without proper treatment and by the repeated melting and refreezing cycles.

24. Without warning, Plaintiff’s feet slipped out from under him on the icy surface, and Plaintiff fell backward, landing forcefully on his lower back on the sidewalk.

25. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in his lower back and difficulty moving as a result of the fall.

26. After the incident, tenants of the Building informed Plaintiff that they had previously texted Defendant about the icy sidewalk, had sent photographs of the condition, and that Defendant had told them that “the sun will take care of it,” indicating Defendant’s prior knowledge and disregard of the danger.

27. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained an injury to his lower back, including but not limited to pain, strain, and related soft-tissue and musculoskeletal injuries requiring medical treatment.

28. Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for his lower back injury, including doctor visits and related care.

29. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500 in past medical expenses as a result of the injury.

30. Due to the pain and limitations from the injury, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week and lost about $600 in wages.

31. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and discomfort in his lower back and has suffered, and may in the future suffer, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and impairment in his normal daily activities.

32. At all relevant times, Plaintiff acted with due care for his own safety, walked in a normal manner along the customary path, and had no reasonable opportunity to detect, avoid, or protect himself against the invisible or difficult-to-discern ice hazard created and allowed to persist by Defendant.

33. The dangerous icy condition of the sidewalk on February 10, 2023, was not open and obvious in such a manner that would relieve Defendant of her duty, as the ice was clear and blended with the surrounding pavement and was located on the very path Defendant had shoveled for pedestrian use.

34. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that tenants, visitors, delivery personnel, and the general public would use the narrow, shoveled pathway as the intended route and that the presence of untreated ice posed an unreasonable risk of physical harm.

35. Defendant had adequate time and opportunity, over the course of multiple days following the storm and after actual notice from tenants, to take reasonable steps to remedy, treat, or warn of the icy condition, including but not limited to applying salt or sand, scraping residual ice, or temporarily closing the path and providing an alternative safe route.

36. Defendant failed to take such reasonable steps and allowed the dangerous icy condition to continue to exist on the sidewalk adjacent to and under her control, thereby creating and/or maintaining an unreasonably unsafe condition for lawful visitors and invitees such as Plaintiff.

---

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

38. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful visitor and invitee on the premises, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property, including the sidewalk and means of access, in a reasonably safe condition and to protect against reasonably foreseeable risks of harm.

39. Under Massachusetts law, landowners and possessors of land owe lawful visitors a duty of reasonable care in the circumstances, including with respect to conditions of snow and ice. *See* G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (abolishing distinction between natural and unnatural accumulations of snow and ice and holding that property owners owe lawful visitors a duty of reasonable care as to all hazards arising from snow and ice).

40. The duty of reasonable care requires a property owner who undertakes to clear snow and ice from areas of pedestrian traffic to do so in a manner that does not unreasonably increase the risk of harm and to act reasonably in light of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards. *See* *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 379–80; *Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc.*, 471 Mass. 679, 683–84 (2015).

41. Defendant, having actual control over and having undertaken to clear the sidewalk and create a narrow shoveled path, owed Plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care in clearing, treating, and maintaining that path, and in warning of any dangerous condition thereon. *See* *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 153–54 (2013) (duty arises from control over area and assumption of responsibility for maintenance).

**Breach**

42. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other acts and omissions, the following:

   a. Creating and/or maintaining a narrow shoveled path on the sidewalk without applying salt, sand, or other de-icing or traction materials, despite foreseeable melting and refreezing;

   b. Failing to reasonably inspect, monitor, or maintain the sidewalk and path over multiple days following the storm;

   c. Failing to take reasonable steps to treat, remove, or mitigate the known sheet of ice that developed on the shoveled path used by pedestrians;

   d. Failing to act upon actual notice from tenants who warned Defendant about the hazardous icy condition and provided photographs of the danger;

   e. Relying on the “sun” to eliminate the danger instead of taking reasonable, timely, and readily available steps to correct it;

   f. Failing to post warnings, barriers, or other means to prevent foreseeable users from walking on the dangerous icy path;

   g. Failing to conform to the standard of care exercised by a reasonably prudent property owner under like circumstances in Worcester, Massachusetts.

43. Defendant’s failure to reasonably maintain the sidewalk and the path, despite the foreseeable risk of harm and actual notice of the dangerous condition, constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care recognized under Massachusetts law. *See* *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 378–80; *Sarkisian*, 471 Mass. at 683–84; *Schultz v. Grogean*, 406 Mass. 364, 366–67 (1990).

44. Defendant’s conduct also constitutes an unreasonable failure to protect foreseeable entrants, including delivery personnel such as Plaintiff, from a known or reasonably knowable hazard, in violation of the general duty of care owed by property owners and occupiers. *See* *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

**Causation**

45. The dangerous icy condition on the sidewalk and shoveled path was a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s acts and omissions described above, including the failure to adequately treat or remove ice or to warn of its presence, after having undertaken to clear the path and after receiving actual notice.

46. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s slip and fall on February 10, 2023, and the resulting injuries, in that, but for Defendant’s negligent clearing and maintenance of the sidewalk and failure to remedy the icy condition or warn of it, Plaintiff would not have slipped and fallen and sustained injury.

47. The harm to Plaintiff was the very kind of harm that makes Defendant’s conduct negligent and was reasonably foreseeable in light of Defendant’s knowledge of the icy condition and the common risk of slips and falls arising from untreated snow and ice on pedestrian pathways in winter. *See* *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (foreseeability and scope of duty); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006).

**Damages**

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries to his lower back, including pain, physical impairment, and related medical conditions.

49. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for examination, diagnosis, and treatment of his injuries.

50. Plaintiff lost approximately one week of wages, totaling about $600, due to his inability to work as a result of the injury sustained in the fall.

51. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer conscious pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of his usual activities.

52. Plaintiff may incur future medical expenses and may suffer future pain, disability, and limitations as a result of the injuries he sustained.

53. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged comparative negligence on the part of Plaintiff, which Plaintiff expressly denies, does not bar recovery so long as Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than that of Defendant, and any damages recoverable by Plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to any negligence attributable to Plaintiff.

54. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for his personal injuries, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by a jury.

## V. APPLICABLE LAW (NON-EXHAUSTIVE AUTHORITIES)

55. Plaintiff’s claim is brought under Massachusetts common law negligence principles, as clarified and applied in, among others, the following authorities:

   a. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (duty of reasonable care as to all hazards arising from snow and ice; abolition of natural/unnatural distinction);

   b. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (property owners owe duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors);

   c. *Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc.*, 471 Mass. 679 (2015) (application of *Papadopoulos* and premises liability for snow and ice conditions);

   d. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148 (2013) (duty arising from control and assumption of responsibility for maintenance);

   e. *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (landowner’s duty to lawful visitors; foreseeability of harm);

   f. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (elements of negligence and foreseeability);

   g. *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (scope of duty and foreseeability of injury);

   h. *Schultz v. Grogean*, 406 Mass. 364 (1990) (premises liability; duty to maintain safe conditions);

   i. G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence);

   j. G.L. c. 212, § 3 (Superior Court jurisdiction over civil actions with reasonable likelihood of recovery exceeding statutory minimum);

   k. G.L. c. 223, §§ 1–2 (venue and transitory actions).

56. Plaintiff does not bring any statutory claim, but relies on these statutes and cases as they define and govern the common-law duty of care, jurisdiction, comparative negligence, and other procedural and substantive standards applicable to this action.
