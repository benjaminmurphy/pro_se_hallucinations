      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses the mother\u2019s serious substance abuse problem as part of a broader pattern of parental unfitness (abandonment, failure to visit, failure to communicate, missed appointments), but it does not specifically address misuse of alcohol or drugs during periods of responsibility for the child, such as overnight care. Nor does it expressly analyze how substance use during caretaking presents a specific risk to the child\u2019s physical safety or emotional security. The case therefore supports substance abuse as a factor in parental unfitness and best\u2011interests analysis, but not the more particularized proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We conclude that the department met its burden of proving parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. Although some of the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings were erroneous, the judge amply supported his conclusion that the mother is currently unfit to care for her child. The judge made fifty-nine findings that demonstrate a history of substance abuse, a pattern of late and missed appointments, failure to communicate her whereabouts to the department, and a minimal amount of communication with the child over a significant period of time."

Felton v. Felton addresses modification of visitation based on a noncustodial parent\u2019s religious instruction and holds that visitation limits require detailed proof of specific physical or emotional harm; it does not discuss overnights, rest, school functioning, or educational impact. While Felton generally stresses the need for concrete evidence of harm to the child, it does not provide authority for the specific proposition about post-weekend exhaustion and reduced school functioning from overnight visits.",

The court also favorably cites expert testimony proposing supervised visitation if counseling conditions are not met.
