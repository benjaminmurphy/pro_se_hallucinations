COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time / Conditions)  
------------------------------------------------------  

PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Sullivan (“Mother” or “Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Thompson (date of birth omitted for privacy; currently 8 years old).

2. The Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Father” or “Defendant”), is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, because the prior custody and parenting-time judgment was entered in this Court and the child resides within the Commonwealth.

PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment or Order concerning custody and parenting time for the minor child Ethan Thompson (the “2021 Custody Order”).

5. The 2021 Custody Order provided, among other things, that:

   a. The parties would share legal custody of Ethan; and  
   b. Ethan would primarily reside with the Mother; and  
   c. The Father would have scheduled parenting time, including overnights on certain weekends at the Father’s residence.

6. At the time of entry of the 2021 Custody Order, the Court found or assumed that both parties were stable, capable of co‑parenting, and able to provide a safe, sober, and appropriate environment for Ethan during their respective parenting time.

7. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, § 31; and the Court’s broad equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6 and § 3, to modify custody and parenting-time provisions when a material and substantial change in circumstances affects the best interests of a minor child.

MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances relating to the Father’s apparent use of alcohol or other intoxicating substances during his parenting time with Ethan, creating safety concerns and affecting Ethan’s well-being.

9. Over approximately the past year, and increasingly in recent months, Ethan has made statements to the Mother indicating that at the Father’s home there are “special drinks” and that the Father sometimes “can’t walk straight.”

10. Ethan’s statements have been spontaneous and consistent in their content and have caused the Mother serious concern that the Father may be impaired by alcohol or other substances while responsible for Ethan’s care.

11. On at least one recent occasion, a neighbor, who is aware that Ethan is the parties’ minor child, observed the Father with Ethan late at night and was sufficiently worried to record a video and send it to the Mother.

12. In that video, which the Mother has viewed, the Father appears to be stumbling while getting Ethan out of the car late at night, suggesting that the Father may have been intoxicated or otherwise impaired while transporting and supervising the child.

13. The Mother reasonably believes that the neighbor has no motive to fabricate or exaggerate the Father’s condition, and the video independently corroborates Ethan’s reports that the Father sometimes “can’t walk straight.”

14. The Mother is informed and believes that the Father’s apparent impairment occurs during times when he is solely responsible for Ethan’s care, including during or immediately following transportation of Ethan by motor vehicle.

15. In addition, Ethan’s school has communicated to the Mother that Ethan frequently appears exhausted and overtired on Monday mornings, following weekends spent at the Father’s home.

16. The Mother is informed and believes, and therefore avers, that Ethan’s exhaustion on Mondays is related to inadequate sleep, lack of consistent bedtime routines, and possible late-night activity at the Father’s home during his weekend parenting time.

17. The pattern of Ethan’s reports, the neighbor’s video of the Father stumbling with Ethan late at night, and the school’s observations of Ethan’s exhaustion together reflect significant new circumstances that did not exist or were not known to the Court at the time of the 2021 Custody Order.

18. These circumstances call into question the stability and safety of the Father’s home environment and his ability to safely exercise unsupervised overnight parenting time, especially if he is consuming alcohol or other substances to the point of impairment while responsible for Ethan.

19. The Father’s apparent impairment while caring for Ethan creates risks to Ethan’s physical safety (including while traveling by car) and to Ethan’s emotional well-being, and constitutes a material and substantial change of circumstances warranting modification of the existing order.

20. The Mother has acted promptly and reasonably upon learning of these issues and, consistent with her duty to protect Ethan and to act in his best interests, brings this Complaint to request safer, more structured conditions on the Father’s overnights and/or a change in the nature of those overnights.

BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

21. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 208, § 28.

22. The Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have repeatedly affirmed that a prior custody or parenting-time order may be modified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g.:

   a. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998) (modification appropriate where material change affects best interests);  
   b. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests are paramount; circumstances at time of modification control);  
   c. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (court must consider stability and continuity, but may modify where new risks emerge);  
   d. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (change in circumstances and need to protect child support modification of parenting arrangement);  
   e. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (material and substantial change is threshold for modifying custody).

23. In determining the best interests of the child, the Court considers, among other factors, the child’s physical safety, emotional security, and the parties’ relative abilities to provide a stable, nurturing, and sober environment. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–45.

24. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that a parent’s abuse or misuse of alcohol or other substances, especially when responsible for the care of a minor child, is a legitimate and serious factor in assessing custody, parenting time, and the need for conditions or restrictions. See, e.g.:

   a. Adoption of Irene, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 613 (2002) (parent’s alcohol abuse relevant to ability to safely parent);  
   b. Adoption of Katharine, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 25 (1997) (substance abuse and failure to protect child support restrictions on parental role);  
   c. Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 595 (1981) (parental unfitness may be shown by chronic substance abuse affecting child’s safety).

25. The Court also has the authority and obligation to fashion parenting-time orders that protect the child’s safety while preserving, where appropriate, an ongoing relationship with both parents, which can include supervised visitation or conditions limiting the parent’s use of alcohol or other substances during parenting time. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, § 31; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. at 189–90.

26. A material and substantial change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification does not require proof of catastrophic harm; it is enough that new facts or developments create a genuine and significant concern about the child’s welfare under the existing order. See Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 332–33 (2010) (modification appropriate where circumstances changed and existing order no longer served child’s best interests).

27. Here, the combination of (a) the child’s descriptions of “special drinks” and the Father “can’t walk straight,” (b) objective video evidence of the Father stumbling while handling the child late at night, and (c) school reports of Ethan’s exhaustion on Mondays, demonstrates that the assumptions of stability and safety underlying the 2021 Custody Order have changed materially.

28. These developments directly implicate Ethan’s safety, his need for adequate sleep and routine, and his emotional sense of security, and therefore go to the heart of the best‑interests analysis mandated by G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31, and cases such as Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, and Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590.

29. The Mother does not seek to terminate the Father’s relationship with Ethan, but instead seeks a modification narrowly tailored to protect Ethan by requiring supervision and/or appropriate safeguards during the Father’s overnights, or by restricting overnights until such time as the Father demonstrates sustained sobriety and stability.

30. The requested modification is consistent with the statutory framework and case law that favor ongoing contact with both parents, provided such contact can be made safe and is truly in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

31. The Mother remains willing to foster Ethan’s relationship with the Father in a manner that is safe, structured, and consistent with Ethan’s physical, emotional, and educational needs.

32. Without modification of the current order, Ethan is at ongoing and unreasonable risk of harm due to the Father’s apparent impairment during parenting time and the lack of appropriate structure and rest during weekends with the Father.

LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

33. General Laws c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Court to “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment” regarding custody and parenting time upon a showing of changed circumstances and the child’s best interests.

34. General Laws c. 208, § 31 provides that custody and visitation orders shall be made “in accordance with the best interests of the child,” and that the Court may grant sole or shared legal and/or physical custody and may impose conditions on parenting time as needed.

35. General Laws c. 209C, § 10 (though primarily governing children born out of wedlock) similarly reflects the Legislature’s intent that custody and visitation be subject to modification when required by the child’s best interests, reinforcing the general principle applicable here.

36. The Probate and Family Court’s equitable jurisdiction, including under G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6, empowers it to fashion appropriate, child‑centered remedies and safeguards, including supervised parenting time, substance-use–related conditions, and other protective measures.

37. The Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly emphasized that where a previously entered judgment no longer adequately protects the child’s welfare due to new circumstances, the Court not only may, but should, modify the judgment. See, e.g.:

   a. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. at 189–90;  
   b. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 847–48;  
   c. Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. at 332–33;  
   d. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736–38;  
   e. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 899–900.

38. Under these authorities and the facts alleged above, the Mother has demonstrated a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2021 Custody Order and has shown that modification of the Father’s overnights, and possible related aspects of the custody arrangement, is necessary and appropriate to protect Ethan’s best interests.

RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Sullivan, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and declare that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the September 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time order, particularly regarding the Father’s apparent impairment by alcohol or other substances during parenting time and the resulting impact on Ethan’s safety and well-being.

B. Find and declare that it is in the best interests of Ethan Thompson that the current custody and parenting-time provisions be modified to ensure his safety, emotional security, and consistent rest and routine.

C. Modify the existing custody and parenting-time order to provide that:

   1. The Father’s overnights with Ethan shall be suspended or converted to supervised parenting time at a supervised visitation center or in the presence of a mutually agreed-upon or court‑approved third-party supervisor, until further order of the Court; or, in the alternative,

   2. The Father’s overnights shall continue only subject to specific safety conditions, which may include, but need not be limited to:

      a. A prohibition on the Father’s use of alcohol, marijuana, or other intoxicating substances for a specified period (e.g., twenty‑four (24) hours) before and during all parenting time;  
      b. The Father’s submission to random or scheduled alcohol and/or drug testing as the Court may order, with any positive or refused test resulting in automatic suspension of unsupervised overnights;  
      c. A requirement that the Father comply with any recommended substance‑use evaluation and treatment;  
      d. A requirement that the Father ensure Ethan has an age-appropriate bedtime and adequate sleep during weekends, with Ethan arriving at school rested and on time; and  
      e. Any additional conditions the Court deems necessary to protect Ethan’s safety and best interests.

D. Clarify, reaffirm, or modify legal custody, as the Court deems appropriate under the circumstances and consistent with Ethan’s best interests, including the option of granting the Mother sole legal custody if the Court finds that the Father’s impairment interferes with his capacity to participate safely and reliably in major decision‑making for Ethan.

E. Enter any appropriate temporary orders under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 65, G.L. c. 208, § 28, or the Court’s equitable powers, including temporary restrictions on unsupervised overnights, pending final hearing on this Complaint for Modification.

F. Order that transportation arrangements for Ethan be structured to ensure that he is never transported by a driver who is under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, and that the Father shall not operate a motor vehicle with Ethan as a passenger after consuming alcohol or other substances that could impair his ability to drive safely.

G. Award the Plaintiff such further relief, both temporary and permanent, as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of Ethan Thompson.

Respectfully submitted,

Jessica Sullivan,  
By herself, pro se
