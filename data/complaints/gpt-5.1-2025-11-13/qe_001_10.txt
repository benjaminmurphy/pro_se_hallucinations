### COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”) brings this Complaint against Defendant John Mitchell (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02124.

2. Defendant John Mitchell is an individual who, on information and belief, owns and/or manages the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”), and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, arising from conditions and conduct affecting residential rental premises located in Boston (Dorchester), Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

4. The Boston Municipal Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 1, 19 and applicable jurisdictional statutes and rules because the amount in controversy is within the Court’s jurisdictional limits and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court because the Premises are located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises since on or about January 1, 2022, paying rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,800 per month.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant, as the landlord, was responsible for providing and maintaining heat in the Premises in compliance with Massachusetts law and the State Sanitary Code, including 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., and in particular 105 CMR 410.200 (Minimum Heat in Habitable Rooms).

9. Pursuant to 105 CMR 410.200 and related sections, from September 16 through June 14, the owner of a dwelling must provide and maintain heating facilities sufficient to maintain a minimum temperature of at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and at least 64 degrees Fahrenheit at all other hours.

10. During the winter of 2024–2025, particularly in or about December 2024 through February 2025, the heating system in Plaintiff’s apartment repeatedly malfunctioned.

11. The problem was not a single brief outage; instead, the heat would repeatedly and foreseeably drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, most often in the evening and nighttime hours when Plaintiff was home and attempting to use the Premises for normal residential living.

12. These temperature drops occurred on multiple days and nights over the course of the winter heating season and persisted over a period of weeks, causing the apartment to be uncomfortably and unsafely cold for extended periods.

13. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating problems. Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on two separate occasions.

14. After the first visit, the heating system functioned more normally for approximately one week; thereafter, the recurring temperature drops resumed.

15. On the second visit, the repair technician informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and stated, in substance, that there was not much more that could be done.

16. Despite these service visits, the underlying heating problem was not effectively corrected and the recurring episodes of low heat in the Premises continued.

17. Defendant, through his agents and in communications with Plaintiff, has contended that the heat is “working” because it never went completely out and the building was not “freezing.”

18. However, the repeated and prolonged periods during which the apartment temperature dropped to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit constituted a failure to maintain heat in compliance with 105 CMR 410.200 and applicable municipal requirements, and rendered the Premises unfit for their intended use as a safe, habitable dwelling.

19. As a direct result of the insufficient and unreliable heat supplied by Defendant, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and use two portable electric space heaters in order to keep the Premises at a livable temperature.

20. Plaintiff’s use of the space heaters substantially increased her electric utility charges, by approximately $150 per month during the period in which the heat was inadequate.

21. Plaintiff’s increased electric costs were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat in the Premises.

22. The persistently low indoor temperatures also adversely affected Plaintiff’s health. In or about January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis.

23. Plaintiff’s treating medical provider informed her that the bronchitis was likely made worse, aggravated, or prolonged by the cold indoor air and inadequate heating conditions in her apartment.

24. As a result of this illness, Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work and incurred out‑of‑pocket medical expenses, including the cost of antibiotics.

25. The recurring loss or serious reduction of heat in the Premises, combined with Defendant’s failure to resolve the problem after notice, substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

26. Plaintiff experienced physical discomfort from the cold, disruption of daily living, anxiety about her health and the safety of the Premises, and financial strain from increased utility costs and medical expenses.

27. Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises was materially and substantially impaired because she could not comfortably and safely live in her home during the winter months due to the repeated heating failures.

28. Plaintiff’s tenancy and right to quiet enjoyment are protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

29. The failure to maintain adequate heat in compliance with the State Sanitary Code constitutes an unlawful interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

30. Defendant’s continuing failure, after notice, to correct the chronic heating deficiencies amounted to at least negligent, and in the circumstances reckless or willful, disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and of his statutory obligations as a landlord.

31. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to: (a) increased electric bills for space heaters; (b) medical expenses; (c) lost wages or income from missed work; and (d) loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, inconvenience, and discomfort.

32. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her total actual and consequential damages at approximately Six Hundred Dollars ($600), exclusive of statutory multiples, interest, costs, and fees.

---

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

33. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully set forth herein.

34. Massachusetts law implies into every residential lease a covenant of quiet enjoyment. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

35. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is liable where he “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” including through acts or omissions that render the premises unsafe, unfit, or substantially less usable for their intended residential purpose.

36. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that significant or repeated violations of the State Sanitary Code or other serious conditions affecting habitability can constitute an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
   a. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where conditions and failures to repair substantially impaired tenant’s use of premises);  
   b. *Hemingway v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing landlord’s responsibility for maintaining habitable premises and link to tenant remedies);  
   c. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liability for interference with quiet enjoyment even without direct intent, where interference is a natural consequence of landlord’s actions or omissions);  
   d. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord liable for persistent unsanitary conditions and violations of code affecting quiet enjoyment);  
   e. *Hermida v. Archstone*, 826 F. Supp. 2d 380 (D. Mass. 2011) (recognizing state‑law quiet enjoyment and habitability claims where building conditions substantially interfere with occupancy);  
   f. *Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc.*, 437 Mass. 708 (2002) (reaffirming that landlord obligations under G.L. c. 186 include maintaining premises in accordance with Sanitary Code).

37. The duty to provide adequate heat is a core component of maintaining habitable premises and of a tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment. See 105 CMR 410.200; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A, 127B (authorizing adoption and enforcement of housing sanitary code standards, including heating requirements).

38. Massachusetts courts have further recognized that persistent failure to supply adequate heat or other essential utilities, particularly during winter months, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:  
   a. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord’s failure to remedy serious Sanitary Code violations, including defective heating, supported tenant defenses and damages);  
   b. *McKenna v. Begin*, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 168 (1975) (serious defects and lack of compliance with code requirements, including heat, may amount to breach of implied warranty and quiet enjoyment);  
   c. *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (rescript) (affirming damages for landlord’s failure to correct conditions affecting habitability and quiet enjoyment).

39. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, had a statutory and common‑law duty to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and to ensure that the Premises were fit for human habitation, including providing sufficient heat during the winter.

40. Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate and reliable heat in the Premises, resulting in repeated temperature drops to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for hours at a time during the winter heating season, constituted a violation of the State Sanitary Code and rendered the Premises unfit, unsafe, and substantially less usable for ordinary residential purposes.

41. Defendant’s failure to take effective corrective action after being notified of the heating problem—despite having the ability to repair or replace the boiler or otherwise ensure code‑compliant heat—constitutes at least a negligent, and in the circumstances reckless or willful, interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

42. The inadequate heat, recurring over a prolonged period despite Plaintiff’s complaints, directly and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, causing her physical discomfort, health problems, and the need to incur additional expenses to counteract the cold conditions.

43. Defendant’s conduct and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages, including increased electrical costs for space heaters, medical expenses, lost wages or income, and damages for loss of use and enjoyment, inconvenience, and discomfort.

44. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

45. Three months of Plaintiff’s rent at $1,800 per month equals $5,400.

46. Plaintiff’s actual damages, exclusive of statutory multiples, are reasonably estimated at approximately $600; three months’ rent is greater than Plaintiff’s claimed actual damages.

47. Accordingly, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the greater of her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, plus interest, costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just.

48. Plaintiff additionally seeks any equitable or injunctive relief the Court finds appropriate to prevent further interference with her quiet enjoyment, including orders requiring Defendant to maintain the heating system in full compliance with the State Sanitary Code and applicable law, although Plaintiff’s primary relief requested is monetary.
