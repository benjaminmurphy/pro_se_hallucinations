v.  

MICHAEL TURNER,  
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Turner (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the biological mother of the minor child, Emily Turner (date of birth omitted for privacy; currently age 10).

2. The Defendant, Michael Turner, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the biological father of the minor child, Emily Turner.

3. This Court, the Worcester Probate and Family Court, has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A; and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable), as this is the court that issued the existing custody and parenting-time orders and the parties and child reside in Massachusetts.

4. On or about March 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child Emily Turner (the “2018 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2018 Judgment, primary physical custody / primary residence of the minor child was awarded to Father, with Mother receiving limited weekend parenting time and one mid‑week dinner visit.

6. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, the parenting-time arrangement was based in substantial part upon Mother’s then‑existing circumstances, including:
   a. Mother’s enrollment in a graduate school program with a demanding and inflexible academic schedule;  
   b. Mother’s residence in a small studio apartment not well suited for overnights with a young child; and  
   c. Mother’s then‑limited ability to provide consistent overnight care during the school week.

7. The minor child, Emily Turner, has resided in Massachusetts for more than six months prior to the filing of this Complaint, and this Court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction regarding custody and parenting time pursuant to the Massachusetts child custody jurisdiction statutes and the principles reflected in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), G.L. c. 209B.

### II. STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

8. Under Massachusetts law, a prior custody or parenting-time judgment may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is necessary to serve the present best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 842–843 (2003); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981).

9. The “best interests of the child” is the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination or modification. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–226 (1998).

10. Parenting-time orders are subject to revision where the current arrangement no longer reflects the realities of the parties’ circumstances or the developmental needs and best interests of the child. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 551–552 (2010); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 270–271 (2001).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

11. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there have been substantial, material, and continuing changes in circumstances affecting both Mother and the minor child such that the current custodial and parenting-time arrangement is no longer in the child’s best interests.

12. Mother has completed the graduate program that significantly constrained her time and availability at the time of the 2018 Judgment.

13. Mother is now stably employed in a position with regular, predictable, and normal daytime work hours, which allows her to be consistently available to care for the child on school nights, weekends, and holidays.

14. Mother’s work schedule now provides her with sufficient flexibility to:
   a. Transport the child to and from school;  
   b. Attend the child’s medical, educational, and therapeutic appointments; and  
   c. Participate in the child’s extracurricular and school-related activities.

15. Since the 2018 Judgment, Mother has moved from a small studio apartment into a two‑bedroom apartment located within a reasonable distance of the child’s school and Father’s residence.

16. In Mother’s current two‑bedroom apartment, the child, Emily, has her own bedroom and dedicated space, which is suitable for regular overnights, school-night routines, homework, and age‑appropriate activities.

17. Mother’s housing situation is stable, safe, and appropriate, and it now fully supports the child’s overnight and extended parenting time with Mother.

18. The minor child has grown from approximately age four at the time of the 2018 Judgment to age ten at the time of this filing, a significant developmental change that affects her needs, autonomy, school obligations, relationships, and ability to express her preferences. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–842 (recognizing that as children grow older, their needs and circumstances change in ways that may warrant modification).

19. Over the last several years, Mother and the child have developed a closer, stronger, and more secure parent‑child relationship, with increasing emotional attachment and mutual reliance.

20. The minor child is now of sufficient age and maturity to express her wishes regarding the amount of time she spends with each parent, and her views are entitled to due weight in assessing her best interests. See Adoption of Arthur, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 915 (1993) (child’s preferences may be considered in best‑interests analysis); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 599.

21. The child is engaged in therapy with a licensed mental health professional. According to the child’s therapist, the child has expressed feelings of sadness and guilt about having to leave Mother after short visits and has expressed a clear desire to spend more time, including additional overnights, with Mother.

22. The child has expressed to Mother—and, upon information and belief, to her therapist—that the limited parenting time with Mother causes emotional distress and that she feels “guilty” and “torn” when transitioning away from Mother after short visits.

23. The child has written a letter addressed to the Court indicating her desire to have more overnights and extended time at Mother’s residence, thereby further reflecting her sincere and considered preference for an increased parenting-time schedule with Mother.

24. The child’s expressed wishes are reasonable, age‑appropriate, and consistent with the developmental benefits of having frequent and meaningful contact with both parents where safe and appropriate. See Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183–184 (2006) (recognizing the importance of fostering a child’s relationship with both parents).

25. Despite these changes and the child’s clear and repeatedly expressed wish to spend more time with Mother, Father has refused to engage in meaningful discussion regarding any modification of the parenting schedule.

26. When the child has raised the issue of wanting more time with Mother, Father has become angry or upset, which, upon information and belief, causes the child additional stress and confusion.

27. Father’s refusal even to consider adjustments to the parenting schedule in light of Mother’s improved circumstances and the child’s developing needs and preferences has created tension for the child, contrary to the child’s emotional well‑being.

28. The combined effect of: (a) Mother’s completion of her education, (b) Mother’s secure and stable employment with regular hours, (c) Mother’s improved housing with a dedicated bedroom for the child, (d) the child’s increased age and maturity, (e) the strengthened bond between Mother and child, and (f) the child’s clearly expressed desire for more time with Mother, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances which was not contemplated at the time of the 2018 Judgment.

29. These changed circumstances are continuing, not temporary, and they directly impact the best‑interests analysis with respect to physical custody, parenting time, and the allocation of parental responsibilities. See Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507, 512–514 (2013) (material and substantial change must relate to child’s welfare and best interests).

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

30. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, in allocating or modifying custody and parenting time, the Court must consider the best interests of the child, including but not limited to the child’s age, needs, relationship with each parent, the parties’ capacity to provide for the child’s welfare, and the stability of the child’s home environments. See also Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–843; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596.

31. Mother is now fully able to meet the child’s daily needs, including providing a safe and stable home, assisting with schoolwork, attending to medical and therapeutic care, and supporting the child’s emotional and social development.

32. Increasing the child’s parenting time with Mother—including regular overnights and expanded weekend and/or weeknight time—will foster the child’s relationship with Mother, provide the child with additional emotional support, and better align the schedule with the child’s expressed preferences and developmental needs.

33. The current limited schedule, designed when the child was four and Mother’s circumstances were constrained by graduate school and inadequate housing, no longer reflects the reality of the parties’ situations or the child’s best interests at age ten.

34. A more balanced parenting-time arrangement that includes additional overnights with Mother will:
   a. Allow the child to develop and maintain a strong, ongoing bond with Mother;  
   b. Reduce the child’s feelings of guilt and sadness around transitions;  
   c. Provide the child with a sense of stability and routine in both households; and  
   d. Promote the child’s emotional well‑being and overall adjustment.

35. Massachusetts law recognizes the importance of a child having frequent and continuing contact with both fit parents, where consistent with the child’s welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 183–184.

36. Mother is a fit and loving parent, and nothing in the 2018 Judgment or since suggests that Mother poses any risk to the child; to the contrary, the limitation on Mother’s time at the time of the 2018 Judgment arose from practical constraints (graduate school and housing), not unfitness or misconduct.

37. Courts in Massachusetts recognize that when a parent’s circumstances materially improve—such as obtaining stable housing, securing regular employment, and demonstrating consistent involvement with the child—those changes may warrant modification of prior restrictive parenting-time orders. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 551–552; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 270–271.

38. Continuation of the existing restricted schedule, in light of Mother’s significantly improved situation and the child’s clear wish for more time, fails to maximize the child’s opportunity to benefit from a meaningful and substantial relationship with both parents.

39. Modification of the parenting schedule is necessary to align the Court’s orders with current conditions and to promote the child’s welfare, stability, and developmental needs. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. at 512–514.

40. Any concerns that an expanded schedule might disrupt the child’s schooling or routine can be addressed by structuring the modified parenting plan to preserve school stability, homework time, and extracurricular activities, while still providing additional overnights and extended contact with Mother.

41. A revised parenting schedule that increases the child’s overnights with Mother, including on school nights, can be fashioned to minimize transitions during the school week, provide clear transportation responsibilities, and maintain consistency regarding the child’s schooling and therapeutic services.

42. On information and belief, there have been no material negative changes in Father’s circumstances that would independently warrant a reduction of his parenting time on grounds of unfitness or risk; the requested modification is driven by Mother’s improved capacity, the child’s developmental changes, and the child’s best interests in having more balanced time between both parents.

43. The requested modification seeks to preserve Father’s important role in the child’s life while appropriately increasing Mother’s parenting time so that the Orders better reflect the child’s current needs and best interests.

44. The relief requested herein is consistent with the statutory framework and caselaw governing modification of custody and parenting-time orders in Massachusetts, including G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (if applicable); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507 (2013); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); Adoption of Arthur, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 914 (1993); and Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

45. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Judgment to reflect the material changes in circumstances and the child’s best interests, specifically by increasing Mother’s parenting time and overnights with the minor child Emily Turner.

46. Mother requests that the Court enter a modified Order that, at a minimum, provides for:
   a. Substantially increased parenting time with Mother, including regular overnights each week;  
   b. Expanded weekend time with Mother, such as alternating or otherwise expanded weekends with overnights; and  
   c. Additional vacation, holiday, and school‑break time with Mother, to be equitably shared between the parties.

47. Mother further requests that the modified Order:
   a. Establish a clear and detailed parenting-time schedule that addresses weekdays, weekends, holidays, school vacations, and summer periods;  
   b. Allocate transportation responsibilities between the parties in a fair and workable manner; and  
   c. Include any additional provisions the Court deems necessary to support smooth transitions and reduce conflict between the parties.

48. To the extent necessary, Mother asks that legal custody and decision‑making remain joint (if currently joint) or be allocated in a manner the Court deems appropriate, while recognizing and preserving Mother’s increased involvement in the child’s life and day‑to‑day care.

49. Mother requests that the Court, in its discretion, consider the child’s preferences as to schedule and overnights, in a developmentally appropriate way and consistent with the child’s emotional well‑being, through in‑camera interview, guardian ad litem, or any other method the Court finds suitable.

50. Mother requests that each party be ordered to support the child’s relationship with the other parent and to refrain from disparaging the other parent in the child’s presence, consistent with the child’s best interests and emotional health.

51. Mother requests that, to the extent the Court finds it appropriate, the parties be ordered to participate in co‑parenting education or other services that may reduce conflict and promote cooperative decision‑making in the child’s interests.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and adjudicate that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the March 15, 2018 custody and parenting‑time judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related caselaw;

B. Find and adjudicate that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time orders is necessary and appropriate to serve the present best interests of the minor child, Emily Turner, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the cases cited herein;

C. Enter a Modified Judgment or Order granting Mother substantially increased parenting time with the minor child, including regular overnights and expanded weekend and holiday time, and setting forth a clear, detailed parenting schedule consistent with the child’s best interests;

D. Order that the parties share holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time in an equitable manner, with specific dates and times to be established by the Court;

E. Order that the parties share transportation responsibilities for exchanges of the child as the Court deems fair and appropriate;

F. Order that each party encourage and foster a positive relationship between the child and the other parent and refrain from conduct that undermines the child’s relationship with the other parent;

G. Order such further terms and conditions as may be necessary to minimize conflict and promote the child’s stability and emotional well‑being, including, if the Court deems appropriate, co‑parenting education or related services;

H. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
