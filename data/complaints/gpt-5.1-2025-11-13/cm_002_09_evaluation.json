L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), again respecting and not disturbing the mother\u2019s decision to relocate. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003)... The court concludes, and I concur, that the judge had no authority to issue an order during the pendency of litigation for the child (and hence the mother) to move back to Massachusetts."

It does not discuss geography, travel burdens, schooling logistics, or similar practical schedule problems as a basis for adjusting parenting time.
