See Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251, 254 (1935). Whether negligent conduct is the proximate cause of an injury depends not on factual causation, but rather on whether the injury to the plaintiff was a foreseeable result of the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct. Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978). In this respect, proximate cause prevents liability from being based on factual causation alone.\u201d"

Laws ch. 93A, and briefly notes that Gonzalez experienced \"various physical pains,\" but it does not separately identify, analyze, or label \"loss of enjoyment of life\" as a distinct element or component of pain and suffering damages. The case is primarily about intentional infliction of emotional distress and consumer protection remedies, not about recognizing loss of enjoyment of life as a category of damages. As such, it does not clearly support the specific proposition that plaintiff has suffered and will suffer loss of enjoyment of life arising from defendant\u2019s negligence.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"As a consequence of this conduct, Gonzalez became frightened of Haddad, and she felt 'angry, alone, helpless ... withdrawn ... [and] spent extended periods alone in her room, often crying.' Gonzalez also experienced 'various physical pains which may be reasonably attributable to the tensions and stress caused by her living conditions.' In these circumstances... the judge was justified in concluding that Gonzalez had made out a common law case of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\""
