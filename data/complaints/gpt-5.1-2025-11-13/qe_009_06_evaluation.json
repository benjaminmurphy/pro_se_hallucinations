However, the decision does not interpret or apply G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, nor does it involve or focus on failure to correct serious defects in utilities essential to the premises; rather, it concerns noise from a lounge leased by the landlord.

The court explicitly states that the Legislature, by using the \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 language, incorporated these cases and that malicious intent is not required, at least where the landlord\u2019s conduct is reckless and causes substantial interference.

While the facts involve heat rather than electrical service, the reasoning is framed broadly in terms of failure to furnish an essential service that seriously impairs the character and value of the premises, so it logically extends to other essential building systems like electricity.
