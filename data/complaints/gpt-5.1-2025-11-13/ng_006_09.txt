CIVIL ACTION NO. _____________

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE
-----------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Michael Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Jason Reynolds (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Michael Thompson is an adult individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Jason Reynolds is an adult individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was operating a motor vehicle in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for negligence arising from a bicycle–motor vehicle “dooring” collision that occurred on May 15, 2023, at or near 123 Elm Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02108.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County because the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On May 15, 2023, at approximately [time unknown], Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bicycle lane on a public street in Boston, Massachusetts, in the vicinity of 123 Elm Street.

7. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was riding with the flow of traffic, obeying traffic control devices, traveling within the designated bike lane, and exercising due care and reasonable prudence.

8. Plaintiff was wearing an appropriate bicycle helmet and otherwise acting as a reasonably prudent bicyclist under the circumstances.

9. At the same date, time, and location, Defendant was operating or had just operated a motor vehicle used for rideshare purposes and was stopped or parked in a loading zone directly adjacent to the marked bike lane at or near 123 Elm Street.

10. Defendant stopped his vehicle in the loading zone directly alongside the bicycle lane and, without first ensuring that it was safe to open the driver’s side door, suddenly and forcefully opened his door into the bike lane.

11. Defendant failed to look in his rearview or side mirrors, failed to look over his shoulder, and failed otherwise to ascertain that the bike lane and adjacent area were clear of oncoming bicyclists before opening his door.

12. As Plaintiff was lawfully riding past Defendant’s vehicle in the bike lane, Defendant abruptly opened the driver’s side door into Plaintiff’s path of travel.

13. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision; he had no time to stop or safely swerve due to the sudden and unexpected opening of the vehicle door directly in front of him in the bike lane.

14. Plaintiff’s bicycle collided with the edge of Defendant’s opened door. The force of the impact caused Plaintiff to be thrown from his bicycle and onto the pavement.

15. Plaintiff suffered immediate physical injuries, including, but not limited to, road rash and abrasions on his arms and legs, and trauma to his mouth and teeth, including a chipped front tooth.

16. Plaintiff also suffered property damage, including a bent and damaged bicycle frame and related bicycle components that required replacement.

17. At the scene of the collision, Defendant admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking or looking at his phone at or around the time he opened his vehicle door.

18. Defendant’s statements at the scene constitute admissions of fault and demonstrate that Defendant was distracted and failed to exercise reasonable care before opening his vehicle door into a marked bicycle lane.

19. After the incident, Plaintiff sought necessary medical and dental evaluation and treatment for his injuries, including treatment for road rash and dental procedures related to his chipped front tooth.

20. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical and dental expenses arising out of the injuries caused by Defendant’s conduct.

21. Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting medical treatment caused him to miss work and lose approximately $800 in wages.

22. Plaintiff also incurred costs to replace his damaged bicycle, and suffered other property damage and incidental expenses associated with the collision.

23. Plaintiff reported and/or pursued a claim with Defendant’s automobile insurer following the incident.

24. Plaintiff is informed and believes that, in communications with his insurer, Defendant falsely claimed that Plaintiff had been “weaving in and out of traffic.”

25. Plaintiff denies that he was weaving in and out of traffic. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was riding in a straight and predictable manner within the marked bicycle lane, in compliance with Massachusetts traffic laws.

26. No act or omission by Plaintiff caused or contributed to Defendant’s sudden opening of the door into the bike lane, and Plaintiff did not have a reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision once the door was opened.

27. At all relevant times, there was a marked bicycle lane adjacent to the curb and/or parking/loading zone at or near 123 Elm Street, and Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that bicyclists would be traveling in that lane.

28. Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid opening his vehicle door into the path of approaching bicyclists using the bike lane.

29. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things, failing to look for oncoming bicycles, opening the door directly into the marked bike lane, being distracted by his phone, and failing to ensure it was safe before opening the door.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury, dental injury, pain and suffering, lost wages, medical and dental expenses, property damage, loss of enjoyment of life, and other damages.

31. Plaintiff continues to suffer pain, discomfort, inconvenience, and other consequences as a result of the collision and his injuries.

### IV. APPLICABLE LAW

32. Under Massachusetts law, all operators of motor vehicles owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable injury to others using the public ways, including bicyclists. See, e.g., Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (discussing general negligence principles and duty of reasonable care); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 283 (standard of conduct of reasonable person), as cited with approval in multiple Massachusetts negligence decisions.

33. A bicyclist traveling in a designated bicycle lane has the rights and duties of the driver of any other vehicle, except as to special regulations. See G.L. c. 85, § 11B(2) (bicyclists have the right to use all public ways except limited access highways, and shall be subject to the traffic laws and regulations of the Commonwealth).

34. G.L. c. 85, § 11B further reflects the Commonwealth’s policy of protecting bicyclists as lawful users of the road and imposes duties on others to share the road safely with bicyclists.

35. It is well established that motorists owe a duty of care to bicyclists using the roadway, and that a driver who fails to look for a bicyclist before opening a car door into the bicyclist’s path may be found negligent. See generally Mass. Superior Court and Appeals Court decisions applying ordinary negligence principles to vehicle–bicycle collisions, e.g., Morin v. AutoZone, Inc., 79 Mass. App. Ct. 39, 43–44 (2011) (discussing foreseeability and duty of reasonable care in premises/vehicle context); Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990) (reasonable care under all the circumstances).

36. Massachusetts courts define negligence as the failure to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (duty and breach analysis in negligence case); Flood v. Southland Corp., 416 Mass. 62, 66 (1993) (standard of reasonable care); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 56–57 (1983) (duty of reasonable care grounded in foreseeability of harm).

37. Where a defendant’s negligence is a substantial factor in bringing about a plaintiff’s injuries, the defendant is liable for the resulting damages. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (causation in negligence); Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251, 255–56 (1935) (negligent act that sets in motion foreseeable harm creates liability).

38. Massachusetts follows a modified comparative negligence rule. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, a plaintiff’s contributory negligence does not bar recovery if it is not greater than the total negligence of the person or persons against whom recovery is sought; any damages are diminished in proportion to the plaintiff’s comparative fault, if any.

39. The duties of motorists to exercise reasonable care in using public ways arise from both common-law principles and statutes regulating the safe operation and stopping of motor vehicles. See, e.g., G.L. c. 90, § 14 (requiring due care in passing and overtaking and protection of vulnerable road users); G.L. c. 90, § 7 and related provisions (regulating vehicle equipment and safety).

40. Damages recoverable in negligence under Massachusetts law include, inter alia, reasonable medical expenses, lost wages, compensation for pain and suffering, and property damage. See G.L. c. 231, § 85A (prima facie evidence of responsibility of vehicle owner); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 781–82 (1975) (elements of damages: pain and suffering, medical expenses, loss of earning capacity); DiMarzo v. S. & P. Realty Corp., 364 Mass. 510, 515–16 (1974) (personal injury damages).

41. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff is entitled to recover interest on a judgment in a tort action from the date of commencement of the action. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in actions for personal injuries).

42. The above‑cited statutes and cases, including but not limited to G.L. c. 212, § 3; G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2; G.L. c. 85, § 11B; G.L. c. 90, § 14; G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85, 85A; and the decisions in Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); Flood v. Southland Corp., 416 Mass. 62 (1993); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312 (2002); Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355 (1990); Morin v. AutoZone, Inc., 79 Mass. App. Ct. 39 (2011); Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251 (1935); DiMarzo v. S. & P. Realty Corp., 364 Mass. 510 (1974); and doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776 (1975), collectively support Plaintiff’s negligence claim and requested relief.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

43. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 42 above as if fully set forth herein.

44. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, stopping, and exiting of his motor vehicle, including a duty to refrain from opening a door into the path of a bicyclist lawfully using a marked bicycle lane.

45. The duty of reasonable care included, but was not limited to, the obligation to:

   a. Check mirrors and otherwise look for oncoming bicyclists and other traffic before opening a vehicle door into the roadway or bike lane;

   b. Refrain from opening a vehicle door unless and until it was safe to do so;

   c. Avoid distractions, including checking or using a cell phone, while engaging in conduct that could endanger others on the roadway;

   d. Recognize and respect the rights of bicyclists to use the roadway and designated bike lanes pursuant to G.L. c. 85, § 11B, and to share the road safely with them.

46. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other acts and omissions:

   a. Opening his vehicle door directly into an active, marked bicycle lane without first determining that it was safe to do so;

   b. Failing to look in his rearview and/or side mirrors and failing to look over his shoulder to determine whether a bicyclist was approaching in the bike lane;

   c. Being distracted by looking at or checking his phone at or around the time he opened his door, as admitted at the scene;

   d. Failing to maintain a proper lookout for bicyclists using the designated bike lane;

   e. Failing to exercise reasonable care and prudence under the circumstances.

47. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that bicyclists commonly traveled in the marked bike lane adjacent to the loading zone on the street where this collision occurred, and that opening a car door into that lane without first checking for oncoming bicyclists created an unreasonable risk of harm.

48. Defendant’s conduct created a foreseeable risk that a bicyclist, such as Plaintiff, would collide with the abruptly opened door and sustain serious personal injuries and property damage.

49. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of the collision with Plaintiff’s bicycle and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including but not limited to:

   a. Road rash, abrasions, and associated pain and scarring on his arms and legs; and  

   b. Dental injuries, including a chipped front tooth, requiring restorative dental treatment.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses of approximately $2,500.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of $800 due to time missed from work during his recovery and treatment.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s bicycle and related equipment were damaged, including a bent frame and other damage, requiring repair or replacement at additional monetary cost.

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff endured and continues to endure conscious physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life.

55. Plaintiff has suffered, and may in the future suffer, further medical and dental expenses, as well as further pain and suffering and other losses, as a result of the injuries he sustained in the collision.

56. Plaintiff was at all relevant times exercising due care for his own safety and was acting reasonably under the circumstances. To the extent that any comparative negligence on Plaintiff’s part is alleged, Plaintiff denies such allegation and asserts that any such negligence was less than the negligence of Defendant and, in any event, that Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages reduced only in proportion to any such comparative negligence under G.L. c. 231, § 85.

57. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on any damages awarded in this action, calculated from the date of commencement of this lawsuit.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Michael Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Jason Reynolds, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury, but believed to exceed $50,000, for:

   1. Past and future medical and dental expenses, including approximately $2,500 already incurred;  

   2. Past and future lost wages and/or loss of earning capacity, including approximately $800 already incurred;  

   3. Past and future pain and suffering;  

   4. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life; and
