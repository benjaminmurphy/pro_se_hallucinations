COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Jessica Morgan (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Reed (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Morgan is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1433@gmail.com.

2. Defendant Thomas Reed is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 011xx (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the landlord‑tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the common law and public policy of Massachusetts relating to the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Springfield District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 et seq., because the Premises are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy for a residential apartment with Defendant for the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (the “Apartment”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Apartment as her home since on or about May 1, 2022.

8. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,600.00 to Defendant for the Apartment.

9. The Apartment is a two‑bedroom residential unit. At all relevant times, one of the bedrooms (the “Office Bedroom”) was used by Plaintiff as a home office for remote work.

10. Approximately six weeks prior to the date of this Complaint, in or around mid‑October 2025, the Office Bedroom lost electrical power.

11. Specifically, the electrical outlets and the overhead light fixture in the Office Bedroom ceased functioning, leaving that room without electricity, lighting, or usable power.

12. The loss of electricity is localized to the Office Bedroom; the remainder of the Apartment has electricity.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical failure in the Office Bedroom.

14. In response, Defendant sent an electrician to the Apartment. The electrician examined the Office Bedroom and informed Plaintiff that the electrical problem would require a “bigger repair” due to issues with the wiring.

15. The electrician, upon information and belief, communicated to Defendant that more extensive work would be required to correct the wiring defect in the Office Bedroom.

16. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that he is “getting quotes” for the necessary work but has stated that repairs are “complicated” due to the building’s old wiring.

17. Despite the passage of approximately six weeks since the loss of electrical service in the Office Bedroom, Defendant has failed to restore electricity to that room or otherwise make it usable for Plaintiff.

18. As a result of the lack of electricity in the Office Bedroom, Plaintiff has been completely unable to use that room as a home office.

19. Plaintiff has been forced to relocate her work activities outside of the Apartment to maintain her employment.

20. To do so, Plaintiff has been working from coffee shops and similar public locations, typically incurring approximately $15.00 per day in coffee and food purchases to secure a place to sit and work.

21. In addition, Plaintiff has obtained a coworking‑space membership to have a functional workspace, at a cost of approximately $150.00 per month.

22. Plaintiff’s office furniture, equipment, and materials are now crammed into the living room of the Apartment, significantly reducing the livable space and causing clutter, inconvenience, and discomfort.

23. The loss of use of a designated bedroom, combined with the resulting crowding of the living room and the need to work outside the home, has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment as her home.

24. Plaintiff has continued to pay her full monthly rent of $1,600.00 during this period notwithstanding the loss of a functional bedroom/office.

25. The electrical failure in the Office Bedroom, and Defendant’s failure to remedy it in a timely manner, constitutes a material interference with the use and enjoyment of a material portion of the leased premises.

26. Massachusetts law requires landlords to maintain rental premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, including the provision of adequate and safe electrical service. See, e.g., G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

27. The failure to maintain safe and functional electrical service in a bedroom for an extended period is a substantial violation of the State Sanitary Code and renders that portion of the Apartment unfit for its intended use.

28. Defendant, having been notified of the defective condition, has unreasonably delayed and failed to take the steps necessary to restore electrical service to the Office Bedroom within a reasonable time.

29. Defendant’s inaction and delay have foreseeably and directly caused Plaintiff to incur out‑of‑pocket expenses and to suffer substantial disruption and loss of the use and enjoyment of a significant portion of her home.

30. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least approximately $1,200.00 in damages to date as a result of Defendant’s failure to remedy the electrical defect and the resulting loss of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to: (a) costs for daily coffee shop expenditures to have a place to work; (b) fees for a coworking space membership; and (c) loss of rental value and use of a bedroom/office.

31. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to increase the amount of damages sought as additional damages accrue, including rent‑based damages for loss of use and enjoyment of the premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing the tenant’s right to undisturbed use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

34. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three month’s rent, whichever is greater,” together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached where the landlord, by action or omission, causes or permits conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment of the premises. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

36. The landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 may arise from negligent or unreasonable failure to repair serious conditions, including violations of the State Sanitary Code, after notice. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

37. Massachusetts courts have held that serious housing code violations and persistent defects affecting the habitability or substantial use of residential premises can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 786–88 (1994); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 400–01 (1982).

38. The duty to provide and maintain safe and functional electrical service is part of the landlord’s obligation to comply with the State Sanitary Code and to preserve the tenant’s right to habitable and usable premises. See G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.351, 410.354 (requiring safe and adequate electrical and lighting facilities); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–01 (1979).

39. A landlord’s prolonged failure to correct a known and serious defect within a reasonable time after notice constitutes an “indirect” interference with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 786–87; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284–85; Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

40. Here, the loss of electricity in the Office Bedroom is a serious defect that has rendered an entire bedroom unusable for more than six weeks, substantially reducing the Apartment’s value and Plaintiff’s ability to use it as intended.

41. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the electrical defect, and Defendant is fully aware that the Office Bedroom lacks functioning electricity and is therefore unfit for normal use.

42. Despite this knowledge, Defendant has failed for an extended period to complete the repairs necessary to restore electrical service to the Office Bedroom, instead merely stating that he is seeking quotes and that the work is “complicated.”

43. Defendant’s failure to timely repair the wiring and restore electricity to the Office Bedroom is unreasonable under the circumstances and constitutes a failure to act within a reasonable time after notice of a serious defect.

44. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to repair, Plaintiff has suffered a substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the Apartment, including, but not limited to:

   a. Complete loss of the use of the Office Bedroom as a bedroom and as a home office;  

   b. Crowding and disruption of the remaining living space due to relocation of office furniture and equipment into the living room;  

   c. The need to incur expenses for coffee shops and coworking membership in order to have a functional place to work; and  

   d. Loss of rental value and diminished enjoyment of the Apartment as a whole.

45. The interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment is substantial and not merely a minor inconvenience. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284–85.

46. Defendant’s conduct and omissions therefore constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, along with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 788; Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

48. Plaintiff also has remedies under related landlord‑tenant doctrines, including the warranty of habitability (see Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973)) and G.L. c. 239, § 8A, but in this action she asserts only a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

49. The damages alleged by Plaintiff, including but not limited to out‑of‑pocket expenditures for alternative workspaces and loss of rental value and use of the Office Bedroom, are “actual and consequential damages” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 104–05.

50. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, monetary losses and non‑monetary harms as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

E. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action, including filing and service fees;
