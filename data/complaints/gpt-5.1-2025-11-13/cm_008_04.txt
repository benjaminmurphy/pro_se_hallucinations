v.  

MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME / LEGAL CUSTODY – SCHOOL ATTENDANCE)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Lee (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is an individual believed to reside in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Emma Johnson, born [year] (presently age 10) (“the Child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6 and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, 31, and related Massachusetts law governing custody and parenting-time orders of the Probate and Family Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the prior judgment regarding custody and parenting time was issued by this Court and the parties and the Child reside within its jurisdiction.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about March 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment (the “Judgment”) governing legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the Child.

7. The Judgment provides, in substance, that:
   a. The parties share joint legal custody of the Child;  
   b. The Mother is the primary residential parent; and  
   c. The Father has substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnight, and the parties are required to cooperate on school-related matters and keep each other informed regarding the Child’s education.

8. At the time the Judgment entered, the Child was doing well in school, her attendance was appropriate, and there were no significant truancy concerns.

### IV. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the Judgment on March 15, 2022, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, including Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); and Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

10. Over approximately the past year, the Father has repeatedly and intentionally kept the Child home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, claiming she “needs a mental health day,” despite there being no medical diagnosis requiring such absences and no documentation from any health-care provider.

11. These Monday absences have occurred regularly and disproportionately on the Father’s Mondays, creating a pattern of unnecessary and unexcused absences from school.

12. The school has issued truancy warnings or similar notices concerning the Child’s excessive absences, putting both parents on notice that the Child’s attendance has become a serious problem.

13. The Child’s academic performance has declined during this same period, as evidenced by decreased grades and lower test scores, which the Mother reasonably believes are linked to the Child’s irregular attendance, missed classroom instruction, and missed support services.

14. The Child has been scheduled for tutoring or academic support sessions that sometimes occur during the Father’s weekend parenting time. The Father has regularly refused or failed to bring the Child to these tutoring sessions.

15. The Father’s refusal to ensure the Child’s attendance at tutoring and to facilitate her participation in scheduled academic supports directly conflicts with the parties’ joint legal custody obligations and the requirement in the Judgment that they cooperate on school matters.

16. The Mother has attempted to communicate with the Father regarding the importance of school attendance, compliance with truancy warnings, and the Child’s tutoring and academic support needs, but the Father has not meaningfully cooperated or changed his behavior.

17. The pattern of keeping the Child home from school on Mondays without any medical necessity, combined with the Father’s ongoing refusal to ensure attendance at tutoring, constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the Child’s welfare, particularly her educational and emotional wellbeing.

18. The current allocation of joint legal custody, coupled with the Father’s Sunday overnight and school‑morning responsibilities, has proven unworkable as to educational decisions and has resulted in significant harm and risk of continued harm to the Child’s academic progress.

19. Because of these changed circumstances, the existing Judgment no longer serves the Child’s best interests, and a modification is necessary to protect and promote her welfare, especially with respect to consistent school attendance and educational stability. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

20. In determining custody and parenting time, the Court’s “paramount concern is the best interests of the child.” Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

21. Massachusetts law recognizes that modification of a custody or parenting-time order is warranted when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification is necessary to serve the child’s best interests. G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002).

22. The Child’s regular school attendance and access to appropriate academic support are central to her best interests, wellbeing, and long‑term development. The Father’s conduct has undermined these interests and has created a pattern of truancy that was not present when the Judgment entered.

23. The Father’s failure to ensure the Child’s attendance in school and tutoring during his parenting time demonstrates that the current joint decision‑making structure as to educational matters is not functioning as contemplated and that the Father is not reliably advancing the Child’s educational interests. See Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 326 (2007) (chronic conflict and inability to cooperate can justify modification of joint legal custody); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

24. The Mother has consistently promoted the Child’s education, ensured school attendance during her custodial periods, responded to truancy warnings, and arranged for tutoring and academic supports.

25. It is in the Child’s best interests that one parent be designated with final decision‑making authority regarding educational and school attendance matters, or, in the alternative, that the Father’s school‑night overnights be modified, so that the Child’s attendance and participation in tutoring are not compromised.

26. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court may allocate decision‑making responsibility to the parent more likely to carry out the Child’s education‑related needs, taking into account the parties’ past and present ability to cooperate in making decisions in the Child’s best interests. See also M.C. v. T.K., 463 Mass. 226 (2012) (emphasizing functional best‑interest analysis over labels).

### VI. FAILURE OF JOINT LEGAL CUSTODY REGARDING EDUCATION

27. Joint legal custody requires that parents be able to communicate and cooperate in making major decisions affecting the Child’s welfare, including education. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–844.

28. Where parents are unable or unwilling to communicate and cooperate effectively, or where one parent consistently fails to effectuate important decisions for the Child, it may be in the Child’s best interests to alter or limit joint legal custody. See Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 326 (2007); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

29. As to educational matters and school attendance, the Father’s repeated disregard for the Child’s need to attend school and tutoring, despite truancy warnings and the evident negative impact on the Child’s academic performance, shows that the current joint authority is not working as intended.

30. The Mother therefore seeks a limited modification that (a) grants her final decision‑making authority over school attendance and education‑related decisions, while otherwise maintaining joint legal custody as appropriate, or, in the alternative, (b) reduces or eliminates the Father’s Sunday overnight or other school‑night parenting time to ensure that the Child is in the Mother’s care on school mornings.

### VII. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

31. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may modify a judgment relative to the care, custody, visitation, and support of minor children upon a showing of a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties and the Child and that the modification is in the best interests of the Child. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

32. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must determine custody and the allocation of decision‑making responsibilities in accordance with the best interests of the child, considering, among other factors, the willingness and ability of each parent to honor and facilitate the child’s education and to encourage and support the child’s relationship with the other parent. See also G.L. c. 208, § 31A (considerations in custody determination).

33. Massachusetts appellate decisions make clear that where circumstances have changed in a way that adversely affects a child’s welfare, including a child’s educational stability and well‑being, modification of custody or legal‑custody arrangements is appropriate. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000); Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

34. The Father’s ongoing pattern of keeping the Child out of school on Mondays and refusing to bring her to scheduled tutoring sessions, notwithstanding truancy warnings and declining academic performance, constitutes the type of substantial and continuing change in circumstances warranting modification.

35. A modification narrowly tailored to address the Child’s educational needs—either by granting the Mother final say over educational decisions or by adjusting the Father’s school‑night overnights—will advance the Child’s best interests without unnecessarily disrupting her relationship with either parent. See M.C. v. T.K., 463 Mass. 226 (2012) (court should craft orders that meet the child’s needs in a practical manner).

### VIII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

36. The Mother does not seek to eliminate the Father’s relationship with the Child. She seeks only such changes as are reasonably necessary to protect the Child’s educational stability and overall best interests.

37. The Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing Judgment as follows:

   a. **Educational Legal Custody / Decision‑Making**  
      That the Court modify joint legal custody as to educational matters so that:  
      i. The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody in general; but  
      ii. The Mother shall have final decision‑making authority regarding the Child’s education, including but not limited to:  
         – School attendance (including whether the Child may be kept out of school on any given day);  
         – Enrollment, placement, and participation in special education, tutoring, or other academic support services; and  
         – Responses to truancy warnings, attendance plans, and other school‑initiated interventions.  

      OR, in the alternative,

   b. **Parenting Time / Sunday Overnight**  
      That the Court modify the Father’s parenting time so that:  
      i. The Father’s Sunday overnight is eliminated and the Child returns to the Mother’s care by a reasonable time on Sunday (for example, by 6:00 p.m.);  
      ii. The Mother shall be responsible for the Child’s preparation and transportation to school on Monday mornings; and  
      iii. Any additional schedule adjustments the Court deems appropriate are made to ensure the Child’s regular school attendance and participation in tutoring or academic support.

   c. **Compliance with School Attendance**  
      That the Court order both parents to comply with all school attendance policies, truancy procedures, and educational plans, and to ensure that the Child attends all scheduled school days and tutoring/academic support sessions, except when the Child is legitimately ill or absent for a documented medical or other legally recognized reason.

   d. **Cooperation and Information Sharing**  
      That the Court order that both parties shall promptly share with each other all communications from the Child’s school, including truancy warnings, report cards, progress reports, academic testing, and notices regarding special services, and shall consult in good faith regarding major educational issues, consistent with the Mother’s final decision‑making authority (if granted).

   e. **Further Relief**  
      That the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper to serve the Child’s best interests.

### IX. NO OTHER PENDING ACTIONS

38. To the best of the Mother’s knowledge, information, and belief, there are no other pending actions involving custody of the minor child in any other court.

### X. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the March 15, 2022 Judgment, specifically relating to the Child’s school attendance, tutoring, and educational performance;

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and/or parenting‑time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the Child’s best interests pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31;

C. Modify the Judgment to grant the Mother final decision‑making authority regarding the Child’s education and school attendance, while otherwise maintaining joint legal custody as appropriate, OR, in the alternative, modify the Father’s parenting‑time schedule to eliminate or limit his Sunday overnight or other school‑night overnights so that the Child is in the Mother’s care on school mornings;

D. Order that both parents shall ensure the Child’s regular attendance at school and all scheduled tutoring or academic support sessions, except for legitimate, documented reasons, and shall comply with all school attendance and truancy requirements;

E. Order that both parents shall share and respond to all school communications and work cooperatively regarding the Child’s education;

F. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the Child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA LEE,
