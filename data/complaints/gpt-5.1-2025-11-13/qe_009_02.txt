EMILY JOHNSON,  
Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  Civil Action No. ___________

MARK THOMPSON,  
Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**


Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”):


## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts. She is a residential tenant of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and has controlled and been responsible for the repair and maintenance of the building systems serving the Premises, including electrical wiring and outlets.


## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 if statutory trebling under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is awarded, and because this is a civil action in which equitable and legal relief are sought for violations of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

5. Venue is proper in the Hampden Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the Premises are located in Hampden County and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

6. This action arises under, inter alia, G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment), and related Massachusetts common law.


## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about May 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8. The tenancy has been, at all relevant times, a residential tenancy at will or by lease, with monthly rent of $1,400, payable to Defendant.

9. At the inception of the tenancy, Plaintiff reasonably understood and expected that both bedrooms and all essential electrical systems within the Apartment would be maintained in good and safe working order and would be suitable for ordinary, residential use.

10. Plaintiff used one of the two bedrooms (the “Office Bedroom”) as a home office for work and study, and she reasonably relied on the electrical outlets and overhead lighting in that room for such use.

11. Beginning approximately six weeks prior to December 1, 2025 (on or about mid‑October 2025), the electrical system serving the Office Bedroom failed.

12. Specifically, the electrical outlets in the Office Bedroom stopped working, the overhead ceiling light ceased to function, and the room was rendered without usable electrical service.

13. The remainder of the Apartment retained electrical service, but the Office Bedroom became effectively unusable as a bedroom or office due to the complete lack of functioning outlets and overhead lighting.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical failure in the Office Bedroom and requested that repairs be made.

15. In response, Defendant sent an electrician to the Premises. The electrician informed Plaintiff and/or Defendant that the condition in the Office Bedroom required a more extensive repair due to underlying issues with the building’s older wiring and electrical system.

16. The electrician’s assessment made clear that a simple, minor fix would not restore electrical service; instead, more substantial work was required to bring the Office Bedroom’s electrical wiring and outlets back to safe, functional condition.

17. Defendant acknowledged that a larger repair would be necessary and told Plaintiff that he was obtaining quotes and that the repair was “complicated” because of the building’s old wiring.

18. Despite having notice of the condition for approximately six weeks and having been informed by a professional electrician that substantial repair was required, Defendant failed and refused to make prompt and effective repairs to restore electrical power to the Office Bedroom.

19. As of the filing date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), the Office Bedroom still lacks functioning electrical outlets and lighting and remains unusable as a bedroom or office.

20. Because of the lack of electricity in the Office Bedroom, Plaintiff has been forced to cease using that room as a home office and has lost the use of one of the two bedrooms for which she pays rent.

21. Plaintiff’s office equipment, furniture, and work materials have been displaced and crammed into the living room area, causing clutter, congestion, and loss of normal living space and rendering the Apartment significantly less comfortable and less suitable for ordinary residential life.

22. The loss of an entire bedroom and dedicated workspace has substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment as a whole.

23. To continue working, Plaintiff has been compelled to work from coffee shops and similar public places, typically incurring approximately $15 per day in required purchases (coffee, food, or other items) in order to have access to adequate electrical outlets, seating, and a workable environment.

24. In addition, Plaintiff has incurred the cost of a coworking space membership of approximately $150 per month to secure a stable workspace with reliable electrical service.

25. During the period of approximately six weeks without electricity in the Office Bedroom, Plaintiff has incurred and continues to incur out‑of‑pocket costs, inconvenience, and disruption to her work and daily life as a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom.

26. Plaintiff has continued to pay full rent of $1,400 per month for the two‑bedroom Apartment, even though one bedroom has been rendered functionally useless for a substantial period of time and despite the significant interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises.

27. Plaintiff estimates that, at a minimum, she has suffered damages of approximately $1,200, exclusive of any statutory trebling, costs, interest, and attorney’s fees, due to: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of one of the two bedrooms; (b) relocation of her work activities to outside venues; (c) out‑of‑pocket expenditures for coffee shop purchases and coworking space membership; and (d) disruption, inconvenience, and diminution in the habitability and livability of the Apartment.

28. Defendant has never offered Plaintiff a reasonable rent abatement, alternative accommodation, or any interim remedy to mitigate the loss of use of the Office Bedroom.

29. Defendant has at all times had the responsibility and duty, under Massachusetts law, to maintain the electrical systems serving Plaintiff’s Apartment in safe and functional condition and to correct serious defects that materially impair the character and use of the leased premises.

30. Defendant’s failure, over a period of weeks, to correct the known and significant electrical defect in the Office Bedroom has caused a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law.


## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

31. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and re‑alleges Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of a tenant’s premises, and a landlord who does so is liable for actual and consequential damages or for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

33. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14 protects tenants from substantial interferences with their tenancy caused by the landlord’s actions or failures to act. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715–19 (1977).

34. Interference with essential services or conditions that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 715–19; *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 283 (1994).

35. Massachusetts courts have recognized that a landlord’s failure to remedy serious defects within the premises, including defects affecting heat, electricity, or basic habitability, can amount to a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982); *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997).

36. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated where the landlord, by act or omission, allows conditions to persist that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, even if the landlord did not subjectively intend to harm the tenant. *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 718–19; *Simon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

37. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code requires landlords to maintain electrical facilities in good repair. See G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.351 (requiring safe, adequate electrical service and outlets in habitable rooms). Material violations of the Sanitary Code may also support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 201–02 (1979).

38. Here, the complete loss of electrical service in the Office Bedroom for approximately six weeks, rendering that bedroom unusable as a sleeping area or office and depriving Plaintiff of a functional second bedroom, constitutes a serious defect and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s residential tenancy.

39. Defendant had actual notice of the loss of electricity in the Office Bedroom and of the need for significant electrical repair, yet failed for weeks to take adequate steps to remedy the defect and restore electrical service.

40. Defendant’s failure to restore electricity to the Office Bedroom has directly forced Plaintiff to forgo the use of that room, to displace her office equipment into other living areas, and to incur significant out‑of‑pocket costs for alternative workspaces.

41. The cumulative effect of these conditions—loss of use of one bedroom, inability to work from home in that room, disruption of the living room, and the need to pay for off‑site workspace—constitutes a substantial interference with and disturbance of Plaintiff’s right to quietly enjoy the Premises as a two‑bedroom apartment.

42. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an “indirect” interference with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, because Defendant’s inaction and delay in remedying the known electrical defect allowed a substantial, ongoing interference with the tenancy. See *Lowery*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983; *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

43. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is continuing and has occurred over an extended period of time, which Massachusetts courts have held sufficient to trigger liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Simon*, 385 Mass. at 102–06; *Doe*, 417 Mass. at 283.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Office Bedroom over an extended period;

   b. Diminution in the value of the Apartment as a two‑bedroom unit for which Plaintiff continues to pay full rent;

   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for coffee shop purchases made necessary to obtain an alternative workspace with electrical outlets (approximately $15 per day over multiple weeks);

   d. Coworking space membership costs of approximately $150 per month required to secure a functional workspace;

   e. Inconvenience, disruption of daily life, and loss of comfort and peaceful use of the Apartment as a home; and

   f. Other consequential damages reasonably flowing from the interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater. Three months’ rent at Plaintiff’s rent of $1,400 per month equals $4,200.

46. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks statutory damages of at least three months’ rent ($4,200), or her actual and consequential damages trebled as allowed by G.L. c. 186, § 14, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

47. Although Plaintiff is proceeding without counsel at present, G.L. c. 186, § 14 authorizes an award of reasonable attorney’s fees, and Plaintiff reserves the right to seek such fees should she later retain counsel.

48. Plaintiff’s claim for breach of quiet enjoyment is supported by the statutory protections of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and by Massachusetts decisions recognizing that substantial, ongoing defects affecting essential services in a rental unit—such as lack of adequate heat, water, or electricity—constitute a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 715–19; *Simon*, 385 Mass. at 102–06; *Al‑Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–52; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 201–02; *Lowery*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983; *Doe*, 417 Mass. at 283.

49. Plaintiff’s claim is further consistent with Massachusetts’ public policy of ensuring safe, habitable rental housing and protecting residential tenants from substantial interference with their-tenancy due to a landlord’s failure to correct serious conditions, as reflected in G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; G.L. c. 186, §§ 14, 15F; and cases such as *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 196–98 (1973), which recognize the landlord’s non‑waivable duty to provide premises that meet basic standards of habitability and essential services.


## V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
