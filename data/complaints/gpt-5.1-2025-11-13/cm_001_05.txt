COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

**INTRODUCTORY ALLEGATIONS**

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Smith (“Mother”), resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emily Smith (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Noah Smith (date of birth: __________, age 6) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, James Smith (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, because this is a Complaint for Modification of an existing custody and parenting time judgment of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, and both parties and the Children reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. A Judgment or Order regarding legal and physical custody and parenting time for the Children was entered by this Court on or about April 15, 2021 (the “Existing Custody Order”).

5. Under the Existing Custody Order, the Mother has primary physical custody of the Children, and the Father has parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week.

6. The Mother brings this Complaint for Modification to alter the existing parenting time schedule to reflect a substantial and material change in the Father’s work schedule and the resulting impact on the Children’s best interests and welfare.

---

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

7. At the time the Existing Custody Order was entered on April 15, 2021, both parties worked regular daytime schedules, which allowed the Father to exercise consistent and meaningful parenting time on his designated overnights without significant conflict with his employment.

8. Since entry of the Existing Custody Order, there has been a substantial and material change in the Father’s circumstances. Specifically, the Father has taken a new job that requires him to work overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM on multiple evenings during the week.

9. The Father’s new overnight work schedule now often coincides with, and directly conflicts with, his court-ordered overnight parenting time, including many of the nights he is scheduled to have the Children overnight during his weeknight and every-other-weekend time.

10. Due to his new schedule and resulting fatigue, the Father has repeatedly failed to exercise his overnights as ordered. Instead, with little or no advance notice, he frequently drops the Children off at the Mother’s residence because he reports being too tired to care for them safely after his shifts.

11. On other occasions, when the Father does not return the Children to the Mother, the Father leaves the Children in the care of his adult roommate, a person whom the Mother scarcely knows and with whom she has no co‑parenting relationship or meaningful information regarding background, training, or suitability to provide primary care during overnight hours.

12. The Children have reported to the Mother that when they are at the Father’s residence after his overnight shifts, they often fall asleep on the couch unsupervised or while the Father is napping or sleeping following his shift, rather than being consistently put to bed and supervised in an age‑appropriate manner.

13. The Father’s overnight work schedule, combined with his resulting fatigue when off shift, has caused instability and unpredictability in the Children’s routine, including last‑minute changes in drop‑off and pick‑up, inconsistent bedtimes, and confusion about where they will sleep on nights designated for his parenting time.

14. The Father’s practice of either (a) returning the Children to the Mother with minimal notice because he is too tired to care for them, or (b) leaving them in the primary care of a non‑parent roommate during what are supposed to be his overnights, means that the existing schedule no longer reflects the reality of the Children’s care and is not in their best interests.

15. The Mother continues to be the primary physical custodian and has consistently made herself available to care for the Children during the Father’s scheduled overnights when he is unavailable or too tired, ensuring that the Children have safe and appropriate supervision, consistent routines, and stable sleeping arrangements.

16. The material changes in the Father’s work schedule and associated parenting practices were not anticipated at the time of the April 15, 2021 order and constitute a substantial change in circumstances, warranting modification of the Existing Custody Order.

**LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION**

17. Under Massachusetts law, “[a] judgment for custody of minor children may be modified when the moving party shows that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and that the modification is in the best interests of the child[ren].” *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226, 231–232 (2012); see also G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

18. General Laws c. 208, § 28 provides, in relevant part, that upon a showing of “changed circumstances,” the Court may make a new judgment modifying any prior judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.

19. Similarly, G.L. c. 209C, § 20 authorizes the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and visitation orders respecting children born out of wedlock upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the child’s best interests.

20. In determining whether to modify custody or parenting time, the Court’s “paramount concern” is the “best interests of the child.” *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–842 (2003); *Adoption of Vito*, 431 Mass. 550, 566–567 (2000).

21. The best‑interests analysis focuses on the particular needs of the children and the ability of each parent to meet those needs, including stability, safety, and the quality of the child’s home environment and relationships. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–849; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–596 (1996).

22. Massachusetts courts recognize that changed work schedules, chronic inability to exercise parenting time as ordered, and instability in the children’s routine can constitute a material change in circumstances justifying modification of an existing custody or parenting schedule. See, e.g., *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 370–372 (1981) (substantial changes in circumstances, including employment and ability to comply with existing order, warrant modification); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 232–233.

23. Where the existing parenting plan is no longer workable in light of a parent’s changed schedule, and where the de facto arrangements differ from the written order, the Court may modify the order to conform to the child’s best interests and the actual circumstances. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 191–192 (1998); *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 801–804 (2013).

24. The Court may also consider whether a parent is relying on third parties to provide primary care during his or her parenting time, and whether such arrangements promote or impair the children’s welfare and stability. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 844–847; *Custody of Zia*, 455 Mass. 327, 333–335 (2009) (stability and consistent caregiving are key best‑interest factors).

25. The duty of the Court to safeguard the welfare of minor children is further grounded in G.L. c. 208, § 31, which provides that custody determinations shall be made “in accordance with the best interests of the child” and directs the Court to consider, among other factors, the child’s relationship with each parent, the child’s adjustment to home and community, and the ability of each parent to provide for the child’s needs.

26. In light of the above principles, where, as here, a parent’s overnight work schedule substantially interferes with his ability to provide consistent direct care during court‑ordered overnights, and where the children’s stability and safety are affected, a modification limiting overnights to times when the parent is actually off work and available is a reasonable and appropriate adjustment. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 231–233; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. at 191–192.

**APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS / BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN**

27. The Father’s current overnight work schedule (approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM several nights per week) constitutes a substantial and material change from the circumstances that existed at the time the Existing Custody Order was entered in April 2021, when both parents worked regular daytime schedules.

28. The Father’s new schedule directly conflicts with his ability to exercise overnights in a manner that meets the Children’s needs for safety, supervision, and routine sleep, because he is often either (a) physically absent at work during the supposed “overnight” parenting time, or (b) extremely fatigued and sleeping or napping when the Children require active and attentive parental care.

29. The Father’s repeated last‑minute cancellations and returns of the Children to the Mother because he is “too tired” to care for them after his shifts, as well as his delegation of primary overnight care to his roommate, demonstrate that the existing order is no longer practical or consistent with the Children’s best interests.

30. The Children’s reports that they regularly fall asleep on the couch while the Father naps or sleeps after his shift, rather than being provided with a stable, supervised bedtime routine, raise legitimate concerns about adequate supervision and the quality of care during these overnights.

31. The resulting instability—frequent last‑minute changes, uncertainty about where the Children will sleep, inconsistent bedtime routines, and reliance on a non‑parent roommate for significant unsupervised care—negatively affects the Children’s sense of security and routine.

32. The Mother, by contrast, remains consistently available to provide direct care during night‑time hours and has, in practice, assumed responsibility for the Children when the Father’s schedule prevents him from exercising his ordered time, thereby preserving the Children’s stability and safety.

33. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 208, § 31, and controlling precedent such as *Custody of Kali*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Adoption of Vito*, and *M.C. v. T.K.*, the Court must give paramount weight to the Children’s best interests, including the need for safe, consistent, and predictable caregiving.

34. A modification that limits the Father’s overnights to nights when he is not scheduled to work overnight, and when he is reasonably rested and available to provide direct supervision, will align the written order with the actual circumstances and better promote the Children’s welfare, while still preserving a meaningful relationship between the Father and the Children.

35. The requested modification does not seek to diminish the Father’s relationship with the Children, but to tailor the parenting schedule so that the Father’s time with the Children occurs during hours when he can be present, alert, and able to care for them appropriately, thereby advancing their best interests in accordance with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the case law cited above.

---

**REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

36. The Mother requests that the Court modify the Existing Custody Order to:

   a. Confirm that the Mother, Rachel Smith, shall remain the primary physical custodian of the Children, with both parties continuing to share legal custody as previously ordered (unless otherwise ordered by the Court).

   b. Modify the Father’s parenting time so that overnight parenting time shall occur only on nights when the Father is not scheduled to work an overnight shift (i.e., not scheduled to work from approximately 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM, or similar hours), and when he is reasonably able to provide direct, awake, and appropriate care for the Children.

   c. Require the Father, at a minimum, to provide the Mother with reasonable advance written notice (by text or email) of his work schedule, including all overnight shifts, on at least a monthly basis (or as soon as his schedule is available), so that the parties can identify in advance which nights are suitable for overnight parenting time.

   d. Specify that where the Father is scheduled to work overnight, or knows he will be too fatigued to provide appropriate care during an overnight, such overnights shall be deemed to be with the Mother, and that the Father shall not delegate primary overnight care to unrelated adult roommates or other third parties without the Mother’s written consent or further order of the Court.

   e. Provide that, to the extent feasible, the Father shall continue to have regular, meaningful parenting time during daytime and evening hours on days he is not working overnight, including but not limited to every other weekend and one weeknight visit, adjusted to ensure that the Children are returned to the Mother in time for a consistent bedtime and school schedule where applicable.

   f. Clarify that both parents shall cooperate in good faith to implement the modified schedule in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Children, and that the parties may, by mutual written agreement, grant additional parenting time to the Father at times when he is off work and able to care for the Children.

   g. Grant such other and further modification of custody and parenting time provisions of the April 15, 2021 judgment as the Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of Emily and Noah.

**NO CHANGE REQUESTED AS TO OTHER PROVISIONS**

37. Except as specifically set forth in this Complaint for Modification regarding custody and parenting time, the Mother does not, by this Complaint, seek modification of any other provisions of the existing judgment or orders, including but not limited to child support, unless such modification is required as a matter of law and practice due to changes in parenting time and is addressed by separate motion or agreement of the parties and the Court.

---

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and rule that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Custody Order on or about April 15, 2021, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law (*M.C. v. T.K.*, *Custody of Kali*, *Rosenberg v. Merida*, *Schuler v. Schuler*, and others cited herein).

2. Find and rule that modification of the custody and parenting time provisions of the Existing Custody Order is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor children, Emily Smith and Noah Smith, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and controlling Massachusetts precedent (*Custody of Vaughn*, *Adoption of Vito*, *Custody of Zia*, *Cooper v. Keto*, etc.).

3. Enter a Modified Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time that:

   a. Confirms the Mother as primary physical custodian and maintains joint legal custody (unless otherwise ordered by the Court);

   b. Limits the Father’s overnight parenting time to nights when he is not scheduled to work an overnight shift and is reasonably able to provide direct, awake supervision and care;

   c. Requires the Father to provide the Mother in advance with his overnight work schedule on a regular basis;

   d. Provides that, where the Father is scheduled to work overnight or is too fatigued to safely care for the Children, the Children shall remain overnight with the Mother, and that the Father shall not delegate primary overnight care to third parties (including roommates) without the Mother’s written consent or further order of the Court;

   e. Establishes a specific, workable schedule of weekend and weeknight parenting time that accounts for the Father’s work schedule and the Children’s need for routine and stability; and

   f. Includes such other provisions as the Court deems necessary to protect the Children’s best interests and to implement the modified parenting schedule effectively.

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
