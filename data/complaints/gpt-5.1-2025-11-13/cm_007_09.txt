COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton (“Lisa” or “Plaintiff”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Thornton (“Michael” or “Defendant”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Thornton, is an individual believed to be residing in Bristol County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, Emma Thornton, born [DOB intentionally omitted here for privacy; to be supplied on filing if required by local practice], age 12 (“Emma” or “the minor child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court previously exercised jurisdiction over the parties and the minor child and entered a custody and parenting-time order on June 15, 2018 (the “2018 Judgment” or “existing custody order”).

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable), and G.L. c. 215, § 6, because:

   a. The original custody and parenting plan was issued by this Court;  
   b. Both parties and the minor child presently reside, or most recently resided, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court; and  
   c. This Complaint seeks modification of an existing custody and parenting order of this Court.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND EXISTING CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT

6. On or about June 15, 2018, the Court entered a final judgment or order governing legal and physical custody and parenting time of the minor child.

7. Under the 2018 Judgment, the parties were awarded shared legal custody and substantially equal physical custody of Emma, on an alternating week basis: one week with the Plaintiff, followed by one week with the Defendant, in a continuing alternating cycle (the “50/50 schedule”).

8. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, both parents lived in reasonably close proximity to one another, were in good health, and were fully capable of independently meeting the minor child’s physical care, safety, and supervision needs in their respective homes.

9. For several years after entry of the 2018 Judgment, the 50/50 schedule functioned as intended: Emma had stable homes with both parents, consistent school routines, and a functional parenting-time schedule that served her best interests.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the care, safety, and best interests of the minor child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

11. Specifically, the Defendant has recently been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition.

12. As a result of this progressive neurological condition, the Defendant has experienced physical limitations, including loss of balance, reduced mobility, and difficulty with transfers and ambulation.

13. The Defendant has fallen several times at home, including during periods when he is the custodial parent under the alternating-week schedule.

14. The Defendant’s healthcare providers have advised, upon information and belief, that he should not be alone with the minor child in situations involving stairs, bathing, or other environments where a quick physical response or adequate physical strength is required to ensure a child’s safety.

15. Despite this medical advice and the progression of the Defendant’s condition, the Defendant insists upon maintaining the identical 50/50 alternating-week custody schedule that was established when he was healthy and physically independent.

16. During the Defendant’s custodial weeks, he sometimes relies on the parties’ twelve‑year‑old daughter, Emma, to assist him with significant physical tasks, including:

   a. Helping him transfer from his wheelchair to his bed;  
   b. Bringing him items or equipment that he cannot safely retrieve himself; and  
   c. Assisting in ways that require Emma to respond to his physical limitations in a quasi‑caregiver role rather than in a developmentally appropriate child role.

17. The Defendant’s progressive neurological condition, repeated falls, and the resulting reliance on the minor child for physical assistance create an unreasonable and unsafe caregiving burden for a 12‑year‑old child and expose her to heightened risk of physical and emotional harm.

18. The current 50/50 schedule, which was appropriate when both parents were healthy, no longer adequately protects the minor child’s safety, emotional well‑being, or developmental needs in light of the Defendant’s deteriorated physical condition.

19. These changes in the Defendant’s health and functioning were not contemplated at the time of the 2018 Judgment and constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

20. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any order concerning custody or parenting time is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

21. The best‑interests standard requires the Court to consider the child’s safety, emotional development, stability, and the capacity of each parent to meet the child’s present needs. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

22. A parenting arrangement that places a child in the role of de facto caregiver to a physically limited parent, in circumstances where that caregiving role is necessitated by serious medical limitations and safety risks, is inconsistent with the child’s best interests and with the statutory mandate to protect the child’s welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).

23. The Defendant’s falls, mobility issues, and need for assistance with basic activities of daily living during his custodial weeks create the risk that Emma could:

   a. Be physically injured while attempting to assist the Defendant;  
   b. Be exposed to emergencies (e.g., falls, inability to summon help) that she is not developmentally or physically prepared to manage; and  
   c. Experience undue emotional stress and anxiety arising from fear for her parent’s safety and from being placed in a caretaking role.

24. In contrast, the Plaintiff is presently able-bodied, capable of independently caring for Emma without requiring the minor child to perform significant physical caregiving tasks, and can provide a stable, safe, and developmentally appropriate home environment.

25. Providing Emma with a primary residence with the Plaintiff, while ensuring ongoing and meaningful contact with the Defendant within the limits of his medical condition and safety considerations, will better serve Emma’s best interests than the current alternating-week 50/50 arrangement. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

26. Continued adherence to the existing 50/50 schedule, in the face of the Defendant’s documented and progressive impairment, undermines the child’s best interests and justifies modification of the custody and parenting-time provisions of the 2018 Judgment. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

27. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the custody of the children or the visitation rights of a parent” upon a showing of “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” and a determination that the modification is in the best interests of the child. See also *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

28. To the extent legal authority under G.L. c. 209C applies, G.L. c. 209C, § 20 similarly authorizes modification of custody and parenting orders when required by the child’s best interests.

29. Massachusetts appellate decisions hold that significant changes in a parent’s health, functional capacity, or ability to provide safe care can constitute a material and substantial change warranting modification of custody or parenting time. See, e.g., *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (upholding modification based on changed circumstances related to stability and capacity to care for child); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (modification proper where prior assumptions about a parent’s caretaking capacity no longer held true).

30. The child’s safety is a core element of the best‑interests analysis. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31; *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986); *Adoption of Larry*, 434 Mass. 456 (2001).

31. By virtue of the Defendant’s progressive neurological condition, his repeated falls, the medical advice limiting the situations in which he should be alone with the minor child, and his reliance on the minor child for physical assistance, the factual circumstances underlying the 2018 Judgment have materially and substantially changed.

32. The continuation of a 50/50 alternating-week physical custody schedule under these changed conditions no longer serves the child’s best interests, and instead exposes the child to undue risk and emotional burden.

33. Modification of the existing custody order to award the Plaintiff primary physical custody, while preserving appropriate and safe parenting time for the Defendant, is a reasonable and necessary adjustment that aligns with the child’s safety needs, emotional well‑being, and developmental interests, consistent with Massachusetts law. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

34. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the 2018 Judgment only as to physical custody and parenting time, and requests that the Court enter an order substantially as follows:

   a. **Primary Physical Custody.** That the Plaintiff be awarded primary physical custody of the minor child, Emma Thornton, such that Emma’s primary residence is with the Plaintiff.

   b. **Legal Custody.** That the parties continue to share legal custody of Emma, unless and until the Court, after hearing, determines that joint legal custody is not in the child’s best interests in light of the Defendant’s medical condition or other factors. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

   c. **Parenting Time with Defendant.** That the Defendant be granted reasonable and liberal parenting time with Emma, structured and scheduled in a manner that:

      i. Takes into account the Defendant’s medical condition and any safety limitations recommended by his treating providers;  
      ii. Does not place responsibility on Emma for physically assisting or supervising the Defendant beyond what is developmentally appropriate for a 12‑year‑old child; and  
      iii. May initially consist of shorter visits, daytime visits, or overnights as safely manageable, including but not limited to:

         • Alternate weekends or selected weekend days with the Defendant, as medically appropriate;  
         • One or more mid‑week dinners or evenings, as medically appropriate; and  
         • Additional time during school vacations, holidays, and summer, to the extent consistent with the Defendant’s health and Emma’s best interests.

   d. **Safety Provisions.** That any parenting‑time order for the Defendant include reasonable safety provisions, such as:

      i. Compliance with any medical restrictions or guidelines regarding the Defendant’s ability to be alone with the minor child in settings that pose heightened risk (e.g., stairs, bathing, activities requiring quick physical response);  
      ii. Use of any recommended adaptive equipment, in‑home assistance, or support persons as available, particularly during any extended or overnight parenting time; and  
      iii. Prohibition against placing on the minor child any substantial responsibility for physically assisting the Defendant with transfers, mobility, or other tasks that are beyond what is typical and developmentally appropriate for a child of her age.

   e. **Communication and Decision‑Making.** That the parties be ordered to communicate regarding Emma’s major educational, medical, and extracurricular decisions in a manner consistent with joint legal custody and the child’s best interests, and to cooperate in sharing relevant information, including but not limited to:

      i. Information regarding the Defendant’s medical restrictions as they relate to Emma’s safety; and  
      ii. Information concerning Emma’s schooling, health, and activities.

   f. **Further Orders as Necessary.** That the Court issue such further orders as it deems just and proper to safeguard the best interests of the minor child and to effectuate a stable and safe parenting plan, including but not limited to:

      i. Clarification of transportation responsibilities;  
      ii. Allocation of holiday and vacation time; and  
      iii. Any orders regarding the exchange of information or use of co‑parenting tools needed to implement the modified schedule.

35. The Plaintiff does not seek to terminate or unduly limit the Defendant’s relationship with Emma, but rather to modify the physical custody and parenting schedule so that Emma can enjoy a safe, stable primary residence with the Plaintiff and continued, meaningful, and safe contact with the Defendant that reflects his current medical realities.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2018 custody and parenting-time order, specifically including the Defendant’s progressive neurological condition, repeated falls, and diminished capacity safely to care for the minor child on a 50/50 alternating-week basis;

2. Find and rule that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order is necessary to serve and protect the best interests of the minor child, Emma Thornton;

3. Modify the 2018 Judgment to award the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, with Emma’s primary residence to be with the Plaintiff;

4. Maintain joint legal custody of the minor child with both parents, unless and until this Court determines, after hearing, that a different allocation of legal custody is in the child’s best interests;

5. Establish a parenting-time schedule for the Defendant that is reasonable, meaningful, and safe, tailored to his medical condition and functional abilities, and that does not place an inappropriate caregiving burden on Emma;

6. Include in any parenting-time order such safety‑related conditions as the Court deems necessary, including any conditions related to supervision, use of support persons, adherence to medical recommendations, and appropriate limitations on Emma’s role in physically assisting the Defendant;

7. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
