COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT  
CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________


JACOB ADAMS,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

LINDA GREENE,  
    Defendant.  


COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE)


Plaintiff Jacob Adams (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Linda Greene (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jacob Adams is a natural person residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present at the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Linda Greene is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and the owner, landlord, and person in control of the three‑unit residential building and the appurtenant sidewalk located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for negligence arising under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, because the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court, and because this is an action in tort.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the cause of action arose in Worcester County, and the Premises at issue are located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Defendant owns, controls, manages, and/or is otherwise responsible for the care, maintenance, and condition of the Premises, including the sidewalk and the primary pedestrian path leading from the public way to the building entrances at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA.

7. The Premises consist of a three‑unit apartment building with a sidewalk that is used by tenants, guests, delivery persons, and other lawful visitors to access the building.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors, including Plaintiff, to maintain the Premises and appurtenant walkways in a reasonably safe condition and to remedy or warn of hazards of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known.  
   See G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).

9. On or about February 13–15, 2023, Worcester, Massachusetts experienced winter weather including snow and freezing temperatures.

10. Following a snowstorm in February 2023 and prior to February 15, 2023, Defendant undertook to clear snow from the sidewalk at the Premises.

11. Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk running from the public way to the building, but failed to apply salt, sand, or other de‑icing or traction materials to that path or the surrounding sidewalk area.

12. Over the course of the next couple of days, daytime temperatures caused the remaining snow and ice in and around the shoveled path to melt, and nighttime temperatures caused the melted water to refreeze.

13. As a result of this melting and refreezing, the shoveled walkway and the primary path of travel to the building became, and remained, a dangerous sheet of ice and an unreasonably slippery condition.

14. Tenants of the Premises experienced and observed the icy, hazardous condition on the sidewalk and on the narrow shoveled path, and they recognized it as dangerous.

15. Prior to February 15, 2023, tenants of the Premises notified Defendant of the icy and dangerous condition of the sidewalk by text message and sent Defendant photographs documenting the icy condition.

16. Upon information and belief, after receiving these notifications and photographs, Defendant responded to tenants by stating words to the effect that “the sun will take care of it,” and failed to take reasonable steps to treat, sand, salt, or otherwise correct or warn of the dangerous ice.

17. Defendant therefore had actual notice of the hazardous ice and the risk it posed to lawful visitors using the sidewalk as the customary means of access to the building.

18. Alternatively, and in addition, Defendant, as owner and person in control of the Premises, in the exercise of reasonable care should have known of the existence of the icy condition through ordinary inspection and maintenance of the Premises.  
   See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783–85 (2007).

19. Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to remove, treat, or otherwise remedy the hazardous ice on the sidewalk, and failed to warn lawful visitors, including Plaintiff, of the condition.

20. On February 15, 2023, at approximately a time during daylight hours, Plaintiff was lawfully present at 123 Maple Street for the purpose of delivering groceries to one of the tenants of the building.

21. Plaintiff approached the Premises and used the sidewalk and the shoveled path provided and maintained by Defendant as the normal and obvious route of pedestrian ingress to the building.

22. While walking on the narrow path that had been shoveled by Defendant, Plaintiff encountered the sheet of ice that had formed on that path due to the melting and refreezing cycle.

23. Without warning, Plaintiff’s feet slipped out from under him on the icy surface, and Plaintiff fell backward violently, landing hard on his lower back on the frozen, icy sidewalk.

24. Plaintiff experienced immediate and significant pain in his lower back as a result of the fall.

25. Shortly after the incident, tenants of the Premises informed Plaintiff that they had previously contacted Defendant about the icy condition of the sidewalk and had sent her photographs, and that Defendant had declined to take corrective action, stating that “the sun will take care of it.”

26. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was using the sidewalk and shoveled path in a foreseeable and reasonable manner and was exercising due care for his own safety.

27. Plaintiff did not create the hazardous condition, did not have superior knowledge of the hazard, and reasonably relied upon Defendant to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition.  
    See *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013).

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of the Premises and sidewalk, Plaintiff suffered an injury to his lower back.

29. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought and received medical evaluation and treatment for his lower back injury.

30. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to diagnosis, treatment, and care of his back injury.

31. As a further result of his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week, causing him to lose approximately $800 in wages.

32. Plaintiff has experienced pain and suffering, discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, and interference with his normal daily activities as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

33. Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, and lost wages were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to use reasonable care to maintain the Premises and sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition.

34. No act or omission of Plaintiff was the sole or predominant cause of his injuries. To the extent any comparative negligence may be alleged, Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was less than that of Defendant and does not bar recovery under G.L. c. 231, § 85.  
    See *Colter v. Barber-Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 61–62 (1988).

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

35. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–34 above as if fully set forth herein.

36. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of real property owes a duty to all lawful visitors to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances.  
    See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995).

37. In *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), the Supreme Judicial Court abolished the prior natural/unnatural accumulation distinction and held that a property owner owes the same duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors with respect to hazards arising from snow and ice as for all other hazards.

38. Pursuant to *Papadopoulos* and related cases, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances, including by taking reasonable steps to inspect, treat, sand, salt, or remove accumulations of snow and ice on the Premises’ walkways and to warn of any remaining unreasonable hazards.  
    See *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 383–84; *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 416 Mass. 825, 829 (1994).

39. Defendant further had a duty, once she voluntarily undertook to shovel the sidewalk, to do so with reasonable care and not to create or leave in place an unreasonably dangerous condition worse than if she had not acted.  
    See *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 52–53 (1983) (duty may arise from voluntary undertaking); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* §§ 323, 324A (cited with approval in Massachusetts).

40. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

    a. Failing to properly and adequately remove accumulations of snow and ice from the sidewalk at the Premises;

    b. Shoveling only a narrow path and leaving that path subject to melting and refreezing without reasonable treatment;

    c. Failing to apply reasonable amounts of salt, sand, or other de‑icing or traction materials to the sidewalk and path;

    d. Failing to monitor, inspect, and maintain the sidewalk at reasonable intervals following winter weather and temperature changes;

    e. Failing to respond reasonably to tenant complaints, text messages, and photographic evidence of the icy and dangerous condition;

    f. Ignoring known hazards and responding that “the sun will take care of it” instead of acting reasonably to protect lawful visitors;

    g. Failing to post warnings, cones, barriers, or signage alerting visitors to the ice hazard; and

    h. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent property owner under like circumstances.

41. Defendant either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the icy and dangerous condition on the sidewalk and the risk it posed to lawful visitors such as Plaintiff.  
    See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783–85 (2007) (notice and reasonable care standard).

42. Defendant’s breach of her duty of reasonable care was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and the injuries he suffered to his lower back.  
    See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (duty, breach, causation, and damages as elements of negligence).

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury to his lower back, incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses, lost approximately $800 in wages, and suffered physical pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

44. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages diminished, if at all, only in proportion to any comparative negligence found, so long as his negligence, if any, was not greater than the total negligence attributable to Defendant.

45. Plaintiff is entitled to recover full and fair compensation for all past and future damages caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and any other compensable losses recognized under Massachusetts law.  
    See *Harlow v. Chin*, 405 Mass. 697, 702–03 (1989); *Shantigar Found. v. Bear Mountain Builders, Inc.*, 441 Mass. 131, 139 (2004).

### V. DAMAGES

46. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:

   a. Approximately $2,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for evaluation and treatment of his lower back injury;

   b. Approximately $800 in lost wages due to being unable to work for about one week following the incident;

   c. Physical pain and suffering associated with the back injury;

   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life;

   e. Interference with normal daily activities and functions; and

   f. Such other and further damages as may be proven at trial.

47. Plaintiff is entitled to recover prejudgment and post‑judgment interest as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B and/or § 6C.

48. Plaintiff is further entitled to his allowable costs and fees as provided by law, including those recoverable as of right in the District Court under G.L. c. 261 and the applicable Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.

---

### VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60 and the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jacob Adams respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Linda Greene, and award the following relief:

A. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, but believed to be within the jurisdiction of this Court, for:

   2. Past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $800 already lost;  
   3. Past and future physical pain and suffering;  
   4. Emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   5. All other consequential and incidental damages permitted by Massachusetts law;
