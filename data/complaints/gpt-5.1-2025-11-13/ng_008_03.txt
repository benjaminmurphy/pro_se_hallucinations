COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
(JURY TRIAL DEMANDED)  

Plaintiff Jessica Harper (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Quincy Dine‑In (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harper is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. On July 15, 2023, and at all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee and paying customer at Defendant’s restaurant located at 245 Washington Street, Quincy, MA 02169 (the “Premises”).

3. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Dine‑In is a business entity organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or another state), operating a restaurant open to the public at 245 Washington Street, Quincy, MA 02169.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, occupied, managed, controlled, and/or operated the Premises, including the hallway between the kitchen and dining area where Plaintiff fell.

5. At all relevant times, Defendant’s employees, agents, and servants—including the server who dropped the tray and the staff who were “dodging” the puddle—were acting within the course and scope of their employment or agency with Defendant, making Defendant vicariously liable for their acts and omissions under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because Plaintiff’s claims arise under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

7. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 223A, because Defendant conducts business within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and this civil action is properly brought in this county as a court of general jurisdiction.  

8. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant exists under Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 223A, § 3, because Defendant regularly transacts business in Massachusetts, operates a restaurant open to the public at the Premises, and Plaintiff’s injuries arise from Defendant’s acts and omissions in Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

9. On or about July 15, 2023, at approximately evening dinner hours, Plaintiff was a paying customer dining at Defendant’s restaurant located at 245 Washington Street, Quincy, MA 02169.

10. Plaintiff was on the Premises at Defendant’s invitation and for Defendant’s benefit, and was therefore a business invitee to whom Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (abolishing common‑law distinctions between invitees and licensees and imposing a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

11. Defendant, through its employees and agents, knew or reasonably should have known that customers, including Plaintiff, regularly used the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room to access the restrooms and other parts of the Premises.

12. On or about July 15, 2023, a server employed by Defendant was carrying a tray with several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.

13. The server dropped the tray, causing multiple water glasses to fall and break, spilling water and ice on the tile floor and scattering broken glass in the hallway.

14. The server quickly picked up the broken glass but left the water and ice on the tile floor, and stated that she would “be right back with a mop.”

15. Despite knowing that there remained a substantial quantity of water and ice on the floor, the server failed to place any warning device, sign, cone, barrier, or other marker to alert customers such as Plaintiff to the wet and slippery condition.

16. Defendant’s employees failed to block off or otherwise restrict access to the wet area of the hallway, even though they knew that customers would likely walk through that hallway.

17. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom and proceeded into the hallway between the kitchen and the dining area.

18. At that time, the hallway floor remained wet from the spilled water and ice, and Defendant’s employees had not returned with a mop, had not cleaned or dried the area, and had not placed any warning sign, cone, or other notice of the hazardous condition.

19. As Plaintiff walked down the hallway, the water on the tile floor caused the floor to glisten such that it was difficult to distinguish from the normal sheen of the tile until Plaintiff was already stepping onto the wet area.

20. Plaintiff, exercising due care for her own safety, stepped into the hallway unaware of the hazardous wet condition.

21. As Plaintiff stepped onto the wet, slippery tile, her foot slipped out from under her, causing her to fall and twist her knee severely.

22. Immediately following Plaintiff’s fall, she experienced acute pain in her knee and difficulty bearing weight.

23. After Plaintiff’s fall, she overheard Defendant’s staff members state that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, indicating that the hazardous wet condition had existed for a significant period of time and that Defendant’s employees were aware of it.

24. The statements by Defendant’s employees demonstrate that Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous condition and failed to timely remedy it or adequately warn customers. See *Oliveri v. MBTA*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (liability where condition existed long enough to have been discovered and remedied in exercise of reasonable care).

25. Defendant and its employees also had constructive notice of the dangerous condition, given that: (a) Defendant’s own employee created the hazard by dropping the tray and leaving water and ice on the floor; and (b) the hazard remained for at least approximately ten minutes, a sufficient time to correct or warn against it. See *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

26. Defendant’s employee’s failure to promptly clean the spill, combined with the failure to post any warning or barrier, created an unreasonably dangerous condition for customers passing through the hallway.

27. At all times material hereto, Plaintiff was acting reasonably and was not engaging in any careless, reckless, or unsafe behavior.

28. Plaintiff did not receive any warning from Defendant’s staff about the presence of water on the floor or about any unsafe condition in the hallway.

29. Plaintiff had no prior knowledge of the spill and no reason to anticipate that the floor would be wet and slippery in the hallway.

30. Following the fall, Plaintiff reported her injury and the incident to Defendant’s staff.

31. As a direct result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a sprained knee.

32. Plaintiff promptly sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a sprained knee.

33. Plaintiff was prescribed and required to use a knee brace for stabilization of the injured joint.

34. Plaintiff also underwent weeks of physical therapy as part of her treatment and recovery.

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500, including but not limited to urgent care visits, diagnostic evaluation, knee brace, and physical therapy.

36. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200, due to her inability to work for a period of time and/or to perform her regular job duties.

37. In addition, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, limitation of activities, and emotional distress as a result of her injury.

38. Plaintiff’s injuries were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to exercise due care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or remedy the known hazard. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–49 (2006).

39. At all material times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to (a) maintain the Premises, including the hallway, in a reasonably safe condition; (b) inspect for and correct hazardous conditions within a reasonable time; and (c) warn lawful visitors, including Plaintiff, of any known or reasonably foreseeable dangers. See *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 707–08; *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 166–67 (1980).

40. Defendant breached this duty of care by, among other things:  
   a. Failing to promptly clean up the water and ice spilled on the floor;  
   b. Failing to place a “wet floor” sign, cone, or other warning in or near the area of the spill;  
   c. Failing to block off or restrict access to the wet hallway until the spill was fully cleaned up and the floor made safe;  
   d. Allowing the hazardous condition to remain in an area where customers were expected to walk;  
   e. Failing to implement or follow reasonable policies and procedures for the prompt clean‑up and warning of spills; and  
   f. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees regarding spill response and customer safety.

41. Defendant’s conduct, through its employees, fell below the standard of care that a reasonably prudent restaurant operator would observe under like circumstances. See *Batchelder v. Allied Stores Corp.*, 393 Mass. 819, 821 (1985).

42. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 548–49 (1982) (causation principles).

43. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action, or such conditions have been waived or excused.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

44. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 43 as though fully set forth herein.

45. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier owes lawful visitors a duty to act as a reasonable person in maintaining the property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all circumstances. *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 707–08; *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 742 (1995).

46. Defendant, as owner, operator, and/or person in control of the Premises, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises, including the hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, in a reasonably safe condition, and to warn of or remedy any unreasonably dangerous conditions that it knew or reasonably should have known about. See *Young*, 380 Mass. at 166–67; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (adopted in *Thurston v. Ballou*, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 741 (1987)).

47. Defendant had actual and/or constructive notice of the dangerous wet condition on the hallway floor because:  
   a. The condition was created by Defendant’s own employee dropping a tray of water glasses and leaving water and ice on the floor; and  
   b. Defendant’s employees admitted they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time before Plaintiff’s fall, showing awareness that the condition existed and posed a danger. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–85 (2007) (notice established where defendant created the hazardous condition).

48. Under Massachusetts law, where the defendant or its employees create the dangerous condition, the plaintiff is not required to prove the length of time the condition existed to establish notice. *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 785–86.

49. Even if Defendant had not created the condition, the water and ice remained on the floor for at least approximately ten minutes, during which time Defendant’s employees knew of the spill and had sufficient opportunity to either clean it up or adequately warn customers, thereby establishing constructive notice under Massachusetts law. See *Deagle*, 343 Mass. at 264–65; *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560, 562 (1955).

50. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, inter alia:  
   a. Failing to promptly and properly clean the water and ice from the hallway floor;  
   b. Failing to place any “wet floor” sign or other visible warning of the danger;  
   c. Failing to cordon off, block, or otherwise restrict access to the hazardous area;  
   d. Failing to take any reasonable steps to protect customers from the known dangerous condition;  
   e. Failing to enforce adequate safety policies regarding spill response; and  
   f. Failing to properly train, instruct, and supervise employees in hazard recognition and customer safety.

51. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused Plaintiff to slip, fall, and sustain injuries. “But for” Defendant’s negligent failure to clean or warn of the spill, Plaintiff would not have been injured. See *Jupin*, 447 Mass. at 147–49.

52. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was acting as a reasonable person under the circumstances, using ordinary care for her own safety. Plaintiff did not see any sign, cone, or warning and had no reason to anticipate that the hallway floor would be wet and slippery.

53. To the extent that Defendant may assert comparative negligence, Plaintiff denies any negligence on her part. In any event, any alleged negligence of Plaintiff was less than that of Defendant and would merely operate to diminish, but not bar, recovery pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85. See *Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 61–62 (1988).

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, including but not limited to a sprained knee, pain and suffering, functional limitations, and inconvenience.

55. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses for urgent care, diagnostic services, a knee brace, and physical therapy in the approximate amount of $2,500, and may incur additional medical expenses in the future.

56. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained lost wages and diminished earning capacity in the approximate amount of $1,200.

57. Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life due to her injuries. See *Ferriter v. Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, Inc.*, 381 Mass. 507, 513 (1980).

58. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from Defendant for all injuries and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other consequential damages, pursuant to the common law of negligence in Massachusetts and G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B–6C (pre‑ and post‑judgment interest). See *Kitner v. CTW Transport, Inc.*, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 741, 743–44 (2002).

### V. DAMAGES

59. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 58 as if fully set forth herein.

60. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages including, but not limited to:

   a. Past medical expenses in an amount presently estimated at approximately $2,500;  
   b. Future medical expenses reasonably likely to be incurred for follow‑up treatment and potential additional therapy;  
   c. Lost wages in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,200;  
   d. Diminished earning capacity, to the extent her injury affects her ability to work;  
   e. Physical pain and suffering, both past and future;  
   f. Loss of enjoyment of life, limitations on daily activities, and inconvenience; and  
   g. Emotional distress and mental anguish.

61. Plaintiff seeks an award of monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, together with pre‑ and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law under G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, and costs of this action.

---
