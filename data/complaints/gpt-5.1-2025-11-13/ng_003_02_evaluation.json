Ellard is a Massachusetts case that abolishes the common\u2011law distinction between invitees and licensees and holds that landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. While the excerpt provided is only Kaplan\u2019s concurrence and focuses on trespassers, the main opinion at 363 Mass. 693, 707 expressly states that occupiers must exercise reasonable care toward lawful visitors, which includes business invitees on premises open to the public. Thus, the case generally supports the proposition that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to a lawful business invitee, though it does not speak specifically about retail aisles and shelving.",

The proper test is whether, in the management of his property, the occupier has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others. In short, the occupier of land owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors.\""
