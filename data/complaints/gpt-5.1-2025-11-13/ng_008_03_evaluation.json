That general principle supports the proposition that a defendant is vicariously liable for its employees\u2019 negligent acts (such as dropping a tray or dodging a puddle) committed in the course and scope of their employment. The factual context differs, but the legal doctrine cited is on point.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "To prevail against BMA, the plaintiffs need only establish that (1) at the time of the alleged negligence Dr. Schlitzer was an employee of BMA, and (2) the alleged negligent treatment of the plaintiff occurred within the scope of Dr. Schlitzer\u2019s employment by BMA. Once employment is established, the only remaining issue is whether he was working for BMA at the time of the alleged negligent treatment, i.e., whether his treatment of the plaintiff was within the scope of his employment by BMA. This comports with traditional agency law that \u2018[a]n employer is liable for torts committed by employees while acting in the scope of their employment.\u2019"

Our comparative negligence statute provides that the plaintiff's contributory negligence shall not bar recovery if the plaintiff's negligence was not greater than the total amount of negligence attributable to the parties against whom recovery is sought. The plaintiff's negligence, if less than the amount attributable to the defendant or defendants, only serves to diminish recovery by the proportion of negligence attributable to the plaintiff.
