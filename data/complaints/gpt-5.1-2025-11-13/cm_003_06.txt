v.  

MARK COLLINS,  
 Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, §28; G.L. c. 209C; G.L. c. 215, §6)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), self‑represented, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows with respect to the minor child, Ethan Collins:

### I. JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. This is a Complaint for Modification of a prior custody/parenting time judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §28, and the Court’s general equity jurisdiction under G.L. c. 215, §6, and applicable case law, including *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

2. Venue is proper in the Worcester Probate and Family Court because this Court issued the existing custody and parenting time orders concerning the minor child and because the child resides within this Court’s jurisdiction. See *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016).

3. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor child, Ethan Collins (date of birth omitted here but known to the parties and to the Court), granting the parties shared legal custody, with the child’s primary residence with the Plaintiff and parenting time for the Defendant on certain weekends (the “2021 Custody Order”).

4. At the time the 2021 Custody Order was entered, the Court found, based on the information then before it, that both parents were stable and that they could effectively co‑parent under a shared legal custody arrangement, and that the Defendant’s weekend parenting time was in the child’s best interests. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

5. The parties to this action are:

   a. Plaintiff/Mother:  
   Name: Jennifer Collins  
   Residence: (Address to be provided in Civil Action Cover Sheet / Confidential Information Form)  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com  

   b. Defendant/Father:  
   Name: Mark Collins  
   Residence: (Address known to the parties and to be provided to the Court in accordance with applicable rules)

6. The minor child whose custody and parenting time are at issue is:

   a. Ethan Collins, age 8.

7. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time for Ethan pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §28, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), G.L. c. 209B, because Massachusetts is and has been the child’s home state.

### II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD

8. Under Massachusetts law, modification of an existing custody or parenting time judgment requires a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order, and (2) that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, §28; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (2004).

9. The “paramount concern” of the Court in all custody and parenting time determinations is the best interests of the child. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); G.L. c. 208, §31.

10. The Court has broad equitable authority to impose conditions, restrictions, or supervision on parenting time where necessary to protect a child’s physical safety and emotional welfare, including orders related to substance use, supervision by a third party, or limitations on overnights, so long as such conditions are reasonably related to the child’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

11. A material change in circumstances exists where facts arising after the entry of the prior order demonstrate that the existing arrangement no longer serves the child’s best interests or poses an unreasonable risk to the child’s welfare. See *Diaz v. Diaz*, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 1122 (2021) (Rule 1:28 decision); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since the entry of the 2021 Custody Order, significant new facts have arisen concerning the Defendant’s behavior during his parenting time, particularly in relation to possible alcohol or other substance use while responsible for the minor child.

13. The 2021 Custody Order was premised on the understanding that both parents were stable and that neither posed a risk of impairment while caring for the child. At that time, there was no information suggesting that the Defendant consumed alcohol or other substances to the point of impairment during his parenting time.

14. Over the past several months, the minor child, Ethan, has made repeated statements to the Plaintiff describing “special drinks” at the Defendant’s residence, and has reported that the Defendant sometimes “can’t walk straight” during the Defendant’s parenting time.

15. The minor child is 8 years old and resides primarily with the Plaintiff. Ethan has no apparent motive to fabricate these observations, and his statements have been consistent over time.

16. A neighbor, who is aware of the family’s situation and the Defendant’s parenting time schedule, recently observed the Defendant returning home with Ethan late at night and recorded a video showing the Defendant stumbling while getting Ethan out of the car.

17. In that video, the Defendant appears unsteady on his feet, has difficulty walking in a straight line, and appears to be impaired in a manner consistent with intoxication or other substance influence, while Ethan is present and in his care.

18. The Plaintiff has been informed by school personnel that Ethan frequently appears extremely tired and exhausted on Monday mornings, following weekends at the Defendant’s residence, in noticeable contrast to other days of the week.

19. The Plaintiff has acted reasonably and in good faith, taking the child’s statements, the neighbor’s video, and the school’s observations seriously and becoming genuinely concerned that the Defendant may be using alcohol or other substances to the point of impairment during his parenting time.

20. The combination of (a) Ethan’s consistent reports of “special drinks” and the Defendant “not walking straight,” (b) the video evidence from the neighbor of the Defendant stumbling while responsible for Ethan late at night, and (c) the school’s observation of Ethan’s repeated exhaustion after weekends with the Defendant, were not contemplated by the Court in 2021 and represent a substantial and material change in circumstances.

21. These new circumstances raise legitimate and serious concerns about the child’s physical safety and emotional well‑being while in the Defendant’s unsupervised care and during overnight parenting time.

22. The Plaintiff is not seeking to eliminate the Defendant’s relationship with Ethan, but instead to modify the existing order to ensure that Ethan’s safety and welfare are protected while still preserving meaningful contact with his father, consistent with Massachusetts law emphasizing both the child’s best interests and the importance of ongoing contact with both parents when safe and appropriate. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 845–46; G.L. c. 208, §31.

23. The alleged impairment of the Defendant while caring for Ethan, particularly at night and during transportation, poses a risk of harm to Ethan, which constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2021 Custody Order. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–86 (upholding conditions on parenting where necessary to address substance abuse concerns); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998) (courts may consider parental unfitness and risk factors in relation to child’s best interests).

24. In light of these developments, the assumptions underlying the original shared legal custody and overnight weekend parenting time order are no longer accurate, and continuation of the current arrangement without modification would not adequately protect Ethan’s best interests.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

25. The Plaintiff acknowledges that it is generally in a child’s best interests to have frequent and continuing contact with both parents, provided such contact is safe and supportive of the child’s physical and emotional health. See *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986); G.L. c. 208, §31.

26. The Plaintiff believes that the Defendant loves Ethan and that Ethan loves the Defendant. The Plaintiff does not seek to sever that relationship but to ensure that contact occurs under conditions that do not expose Ethan to unnecessary risk.

27. The reported intoxication or impairment of the Defendant while exercising parenting time directly affects Ethan’s safety, including but not limited to:

   a. Safe transportation to and from the Defendant’s residence;  
   b. Adequate supervision of Ethan during the evening and nighttime;  
   c. Maintenance of appropriate household safety and routines (bedtime, meals, etc.); and  
   d. Ethan’s ability to sleep, rest, and attend school ready and alert on Mondays.

28. A child’s exposure to a caregiver who is intoxicated or otherwise impaired can cause emotional distress, anxiety, and instability, even in the absence of a specific accident or injury. The Court may consider the risk of harm and emotional impact as part of the best‑interests analysis. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 596–97; *Care & Protection of Lillith*, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 141 (2004).

29. The school’s reports of Ethan being exhausted on Mondays suggest that weekend conditions at the Defendant’s home may not be conducive to Ethan’s proper rest, routine, and school readiness, which are central to his best interests. See *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 870 (stability and routine important to child’s welfare).

30. Supervised parenting time, or overnights conditioned on sobriety safeguards, would allow Ethan to continue a relationship with the Defendant while significantly reducing the risk that Ethan will be in the Defendant’s sole care when the Defendant is impaired.

31. Massachusetts courts recognize that appropriate limitations or conditions on parenting time—such as supervision, testing, or other safeguards—are permissible and often necessary when there are credible concerns about substance use or similar issues, so long as the conditions are reasonably tailored to protect the child’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–86; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. at 548–49.

32. Given Ethan’s young age (8), his inability to protect himself in an emergency, and his dependence on the Defendant during parenting time, the risk created by the Defendant’s apparent impairment is particularly serious.

33. Therefore, modification of the existing custody/parenting time order to provide for supervised overnights, or in the alternative to impose conditions on the Defendant’s overnight parenting time (such as sobriety‑related conditions), is necessary and appropriate to safeguard Ethan’s best interests under G.L. c. 208, §§28, 31, and the case law cited above.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

34. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

35. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the 2021 Custody Order, based on the new information regarding the Defendant’s apparent substance use and impairment while caring for Ethan and the resulting impact on Ethan’s safety and well‑being.

36. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court find that modification of the existing custody/parenting time provisions is necessary to protect Ethan’s best interests, and that the following modifications be ordered:

   a. Legal Custody  

   i. That shared legal custody remain in effect only to the extent that the parties can safely communicate and cooperate concerning major decisions affecting Ethan’s health, education, and welfare; however, the Plaintiff requests that the Court consider granting the Plaintiff sole legal custody if the Court finds that the Defendant’s ongoing impairment meaningfully interferes with his ability to participate responsibly in such decisions. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

   b. Physical Custody and Parenting Time – General  

   i. That Ethan’s primary physical residence remain with the Plaintiff, as currently ordered.  

   ii. That the Defendant continue to have parenting time, but that such parenting time be modified as set forth below to ensure Ethan’s safety and welfare.

   c. Supervised / Conditioned Overnights  

   i. That all of the Defendant’s overnight parenting time be supervised by a neutral, responsible third party or supervised visitation center approved by the Court, until such time as the Defendant demonstrates to the Court that he is able to care for Ethan during overnights without impairment.  

   ii. In the alternative, if the Court declines to require full supervision of overnights at this time, that the Court impose conditions on the Defendant’s overnight parenting time, including but not limited to:  

    1. A prohibition on the consumption of alcohol, marijuana, or non‑prescribed controlled substances during, and for an appropriate number of hours immediately before, his parenting time;  

    2. Authorization for the Court to order random and/or scheduled alcohol or substance use testing (such as breath, urine, or other appropriate tests) as deemed necessary;  

    3. A requirement that the Defendant not drive with Ethan in the car if he has consumed alcohol or any substance that may impair his ability to drive safely, and that he arrange for sober transportation if needed;  

    4. Any other reasonable terms and safeguards the Court deems appropriate to protect Ethan’s best interests.

   d. Clarification of Schedules and Transitions  

   i. That the Court clarify the pick‑up and drop‑off times and locations in a manner that reduces late‑night transitions and promotes Ethan’s rest and school readiness.  

   ii. That the Court permit exchanges to occur in a public place or at a supervised center if the Court believes such arrangements would reduce conflict and support Ethan’s emotional well‑being.

   e. Additional Protective and Ancillary Orders  

   i. That the Court order the parties to comply with all existing statutes and rules regarding the protection of minor children and consider any other protective provisions it deems necessary under G.L. c. 208, §§28, 31, and G.L. c. 209C, §10.  

   ii. That the Court, in its discretion, order either or both parents to participate in parenting education, co‑parenting counseling, or other services designed to support Ethan’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 185–86.

37. The Plaintiff’s requested relief is narrowly tailored to address the specific, newly‑arisen concerns regarding the Defendant’s apparent impairment and to protect Ethan’s safety and emotional welfare, while allowing the father‑child relationship to continue under safer conditions.

38. The requested modification is consistent with Massachusetts statutes and case law requiring that custody and parenting time arrangements be adjusted when circumstances change in ways that materially affect the child’s welfare and best interests. See G.L. c. 208, §§28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, §10; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. at 370–71; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–97; *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. at 134–35.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the September 15, 2021 custody and parenting time order, specifically relating to the Defendant’s apparent substance use and impairment while caring for the minor child and the resulting risk to the child’s safety and welfare;

B. Determine and declare that modification of the prior custody/parenting time order is necessary to serve the best interests of Ethan Collins, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§28, 31, G.L. c. 209C, §10, and the applicable Massachusetts case law cited above;

C. Order that Ethan’s primary residence remain with the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins;

D. Modify the Defendant’s parenting time to require that all overnight parenting time be supervised by a responsible third party or supervised visitation center approved by the Court, or, in the alternative, impose appropriate conditions and safeguards on the Defendant’s overnight parenting time, including but not limited to restrictions on alcohol and substance use, testing, and safe transportation requirements, as the Court deems appropriate to protect Ethan’s best interests;

E. Consider whether shared legal custody remains appropriate in light of these circumstances, and, if warranted, grant the Plaintiff sole legal custody, or issue such orders regarding decision‑making as are in Ethan’s best interests;

F. Clarify the parenting time schedule, including pick‑up and drop‑off times and locations, to minimize late‑night transitions and to support Ethan’s rest and school performance;

G. Issue any additional protective orders or ancillary orders, including but not limited to orders for parenting education, co‑parenting counseling, or substance‑related conditions, that the Court views as reasonably necessary under its equitable powers to ensure Ethan’s safety and emotional well‑being;

H. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,
