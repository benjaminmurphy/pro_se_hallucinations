CIVIL ACTION NO. _________

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff, Jessica Langford (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Langford”), for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Silverman (“Defendant” or “Mr. Silverman”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Langford is an individual residing at 55 E Wareham Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (Suffolk County) (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Mark Silverman, upon information and belief, is an individual who owns and/or manages residential rental property including the Premises located at 55 E Wareham Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws c. 186 and c. 239.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment arising out of conditions and conduct at a residential rental unit in Boston, Massachusetts.

5. The Boston Division of the Housing Court Department has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 20, as this is a civil action involving a residential landlord‑tenant relationship and claims relating to the condition and use of a residential rental unit.

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Dorchester, a neighborhood of Boston, in Suffolk County. See G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3, 4.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about July 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises, a two‑bedroom apartment located at 55 E Wareham Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises as her home since on or about July 1, 2022.

9. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $2,200, payable to Defendant.

10. The tenancy is a residential tenancy governed by Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, G.L. c. 239, and the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

11. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord, has been responsible for providing and maintaining adequate heat in the Premises, in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See 105 C.M.R. 410.201 (landlord’s responsibility to provide heat).

12. The State Sanitary Code requires that from September 15 to June 15, every habitable room must be heated to not less than 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and not less than 64°F between 11:01 p.m. and 6:59 a.m. (now codified at 105 C.M.R. 410.201, formerly 410.200). See also G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L.

13. During the winter season of 2024–2025, and in particular during December 2024, January 2025, and February 2025, the heat in the Premises repeatedly failed to maintain a reasonably consistent and adequate temperature.

14. Specifically, Plaintiff’s heat would intermittently “cut out” for hours at a time, particularly in the evenings, causing the indoor temperature to drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

15. These heat failures were recurring and extended over many days and weeks, not an isolated incident.

16. Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant, directly and/or through Defendant’s agents, of these heating problems during the 2024–2025 heating season.

17. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on or about two occasions.

18. After the first service visit, Plaintiff was informed that the heating problem had been repaired. The heat functioned somewhat better for approximately one week but then the same problem of temperature dropping to around 60 degrees recurred.

19. After a second service visit, the repair person informed Plaintiff that the boiler serving the Premises was “old but functional” and that there was not much more that could be done.

20. Despite being aware that the heating system was “old” and that Plaintiff’s apartment was not maintaining adequate temperatures in the evenings, Defendant failed to make effective, lasting repairs or to replace or upgrade the boiler so that adequate heat would be consistently provided.

21. Following these incomplete or ineffective repairs, the intermittent loss of adequate heat continued, particularly in the evenings, throughout much of the winter.

22. Defendant was on notice, through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and the service visits, that the Premises were not being adequately heated and thus not meeting the minimum standards required by the State Sanitary Code.

23. Plaintiff repeatedly explained to Defendant that the temperature in her apartment was dropping to approximately 60 degrees for hours at a time, that this was occurring repeatedly during the heating season, and that she was suffering hardship as a result.

24. Defendant responded, in substance, that the heat was “working” because it never went completely out and the building was “not freezing,” and refused to take additional reasonable steps to provide adequate and consistent heat.

25. As a direct result of the inadequate heat and Defendant’s failure to correct the conditions, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and use two portable space heaters to keep the Premises at a livable temperature.

26. The operation of these space heaters substantially increased Plaintiff’s electric utility bills by approximately $150 per month for several winter months.

27. The additional utility charges directly resulted from Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat through the building’s heating system.

28. In January 2025, during the period of inadequate heat, Plaintiff developed bronchitis.

29. Plaintiff’s treating medical provider told her that the cold indoor air and fluctuating temperatures likely contributed to or exacerbated her bronchitis.

30. As a result of her illness, Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work and incurred out‑of‑pocket medical expenses, including but not limited to the cost of antibiotics.

31. The cold conditions in the Premises caused Plaintiff physical discomfort, interfered with her ability to sleep, and made it difficult for her to use and enjoy the Premises as her home.

32. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment were substantially impaired by the repeated failures of the heating system and Defendant’s failure to remedy the problem.

33. Plaintiff acted reasonably and took steps to mitigate her losses by purchasing space heaters to maintain a livable indoor environment.

34. Plaintiff has fully paid or become obligated to pay her rent during the relevant time period, yet did not receive the full benefit of her bargain due to the loss of heat and diminished habitability.

35. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to: increased utility costs of approximately $150 per month during the affected winter months; out‑of‑pocket medical and related expenses; lost wages from missed work days; and the loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

36. Based on the duration and severity of the heating issues, Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $1,200 in actual damages, exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, and costs.

### IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

37. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied warranty of habitability and a covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 186, § 14.

38. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from serious and substantial interference with her tenancy caused by the landlord or persons acting under the landlord’s control. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

39. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so “shall… be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

40. A landlord’s failure to correct defective conditions in a timely and reasonable manner, after notice, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, even where the landlord did not act with malice. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–90 (1994).

41. Violations of the State Sanitary Code, particularly those involving heat and basic utilities, may constitute or evidence a “serious interference” with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 790–91; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 192–93.

42. The Sanitary Code provisions governing heat are material to habitability and the tenant’s right to a safe and decent place to live. See 105 C.M.R. 410.201 (heat), 410.750; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L.

43. A landlord is strictly liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for violations of a tenant’s quiet enjoyment that result from the landlord’s acts or failures to act, including the landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to correct code violations or defective conditions. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 790–91; Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983–84 (1982).

44. Courts have found that persistent and uncorrected defects that substantially interfere with the tenant’s comfort, safety, or ability to use the premises—such as serious heating defects—constitute breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997) (landlord liable for failure to cure substantial defects after notice); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

45. Where a landlord violates G.L. c. 186, § 14, the statute mandates an award of “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 285; Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 403–04 (1982).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**  

46. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 45 as if fully set forth herein.

47. Plaintiff was, at all relevant times, a lawful residential tenant of Defendant at the Premises.

48. Defendant, as landlord, owed Plaintiff a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts common law.

49. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, including the duty to provide adequate heat during the heating season. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.201; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 191–93.

50. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the recurring heating failures and inadequate temperatures in Plaintiff’s apartment during the 2024–2025 winter season, based on Plaintiff’s multiple complaints and the service calls by Defendant’s agents.

51. Despite this knowledge, Defendant failed to take reasonable and effective steps to ensure that the Premises were adequately heated and that the heating system would reliably maintain temperatures that comply with the State Sanitary Code.

52. Defendant’s failure to correct the defective heating condition in a timely and effective manner, after notice, allowed a serious and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

53. The inadequate heat in the Premises, and the resulting indoor temperatures as low as approximately 60 degrees for extended periods, constituted a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

54. Defendant’s conduct, including his refusal to acknowledge the seriousness of the issue and his decision not to take additional remedial measures after being told that the boiler was “old but functional,” directly and foreseeably caused the continuing heating problems.

55. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for the acts and omissions of persons acting under his authority or control, including repair contractors who failed to correct the heating problem and who informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional.”

56. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as alleged above, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 790–91.

57. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Increased electric bills of approximately $150 per month during the affected winter months due to operation of space heaters to compensate for inadequate heat;

   b. Out‑of‑pocket medical expenses related to bronchitis and associated treatment (including antibiotics) that was likely exacerbated by the cold indoor conditions;

   c. Lost wages and/or income from approximately three days of missed work due to illness;

   d. Discomfort, physical distress, and diminished ability to safely and comfortably occupy the Premises;

   e. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises as a warm and habitable home during a substantial part of the winter.

58. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her actual damages at not less than $1,200, exclusive of statutory multipliers, interest, and costs.

59. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs of the action and reasonable attorney’s fees.

60. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $2,200; three months’ rent is therefore $6,600.

61. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is thus entitled to a statutory damage award of at least $6,600 (three months’ rent), because that amount is greater than her actual damages of approximately $1,200, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any are incurred).

62. Plaintiff also seeks any other relief available in law or equity for a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as the Court deems just and proper, including appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief if still relevant at the time of judgment.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Langford, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Mark Silverman, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has violated Plaintiff’s statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, by failing to provide and maintain adequate heat and by allowing conditions that substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises;

B. An award of damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than the greater of:

   1. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, reasonably estimated at not less than $1,200; or  

   2. Three months’ rent, i.e., $6,600 (3 × $2,200);

C. An award of costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable law;

D. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 to the extent Plaintiff incurs such fees in connection with this action;

E. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law;

F. Such further legal or equitable relief as the Court deems just and proper.

### VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
