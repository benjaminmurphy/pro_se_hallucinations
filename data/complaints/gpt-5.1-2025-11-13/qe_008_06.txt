    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains of Defendant John Smith (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez is an individual residing at 45 Washington Avenue, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant John Smith is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and/or lessor of the residential rental property located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and has exercised control over the common areas, entry doors, and security conditions of the building at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is approximately Three Hundred Twenty Dollars ($320), exclusive of costs, interest, and any statutory multiple damages and attorneys’ fees that may be available under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

6. The Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

7. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21, jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Chelsea Division of the District Court Department because the rental property is located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction and the claims arose there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, MA 02150 (the “Apartment” or “Unit”), owned and/or managed by Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment since on or about January 15, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,450) to Defendant.

10. Defendant retains control over the building’s main entry door and common areas, including the front hallway, mail area, and basement.

11. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a statutory and common-law duty to maintain the building and common areas in a reasonably safe and secure condition and to ensure that Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises was not interfered with, as required by G.L. c. 186, § 14, and applicable case law, including but not limited to *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); and *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

12. For at least the last two (2) months prior to the filing of this Complaint, and on dates including but not limited to approximately October 1, 2025, November 1, 2025, and thereafter, the main exterior entry door to the building at 45 Washington Avenue has had a broken or defective lock.

13. Specifically, the main entry door does not properly latch, and anyone can push the door open without a key, card, or buzzer; the door therefore fails to provide basic security to the tenants of the building, including Plaintiff.

14. The condition of the main entry door and lock constitutes a defective and unsafe condition within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and violates the implied warranty of habitability and minimum standards of fitness, habitability, and safety under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.000 et seq.), and related case law, including *Hemingway v. Fernandez*, 363 Mass. 46 (1973), and *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

15. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the broken and unsafe condition of the main entry door lock approximately two (2) months before the filing of this Complaint, around early October 2025.

16. Plaintiff informed Defendant that the door did not latch and that anyone could walk into the building, and requested that Defendant promptly repair or replace the lock.

17. Defendant acknowledged the problem and told Plaintiff that he would fix it, but failed to do so within a reasonable time.

18. After Defendant failed to act, Plaintiff reminded Defendant on at least two subsequent occasions—approximately later in October 2025 and again in November 2025—that the main entry door remained broken and unsecured.

19. Defendant again failed and refused to repair the lock or to take any reasonable steps to secure the building, despite repeated notice and the ease with which the problem could be remedied.

20. Defendant’s failure to maintain proper security at the main entry door created and continued an unreasonable risk of unauthorized entry, theft, and intrusion, foreseeably endangering Plaintiff’s person, privacy, property, and peaceful use of the Premises.

21. In or about November 2025, an unauthorized person or persons entered the building through the unsecured main entry door, went through the mail area and hallway, and stole packages that had been delivered to tenants, including Plaintiff.

22. Plaintiff had a package delivered that month, with a value of approximately One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120), which was taken from the hallway after unauthorized individuals entered the building.

23. Plaintiff also discovered evidence that one or more unauthorized persons had been sleeping in the basement of the building, including items and signs of overnight occupancy.

24. The presence of unauthorized persons sleeping in the basement, in combination with the defective main entry door lock, has made Plaintiff feel unsafe, disturbed, and anxious in her own home, and has interfered with her ability to enjoy and peacefully occupy the Apartment.

25. Plaintiff reasonably fears for her personal safety and the security of her belongings as a result of the unsecured building entrance and the unauthorized entries and use of the building.

26. Plaintiff has been forced to incur out-of-pocket expenses to try to compensate for Defendant’s failure to provide basic security to the building.

27. Specifically, Plaintiff purchased a security camera for her apartment door and a better deadbolt for the Apartment, at a cost of approximately Two Hundred Dollars ($200), in an effort to protect herself and her property from theft and intrusion arising from the defective building entry door and Defendant’s failure to act.

28. Defendant has refused or failed to reimburse Plaintiff for the loss of her stolen property and for the cost of the additional security measures she was forced to purchase.

29. When Plaintiff raised these serious safety and security concerns, Defendant dismissed her concerns, told her she was “overreacting,” and stated that the neighborhood was safe, even though there had already been thefts and evidence of unauthorized persons in the building.

30. Defendant’s failure to repair the entry door lock, despite repeated notice and the occurrence of theft and unauthorized entry, constitutes an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

31. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of a residential tenant’s premises. Liability can arise from acts or omissions that, in the natural and probable consequences, substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment, even without malicious intent. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

32. By knowingly allowing the main entry door to remain broken and unsecured, and by ignoring Plaintiff’s repeated requests for repair after thefts and intrusions had occurred, Defendant has engaged in conduct that directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

33. The unsafe and unsecured condition of the main entry door also constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code’s requirement that the owner maintain the building and its means of egress in good repair and in a safe condition, and provide reasonable security, including functioning locks on building entry doors, see 105 CMR 410.351, 410.480, and cases such as *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979), and *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).

34. Plaintiff’s reasonable expectation of a secure and habitable residence with functional locks and basic building security is an essential element of quiet enjoyment protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14, and by common law. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Loss of personal property and mail, including a stolen package valued at approximately $120;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $200 for a security camera and an upgraded deadbolt for her apartment door;  
   c. Substantial emotional distress, fear, and anxiety associated with living in a building that is not properly secured;  
   d. Interference with the comfort, safety, and peaceful use of her home; and  
   e. Diminished value of the tenancy and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.

36. The total out-of-pocket monetary loss to Plaintiff attributable to Defendant’s failure to maintain security and breach of quiet enjoyment is approximately Three Hundred Twenty Dollars ($320), exclusive of any statutory multiple damages, interest, and costs.

37. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant is liable for either (a) actual and consequential damages or (b) three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

38. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is approximately One Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,450). Three times the monthly rent is Four Thousand Three Hundred Fifty Dollars ($4,350), which exceeds Plaintiff’s actual out-of-pocket damages.

39. Plaintiff therefore seeks, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, statutory damages equal to three times the monthly rent—$4,350—or such other amount as the Court deems proper under the statute and the evidence, as well as her actual damages and allowable costs.

40. Plaintiff also seeks any additional relief the Court finds just and appropriate to remedy Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, including declaratory relief and orders requiring Defendant to correct the unsafe conditions, consistent with the purposes of G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, and related regulations and case law, including *Hemingway*, *Berman*, and *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

41. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any lessor or landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant shall be liable for actual and consequential damages, or three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, together with the costs of the action and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

43. A covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease in Massachusetts. See *Hemingway v. Fernandez*, 363 Mass. 46 (1973); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

44. A landlord’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment may arise from acts or omissions that, in their natural and probable consequences, cause a serious and substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, regardless of malice. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

45. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a duty not to interfere, directly or indirectly, with her quiet enjoyment of the Premises and to maintain the building and its common areas, including the main entry door and lock, in a reasonably safe and secure condition.

46. Defendant had actual notice, on multiple occasions over at least two months, that the main entry door lock to the building was broken, did not latch properly, and allowed anyone to push the door open without a key or permission.

47. Defendant knew or should have known that leaving the main entry door unsecured created an unreasonable risk of unauthorized access, theft, and intrusion, and was reasonably likely to interfere with tenants’ safe and peaceful occupancy of the Premises.

48. Despite such notice, Defendant failed and refused to repair the lock or otherwise secure the main entry door within a reasonable time, and failed to take other reasonable measures to protect the security of the building.

49. Defendant’s inaction occurred after Plaintiff specifically reported the condition and after there were known incidents of mail tampering, package theft, and evidence of unauthorized persons sleeping in the building’s basement.

50. Defendant’s failure to act under these circumstances constitutes an intentional and/or reckless and/or negligent disregard of Plaintiff’s right to safe, peaceful, and secure occupancy, and is a direct and indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and controlling precedent, including *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987); and *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

51. Defendant’s conduct also implicates violations of the State Sanitary Code and statutory obligations to maintain habitable and safe housing, further supporting a finding of substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.; *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 46; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 196.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Loss of property (stolen package valued at approximately $120);  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses (approximately $200) for a security camera and upgraded deadbolt;  
   c. Emotional distress, fear, and anxiety regarding her personal safety and the security of her home;  
   d. Disturbance and disruption of her peaceful use and enjoyment of the Premises; and  
   e. Diminution in the value and habitability of the tenancy.

53. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either (a) her actual and consequential damages or (b) three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, together with the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

54. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,450, and three times the monthly rent is $4,350, which is greater than Plaintiff’s actual out-of-pocket losses.

55. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages equal to three times the monthly rent, plus costs, and any other relief the Court deems just and proper, as authorized by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and cases such as *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); and *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).
