COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BARNSTABLE DIVISION  

---------------------------------------------------------------  
EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                   
                                                     Docket No. __________

MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
---------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Johnson.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), is an individual who, upon information and belief, presently resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on or near Cape Cod.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - Sophie Johnson, age 8.

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the prior custody judgment issued by this Court on May 15, 2019.

5. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the existing judgment was issued in this Division and the child has significant connections to this jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 209B.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about May 15, 2019, this Court entered a judgment and/or agreement incorporated into a judgment (the “2019 Judgment”) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child.

7. Under the 2019 Judgment, Mother has primary physical custody of Sophie, and Father has parenting time consisting of (a) every other weekend, and (b) one midweek overnight on Wednesdays, with the child returning to school Thursday morning.

8. At the time the 2019 Judgment was entered, both parties resided in the same town, and the midweek overnight required only a brief, approximately five‑minute drive to Sophie’s school on Thursday mornings.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the minor child, warranting modification of the parenting-time provisions under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and related Massachusetts law.

10. Specifically, after entry of the 2019 Judgment, Father moved his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles away from Sophie’s school and Mother’s home.

11. Despite this relocation, Father continues to insist upon exercising the Wednesday midweek overnight, which now requires:

   a. Father picking Sophie up from school on Wednesday;  
   b. Driving approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence on Cape Cod; and  
   c. Waking Sophie at or about 4:30 a.m. on Thursday to drive back approximately ninety (90) miles for school.

12. As a result of this schedule, Sophie experiences significantly reduced and disrupted sleep on Wednesday nights and must endure lengthy, early‑morning commutes on school days.

13. Mother is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Sophie is often exhausted on Thursdays due to these early‑morning drives and insufficient sleep.

14. Sophie’s teacher has reported to Mother that Sophie’s participation and engagement in class have noticeably declined on Thursdays, as compared with other school days, and that Sophie appears tired and less able to focus on those days.

15. The current midweek overnight arrangement was originally agreed to and/or ordered on the assumption that the parents lived in close proximity to one another and to Sophie’s school, such that Wednesday overnights would not interfere with the child’s rest, education, or travel time.

16. Father’s relocation to Cape Cod, combined with his continued insistence on the same midweek overnight schedule, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances not contemplated at the time of the 2019 Judgment.

17. The burdensome travel and resulting fatigue adversely affect Sophie’s wellbeing, school performance, and daily routine and are inconsistent with her best interests.

18. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting‑time order may be modified where there has been a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child and where modification is in the child’s best interest. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19. The material change in circumstances here is the Father’s significant geographic relocation and the resulting, unreasonably long commute imposed on a school‑aged child on a school night, which negatively impacts her rest, education, and stability.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

20. In any matter involving custody or parenting time, the paramount consideration is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

21. The best‑interest determination is fact‑specific and considers the child’s emotional, physical, and developmental needs, stability, continuity, and the capacity of the parents to meet those needs. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–844; Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243–244 (2000).

22. Stability and continuity in a child’s schooling, sleep, and daily routine are central components of the best‑interest analysis. See Custody of a Minor, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 402, 407–08 (1988); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 224–25 (1998).

23. Courts in Massachusetts recognize that a substantial change in a parent’s residence and the resulting travel burdens may justify modifying parenting time to protect a child’s best interests. See Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 151–52 (2015) (relocation and logistics can warrant modification); Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710–11 (1985) (relocation analysis balances child’s needs, including stability and routine).

24. The current midweek overnight requires Sophie, an 8‑year‑old elementary school student, to:

   a. Lose significant sleep every Wednesday night;  
   b. Wake at approximately 4:30 a.m.; and  
   c. Endure a long, ninety‑mile car ride immediately before school.

25. This routine is developmentally inappropriate for a child of Sophie’s age and is inconsistent with medical and educational understanding of the importance of regular sleep and predictable school‑day routines.

26. The teacher’s report that Sophie’s participation and engagement have dropped on Thursdays is consistent with the predictable effects of sleep deprivation and excessive early‑morning travel on a school‑age child.

27. The continuation of the existing Wednesday overnight schedule thus undermines Sophie’s educational progress, physical health, emotional wellbeing, and overall stability.

28. While it is important to maintain a meaningful relationship between Father and Sophie, that relationship should be fostered in a manner that does not impose excessive travel or interfere with the child’s education and health. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845–46; Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (parenting arrangements must support rather than undermine child’s welfare).

29. The requested modification eliminates only the midweek overnight and modestly adjusts weekend parenting time; it is narrowly tailored to address the specific harm caused by the long school‑night commute while preserving Father’s relationship with Sophie.

30. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and Massachusetts case law, when a material change in circumstances arises, the Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the minor children” if required in the child’s best interests. See also Boucher v. Boucher, 403 Mass. 1002 (1988) (rescript); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 543–44 (2010).

31. Given Father’s relocation and the resulting impact on Sophie, modification is necessary and appropriate to protect her best interests.

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

32. G.L. c. 208, § 28, authorizes this Court to modify custody and parenting‑time provisions upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a showing that modification is in the best interests of the child.

33. G.L. c. 208, § 31, provides that in awarding or modifying custody, the rights of the parents shall be held equal, and the happiness and welfare of the child shall determine custody and parenting time.

34. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that a material change in circumstances is a prerequisite to modification and that the court must then consider whether the proposed change serves the child’s best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–843; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 543–544; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262.

35. The change in circumstances here—Father’s move from the same town to a residence approximately ninety miles away, and the resulting extreme early‑morning commute on school days—was not contemplated at the time of the 2019 Judgment and constitutes a substantial departure from the assumptions underlying that order.

36. The Appeals Court has recognized that changes affecting the practical operation of an existing parenting plan, including distance and transportation burdens, may constitute the kind of material change justifying modification. See Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 151–52; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 261–62.

37. Where, as here, the existing parenting schedule is shown to cause educational, emotional, or physical harm, modification is warranted to align the schedule with the child’s best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596; Custody of a Minor, 26 Mass. App. Ct. at 407–08; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 224–25.

38. The requested relief respects the importance of the child’s relationship with both parents while prioritizing Sophie’s need for adequate rest, predictable school‑day routines, and educational stability.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

39. Mother does not seek to change legal custody or primary physical custody but seeks a limited modification of parenting time to address the material change in circumstances described above.

40. Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight with Father during the school year;  

   b. Provide that, in lieu of the midweek overnight, Father shall have reasonable after‑school parenting time on an agreed weekday, without overnight and without requiring long‑distance travel on a school night (for example, a midweek dinner visit in or near the child’s school community, with return at a reasonable hour on the same evening);  

   c. Confirm or clarify that Father shall continue to exercise parenting time on alternate weekends, from after school (or a specified time) on Friday until Sunday at a reasonable hour (for example, 6:00 p.m.), with exchanges at a mutually convenient location that minimizes disruption to Sophie; and  

   d. Authorize such modest adjustments to the weekend schedule as the Court deems necessary to ensure that Sophie is not subjected to excessive late‑night or early‑morning travel associated with school days.

41. Mother also requests that the Court enter such additional and further orders as may be necessary to implement the modified schedule in a manner that protects Sophie’s schooling, sleep, and overall wellbeing, including but not limited to provisions clarifying holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time consistent with the elimination of school‑night overnights involving long‑distance travel.

42. The relief requested is the least restrictive modification necessary to remedy the educational and health‑related harms arising from the current midweek overnight arrangement.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2019 custody and parenting‑time judgment, specifically including the Father’s relocation to Cape Cod and the resulting early‑morning, long‑distance travel imposed on the minor child on school days.

2. Find and rule that continuation of the existing Wednesday midweek overnight is not in the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Johnson, given its detrimental impact on her sleep, school performance, and overall wellbeing.

3. Modify the 2019 Judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, as follows:

   a. Eliminate Father’s current Wednesday midweek overnight with Sophie during the school year;  

   b. Replace the midweek overnight with reasonable midweek, non‑overnight parenting time for Father (for example, after‑school or evening contact in or near Sophie’s school community), to begin and end at times that do not interfere with Sophie’s regular bedtime or school attendance the following day;  

   c. Confirm and/or adjust Father’s alternate‑weekend parenting time so that it remains substantial but minimizes excessively late‑night or early‑morning long‑distance travel connected with school days; and  

   d. Enter any related clarifying orders regarding holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time as may be necessary to provide a clear, stable schedule for Sophie.

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in order to serve the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,  
EMILY JOHNSON
