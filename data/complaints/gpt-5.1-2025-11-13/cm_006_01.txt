COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time – Safety of Minor Children)  
--------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Mark Richards (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the Mother of the minor children, Emily Richards (date of birth: ________) and Jacob Richards (date of birth: ________) (“the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Mark Richards, upon information and belief, resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the Father of the Children.

3. The Children, Emily (age 8) and Jacob (age 6), are minor children subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A and 37, and G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6, as this is a domestic relations matter involving custody and parenting time of minor children previously adjudicated by this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Worcester Probate and Family Court because the prior Judgment involving custody and parenting time was entered in this Division, and the parties and the Children reside within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about May 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (the “Judgment”) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the Children.

7. Under the Judgment, Mother was awarded primary physical custody of the Children.

8. Under the Judgment, Father was granted parenting time on alternating weekends and one midweek visit each week.

9. At the time of the Judgment, neither party was in a serious relationship, and the Judgment did not contain any provisions addressing exposure of the Children to new romantic partners or household members, nor did it address conditions regarding the criminal or domestic violence history of adults in the Children’s presence.

### IV. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

10. A Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody or parenting time judgment upon a showing of (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (b) that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

11. The paramount concern of the Court in custody and parenting time determinations is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

12. The Court has broad equitable authority to modify custody and parenting time arrangements to protect the safety and welfare of minor children when circumstances have changed. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

13. In determining best interests, the Court may and should consider evidence of domestic violence, abuse, or a pattern of coercive, controlling, or intimidating behavior in the child’s environment, including the conduct of a parent’s current or former partner. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 209A; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

14. The Court may impose conditions on parenting time, including supervised visitation and restrictions on the presence of certain third parties, when necessary to protect a child’s physical and emotional well‑being. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); M.C. v. T.K., 463 Mass. 226 (2012); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

15. Massachusetts appellate decisions recognize that exposure of children to domestic conflict, violence, or threatening or volatile behavior within a household may justify a modification of custody or parenting time, even where the children are not the direct targets of physical abuse, when such exposure compromises their safety or emotional development. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–597; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845–848; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–227; Care & Protection of Lillian, 445 Mass. 333 (2005); Care & Protection of Frank, 409 Mass. 492 (1991).

### V. MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

16. Since entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children’s safety and welfare.

17. After the Judgment, Father entered into a serious relationship with, and now resides with, an adult individual (hereinafter, “the Partner”) who has a criminal record for assault and battery.

18. Upon information and belief, the Partner has previously been the subject of a restraining order (protective order) obtained by a former girlfriend pursuant to G.L. c. 209A, relating to allegations of abuse.

19. The Partner regularly resides in the same home as Father and is present during Father’s parenting time with Emily and Jacob.

20. The Judgment did not anticipate or address the presence of an unrelated adult with a history of violence and a prior restraining order, regularly being in the home with the Children during Father’s parenting time.

21. The Partner’s presence and behavior in Father’s home, as described below, constitute significant new facts and a substantial change in circumstances, directly affecting the Children’s physical safety and emotional well‑being.

### VI. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SAFETY CONCERNS

22. The Children have reported to Mother that the Partner frequently yells in the home during Father’s parenting time.

23. The Children have reported that the Partner slams doors, acts in an angry and volatile manner, and creates a loud, frightening environment.

24. The Children have expressed fear and anxiety to Mother regarding the Partner’s outbursts and behavior in Father’s home.

25. On at least one occasion, according to the Children, the Partner grabbed one of the Children’s arms with sufficient force to leave a visible mark on the Child’s arm.

26. Mother observed the mark on the Child’s arm shortly after the Child returned from Father’s parenting time.

27. The Child reported to Mother that the mark was caused by the Partner’s grabbing or handling of the Child.

28. On another occasion, a neighbor called the police to Father’s residence during a loud argument when the Children were present in the home.

29. Upon information and belief, this incident involved a loud, heated altercation in which the Partner’s yelling and conduct were sufficiently concerning to the neighbor that the neighbor contacted law enforcement to respond.

30. The Children reported hearing loud fighting and yelling during this episode, which caused them distress and fear.

31. Mother is informed and believes that the Partner’s past criminal conviction(s) for assault and battery, combined with the prior issuance of a restraining order against the Partner, indicate a pattern or history of violent or abusive behavior.

32. Mother has never consented to the Children’s unsupervised exposure to an adult with such a history of violence and a prior restraining order, particularly within the confines of the home where the Children are meant to feel safe.

33. The Partner is not a parent or legal guardian of the Children, and there is no legal, biological, or adoptive relationship between the Partner and the Children.

34. The Children are young (ages 8 and 6), vulnerable, and dependent upon the adults in their environment for safety, stability, and emotional security.

35. The Partner’s conduct, criminal history, and prior restraining order, combined with the Children’s reports of yelling, door slamming, rough physical handling, and a police‑response incident, create a substantial and ongoing risk to the Children’s physical and emotional well‑being.

36. The existing parenting plan does not contain any safeguards or conditions addressing the Partner’s contact with the Children, nor does it provide for supervised parenting time or monitoring of the home environment.

37. Mother reasonably fears for the Children’s safety and emotional health when they are in Father’s home while the Partner is present.

38. Mother’s concerns are grounded in the Partner’s known criminal and restraining‑order history, the Children’s direct statements, Mother’s own observations of physical marks on a Child, and the fact that a neighbor deemed the situation serious enough to call the police.

39. The cumulative effect of these circumstances is to create an unsafe and unstable environment for the Children during Father’s parenting time.

40. The presence of an adult with a history of assault and a prior restraining order, actively engaging in volatile and physically inappropriate conduct around the Children, is a substantial and material change in circumstances that did not exist at the time of the May 15, 2021 Judgment.

### VII. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

41. The Court must prioritize the best interests of Emily and Jacob, including their safety, security, and healthy emotional development, over any competing interests in maintaining an unchanged parenting schedule. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590.

42. Exposure of children to domestic conflict, intimidation, or violent or threatening behavior can cause significant emotional harm, even where the children themselves are not the direct targets of physical assault. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–597; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–227; Care & Protection of Lillian, 445 Mass. 333 (2005).

43. The Partner’s past assault and battery conviction, history of being the subject of a G.L. c. 209A restraining order, and ongoing volatile behavior in the Children’s presence, present serious safety concerns that warrant protective conditions on Father’s parenting time. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 209A; Custody of Vaughn, supra.

44. It is in the Children’s best interests that their time with Father occur in a safe, calm, and stable environment, free from exposure to violence, abuse, or threatening conduct by any adult in the household.

45. The requested modification does not seek to terminate Father’s relationship with the Children, but rather to structure and condition parenting time so that the Children are protected from foreseeable harm.

46. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court has broad authority to modify custody and parenting time where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is in the Children’s best interests.

47. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31A and the principles underlying G.L. c. 209A, the Court may impose conditions necessary to protect the Children from exposure to abuse or domestic violence, including limiting or barring contact with specific third parties and ordering supervised parenting time when appropriate.

48. Given the Children’s young ages, the Partner’s history, and the documented concerns, less restrictive means (such as Mother’s mere admonitions to Father) are insufficient to ensure the Children’s safety.

49. The requested relief—requiring that the Partner not be present during Father’s parenting time, or alternatively ordering that Father’s parenting time occur under professional supervision—is narrowly tailored to address the specific safety risks and is consistent with Massachusetts case law allowing conditions on visitation to protect children. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–227; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); M.C. v. T.K., 463 Mass. 226 (2012).

50. The Children’s continued unsupervised exposure to the Partner in the home presents an ongoing risk of physical and emotional harm that is contrary to their best interests.

### VIII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

51. Mother seeks a modification of the May 15, 2021 Judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related statutes, based on the material and substantial changes in circumstances described herein and in order to protect the best interests of the Children.

52. Specifically, Mother requests that this Court enter an order modifying Father’s parenting time as follows:

   a. That the Partner with a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order not be present in the home, vehicle, or vicinity during any parenting time or contact between Father and the Children;  

   OR, in the alternative,

   b. That all of Father’s parenting time with the Children be supervised by a neutral, professional supervisor or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, with Father responsible for any associated costs, until further order of the Court;  

   AND, in addition,

   c. That Father be ordered not to permit any person with a history of violent criminal convictions or prior restraining orders for abuse or domestic violence to have unsupervised contact with the Children;  

   d. That Father promptly notify Mother, in writing, of any future significant romantic partner with whom he resides or who regularly stays overnight while the Children are present, and provide, upon request, sufficient identifying information to allow Mother or her counsel to inquire into any relevant criminal or restraining order history;  

   e. That both parties be ordered to refrain from exposing the Children to physical discipline, yelling, intimidation, or other conduct reasonably likely to cause the Children fear or emotional distress, whether by themselves or by any other adult in their households;  

   f. That the existing alternating weekend and midweek parenting schedule remain in effect only to the extent consistent with the above safety conditions, and that any necessary adjustments to times, exchanges, or locations be made by the Court to facilitate supervised visits or third‑party‑free parenting time;  

   g. That the Court issue any additional orders it deems necessary and appropriate to safeguard the Children’s physical safety and emotional well‑being, including, if warranted, an order appointing a guardian ad litem (GAL) or other neutral professional to investigate and make recommendations concerning the Children’s safety in Father’s home environment.

### IX. GROUNDS FOR RELIEF

53. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the May 15, 2021 Judgment, specifically: Father’s cohabitation with the Partner who has a history of assault and battery and a prior restraining order; the Partner’s frequent yelling and volatile behavior in the Children’s presence; the Partner’s physical grabbing of one Child, leaving a mark; and a police‑response incident during a loud argument while the Children were present.

54. These changes directly affect the Children’s safety, emotional welfare, and best interests, and were not contemplated by the Court at the time of the original Judgment.

55. In light of these new circumstances, modification of the existing custody and parenting time order is necessary and appropriate under G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, §§ 31 and 31A; and the relevant case law, including but not limited to:

   - Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010);  
   - Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998);  
   - Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755 (1983);  
   - Care & Protection of Lillian, 445 Mass. 333 (2005);  
   - Care & Protection of Frank, 409 Mass. 492 (1991);  
   - Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   - M.C. v. T.K., 463 Mass. 226 (2012); and  
   - Related statutory provisions: G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; G.L. c. 209A; G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6.

### X. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

B. Modify the existing custody and parenting time provisions of the May 15, 2021 Judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related statutes;

C.

D. Order that Father shall not permit any adult with a violent criminal history or prior restraining orders for abuse or domestic violence to have unsupervised contact with the Children;

G. If the Court deems it helpful, appoint a guardian ad litem or other neutral professional to investigate the Children’s safety and emotional well‑being in Father’s home environment and to make recommendations to the Court;

H. Award such further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor Children.
