PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

DOCKET NO. ___________  
  
JESSICA THOMPSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL DAVIS,  
  Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME / LEGAL DECISION-MAKING)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

1. This is a Complaint for Modification of a prior Judgment of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court concerning legal custody and parenting time for the minor child:

   - Emily Davis, date of birth: __________ (age 9).

2. The parties are the natural parents of the minor child:

   a. Plaintiff/Mother: Jessica Thompson, currently residing in __________, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
   b. Defendant/Father: Michael Davis, currently residing in __________, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A and 31, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, because the prior Judgment regarding custody and parenting time was issued by this Court and the child presently resides in the Commonwealth.

4. On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (or Judgment of Divorce/Separate Support/Parenting Judgment, as applicable) establishing custody and parenting time for the minor child (“the 2021 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2021 Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody of the minor child, with Mother as the primary residential parent. The 2021 Judgment grants Father substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnights, and requires both parents to cooperate on school matters and to keep each other informed regarding the child’s education.

6. At the time the 2021 Judgment was entered, the minor child was doing well academically. She was regularly attending school, her grades and test scores were satisfactory, and there were no significant concerns regarding truancy or chronic absence.

7. Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child’s welfare and best interests, particularly with respect to school attendance, academic performance, and Father’s exercise of parenting time and joint legal custody responsibilities.

8. Over the past year, Father has repeatedly and intentionally kept the minor child home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnights, stating that the child “needs a mental health day” or similar reasons without any medical documentation.

9. These Monday absences have occurred on numerous occasions, have been unexcused by the school, and have not been supported by any physician’s or mental health provider’s note, recommendation, or treatment plan.

10. As a direct result of these repeated Monday absences during Father’s custodial time, the child’s school has issued truancy and excessive absence warnings to the parents, and has expressed concern regarding the child’s pattern of absenteeism.

11. Over the same period, the child’s academic performance has declined, including decreases in grades and standardized test scores, which the school has linked in part to inconsistent attendance and missed instructional time.

12. The child has been recommended, either by the school or by Mother in consultation with the school, to attend tutoring sessions to address academic concerns. Some of these tutoring sessions are scheduled during Father’s weekend parenting time.

13. Father has regularly refused or failed to bring the child to these tutoring sessions when they fall during his parenting time, despite knowing the sessions were scheduled and intended to help address the child’s academic difficulties.

14. Father has also failed to cooperate in a meaningful way with Mother and the school regarding educational decisions, attendance plans, and academic supports, contrary to the 2021 Judgment’s requirement that the parties cooperate on school matters and keep each other informed.

15. Father’s pattern of (a) keeping the child out of school on Mondays after his weekends, (b) refusing or failing to bring the child to scheduled tutoring, and (c) failing to cooperate with Mother and the school on education-related issues has created a serious and ongoing risk to the child’s educational progress, school attendance record, and overall best interests.

16. Due to this conduct since entry of the 2021 Judgment, the parties’ joint legal custody arrangement as it pertains to educational decision-making, and the current Sunday overnight parenting schedule, are no longer workable or in the best interests of the minor child.

17. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Probate and Family Court may modify prior judgments concerning custody and visitation upon a showing of a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child and where modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g.:

   - **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

18. Massachusetts law further provides that the best interests of the child are the “overriding and paramount concern” in custody and parenting matters. See:

   - **G.L. c. 208, § 31** (defining legal and physical custody and requiring the court to consider the child’s best interests);  
   - **Custody of a Minor**, 389 Mass. 755, 766–67 (1983);  
   - **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998);  
   - **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

19. The child’s consistent school attendance and academic progress form a critical component of her best interests, and the Court may, and should, take into account each parent’s demonstrated willingness and ability to meet the child’s educational needs. See:

   - **Cabot v. Cabot**, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 765–67 (2002) (court may consider which parent is more likely to foster and support the child’s needs and development);  
   - **Stone v. Stone**, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–40 (1997) (emphasizing importance of stability and parental support for the child’s welfare).

20. Where, as here, the parties’ joint legal custody arrangement has broken down in practice with respect to a significant area (education) and one parent has persistently failed to act in the child’s educational best interests, the Court may modify the prior judgment to allocate decision-making authority to the parent better able and more willing to meet the child’s needs. See, e.g.:

   - **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540, 547–49 (2010) (recognizing that modification is appropriate when material changes render the original order not in the child’s best interests);  
   - **Conley v. Conley**, 413 Mass. 722, 727–28 (1992) (modification based on substantial change impacting the child);  
   - **Dalessio v. Dalessio**, 409 Mass. 821, 824–25 (1991) (same).

21. The pattern of unexcused school absences occurring exclusively during Father’s custodial time, the truancy warnings issued by the school, the documented decline in the child’s grades and test scores, and Father’s refusal or failure to bring the child to tutoring sessions together constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2021 Judgment.

22. These changes directly and negatively affect the child’s welfare and demonstrate that the existing parenting-time schedule, specifically Father’s Sunday overnight parenting time and de facto control over Monday school attendance, is no longer consistent with the child’s best interests.

23. They also demonstrate that the parties’ joint legal custody arrangement, as applied to educational decision-making, is unworkable and contrary to the child’s best interests because Father repeatedly exercises his authority in a way that undermines the child’s education and school attendance.

24. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, and the cases cited above, the Court may and should consider the child’s educational needs, each parent’s cooperation with the school, and each parent’s ability and willingness to ensure regular attendance and participation in academic supports, in determining custody and parenting time.

25. In addition, under G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify parenting time and decision-making authority upon finding a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See also:

   - **Rosenberg v. Merida**, 428 Mass. 182, 190–91 (1998) (modification appropriate when circumstances change such that the prior order no longer serves the child’s best interests);  
   - **Pappas v. Pappas**, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 600–01 (1991) (same).

26. It is in the child’s best interests that Mother be granted final decision-making authority regarding the child’s education, including but not limited to school attendance, participation in tutoring and other academic support services, and related school-based interventions.

27. It is further in the child’s best interests that Father’s parenting time be modified so that he does not have Sunday overnights during the school year, or, in the alternative, that any Sunday overnight parenting time be expressly conditioned on Father’s ensuring that the child attends school on Monday absent a bona fide medical reason supported by appropriate documentation.

28. These proposed modifications are narrowly tailored to address the specific material change in circumstances—namely, Father’s pattern of keeping the child out of school on Mondays and failing to support her academic needs—while preserving Father’s relationship with the child to the extent consistent with her educational welfare.

29. The requested modifications will promote the child’s regular school attendance, improve her academic stability, and align with the statutory and common-law requirement that the child’s best interests be paramount in all custody and parenting determinations.

30. Mother is not seeking to eliminate Father’s relationship with the child, but rather to adjust legal custody and parenting time in a manner that protects the child’s educational needs and responds to the material change in circumstances since the 2021 Judgment.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that since entry of the Judgment dated June 15, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to a pattern of unexcused Monday absences from school during Father’s custodial time, truancy warnings from the school, declining academic performance, and Father’s failure to bring the child to tutoring and to cooperate on school-related matters.

B. Modify the prior Judgment to grant Mother final decision-making authority with respect to the minor child’s education, including but not limited to: school enrollment and attendance, participation in tutoring or other academic supports, and coordination with school personnel regarding attendance and academic planning, while leaving other aspects of joint legal custody in place to the extent the Court deems appropriate and workable.

C. Modify the existing parenting-time schedule so that, during the school year (or such period as the Court deems appropriate), Father shall not have Sunday overnights, and his parenting time shall end no later than a specified time on Sunday that allows the child to return to Mother’s care so that Mother can ensure the child attends school on Monday.

   OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, that:

   - The Court impose explicit conditions on Father’s Sunday overnight parenting time providing that the child must attend school on Monday absent a bona fide medical reason supported by appropriate documentation, and that repeated failure to ensure the child’s Monday attendance may result in further modification or reduction of Father’s Sunday overnight parenting time.

D. Order that both parents comply with school attendance laws and policies, promptly communicate with each other regarding absences and academic concerns, and cooperate fully with the child’s school and any agreed-upon or court-ordered academic support services.

E. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,

JESSICA THOMPSON,
