It does not discuss or decide what would be required if the defendant had itself created the hazard; instead, it focuses on whether the substance was present long enough and visible enough that the defendant should have known of and removed it. Thus, it neither states nor implies that notice is unnecessary when the defendant creates the hazard.",
