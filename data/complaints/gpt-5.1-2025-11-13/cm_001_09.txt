________________________________ )



NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Michael Smith (“Defendant” or “Father”), and respectfully states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children who are the subject of this action.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children who are the subject of this action.

3. The parties are the parents of two minor children:  
   a. Ethan Smith, born [REDACTED – 8 years old]; and  
   b. Emma Smith, born [REDACTED – 6 years old]  
   (collectively, the “Children”).

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 29, and related provisions governing custody and parenting plans, as the prior custody and parenting-time orders were issued by this Court and the Children reside in Massachusetts.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

5. On or about June 15, 2020, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2020 Order”) concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the Children.

6. Under the 2020 Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Children, with the Plaintiff having primary physical custody.

7. Under the 2020 Order, the Defendant was granted parenting time consisting generally of:  
   a. Every other weekend; and  
   b. One overnight per week on a weekday.

8. The 2020 Order was entered based on the circumstances existing at that time, including the parties’ then-current work schedules, which were regular daytime jobs and allowed the Defendant to be personally available for his court-ordered parenting time, including overnights.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since the entry of the 2020 Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances as that term is used in Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the caselaw interpreting it, such as *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

10. Specifically, after the 2020 Order, the Defendant accepted a new job position that requires him to work overnight shifts from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights when he is scheduled to exercise overnight parenting time pursuant to the 2020 Order.

11. The Defendant’s current work schedule is inconsistent with his ability to personally care for the Children during many of his court-ordered overnights and was not contemplated at the time of the 2020 Order.

12. As a result of this new schedule, the Defendant has, on numerous occasions, either:
    a. Returned or delivered the Children to the Plaintiff’s residence with very little or no advance notice, stating that he is too tired after his overnight shift to adequately care for the Children; and/or  
    b. Left the Children in the care of his roommate, an individual whom the Plaintiff barely knows and with whom the Children do not have a long-standing parental or caretaking relationship.

13. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that they sometimes fall asleep on the couch or in the living area while the Defendant naps after returning home from work, rather than being actively supervised by a rested adult.

14. The repeated last-minute changes, drop-offs, and reliance on a non-parent roommate for care during scheduled overnights have caused instability and disruption to the Children’s routines, sleep schedules, and sense of security.

15. The Plaintiff has attempted in good faith to accommodate the Defendant’s employment changes and to ensure that the Children are safe and adequately supervised, but the pattern of late notice, disrupted overnights, and inconsistent caregiving has continued.

16. The Children are now older (approximately 8 and 6 years old) than they were at the time of the 2020 Order, and their needs with respect to school routines, sleep, and emotional stability have evolved accordingly, further reinforcing the need to reassess and modify the existing parenting-time schedule in light of current circumstances. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (child’s maturation and changing needs can constitute material change).

17. Taken together, the Defendant’s changed work schedule, his inability to be physically present and awake for many of his ordered overnights, and his reliance on a third party of limited familiarity to the Plaintiff and the Children constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2020 Order, within the meaning of Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

18. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in custody and parenting-time matters is the best interests of the child. See *G.L. c. 208, § 28*; *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232, 233–34 (1981); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44; *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

19. When a material change in circumstances occurs after a prior custody or parenting-time judgment, the Court may and should modify the order if modification is in the children’s best interests. *See G.L. c. 208, § 28;* *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. at 546; *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 151–52; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–63.

20. Stability, safety, consistent routines, and adequate supervision during overnight hours are critical components of the Children’s best interests, particularly during school years. *See Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (courts consider stability of environment and caretaker availability); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998).

21. The Defendant’s overnight work schedule means that, on many of the evenings when the Children are presently scheduled to stay with him overnight, he is either:
    a. Physically absent from the home because he is working; or  
    b. Returning home from a 12-hour overnight shift, exhausted and unable to provide active and attentive care.

22. The practice of leaving the Children in the care of the Defendant’s roommate, who is not a parent and whom the Plaintiff scarcely knows, during overnight hours significantly deviates from the assumptions underlying the 2020 Order—namely, that the Defendant himself would be present, rested, and able to provide primary supervision during his parenting time.

23. The Plaintiff has primary physical custody and is regularly available to supervise the Children overnight, including on school nights, and to maintain consistent bedtime routines, morning routines, and school attendance.

24. It is in the Children’s best interests that overnight parenting time occur only when the parent exercising that time is actually available, not working overnight, and able to be awake, present, and directly responsible for the Children’s care.

25. The Plaintiff is not seeking to eliminate the Defendant’s relationship with the Children but rather to adjust the schedule so that the Children are with the Defendant during times when he can safely, personally, and consistently care for them, and so that the Children’s overnights are stable, predictable, and supervised by a parent.

26. Reasonable modification of the existing plan is therefore necessary to protect and advance the Children’s best interests, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the principles set forth in *Felton*, *Custody of Kali*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Smith v. McDonald*, and related cases.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

27. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 208, § 31 (defining legal and physical custody), G.L. c. 209C, § 10 (where applicable to custody and visitation), and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction, the Plaintiff seeks modification of the 2020 Order to conform to the current circumstances and the Children’s best interests.

28. The Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the 2020 Order to provide, in substance, that:

   a. **Joint Legal Custody**  
      The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody of the Children, as set forth in the 2020 Order, unless and until otherwise ordered by the Court.

   b. **Primary Physical Custody**  
      The Plaintiff shall continue to have primary physical custody of the Children.

   c. **Weekend Parenting Time (Non-Overnight-Work Weekends)**  
      The Defendant shall continue to have parenting time on alternating weekends, from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m. if there is no school) until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., **only on weekends when the Defendant is not scheduled to work overnight (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) on either the Friday night or Saturday night of that weekend.**

   d. **Adjustment for Weekends with Overnight Work**  
      For any weekend during which the Defendant is scheduled to work overnight on either Friday night or Saturday night (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), the Defendant’s parenting time for that weekend shall be adjusted so that:
      - The Defendant shall have daytime parenting time on Saturday and/or Sunday, as agreed by the parties or ordered by the Court, but  
      - The Children shall return to the Plaintiff’s residence for all overnight periods during that weekend.

   e. **Weekday Overnight Parenting Time**  
      The Defendant’s midweek overnight parenting time shall be modified so that the Defendant shall have one midweek visit (e.g., from after school until 8:00 p.m.), **without an overnight**, on a weekday when he is not scheduled to work overnight, with the Children returning to the Plaintiff’s residence to sleep.

   f. **No Delegation of Overnights to Third Parties**  
      Overnight parenting time awarded to the Defendant shall be exercised by the Defendant personally and shall **not** routinely be delegated to a roommate, friend, or other third-party caretaker in lieu of the Defendant, except in unforeseen emergencies or occasional, brief situations, consistent with the Children’s best interests.

   g. **Advance Notice of Work Schedule**  
      The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with a copy of, or access to, his work schedule (or written notice of his overnight shifts) at least fourteen (14) days in advance, and shall promptly inform the Plaintiff of any changes, so that parenting time can be planned in a manner that ensures the Defendant is actually available during his scheduled time with the Children.

   h. **Right of First Refusal for Overnights**  
      If at any time the Defendant is unable to personally care for the Children during his scheduled overnight periods due to work or fatigue from overnight work, the Plaintiff shall have the right of first refusal to care for the Children during those overnights before any third-party caregiver is used.

   i. **Such Further or Different Parenting Schedule**  
      The Court may adopt such further or different parenting-time schedule as it deems appropriate, consistent with the Children’s best interests, including further clarification of weekday visitation, holiday, school vacation, and summer parenting time, in light of the Defendant’s overnight work schedule.

29. The requested modification does not materially alter the legal-custody arrangement and is narrowly tailored to address the material changes in the Defendant’s work schedule, his actual ability to be present with the Children, and the need to ensure the Children’s safety and stability during overnight hours.

30. The requested modification is in the Children’s best interests under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and is supported by Massachusetts precedent governing custody and parenting-time modifications, including *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2020 custody and parenting-time order, including but not limited to the Defendant’s change to an overnight work schedule and his resulting inability to personally supervise the Children during many of his scheduled overnights;

C. Issue a Modified Judgment and/or Order that:

   1. Confirms joint legal custody of the Children, with the Plaintiff continuing as the parent with primary physical custody;

   3. Converts the existing midweek overnight to a midweek visit without an overnight, with the Children returning to the Plaintiff’s residence to sleep;

   4. Prohibits routine delegation of the Defendant’s overnights to roommates or other third parties, except for occasional, brief, or emergency situations consistent with the Children’s best interests;

   5. Requires the Defendant to provide timely advance notice of his overnight work schedule and any changes thereto;

   6. Establishes a right of first refusal for the Plaintiff for any overnight period that the Defendant is unable to personally cover due to his work schedule or fatigue resulting from overnight shifts;

   7. Sets forth any other detailed parenting-time provisions (including holidays, school vacations, and summer) the Court deems appropriate in light of the Defendant’s overnight work schedule and the Children’s best interests; and

D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor Children.



Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,  
JESSICA COLLINS,
