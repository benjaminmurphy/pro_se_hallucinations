      "support_reasoning": "The opinion focuses on parental unfitness and termination of parental rights in the context of severe abuse, but it does so under the G.L. c. 119 care and protection / adoption framework, not under G.L. c. 208 best\u2011interests custody standards. While the reasoning clearly treats the child\u2019s safety from abuse as paramount, the court does not articulate or analyze a general \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard under c. 208 \u00a7\u00a7 28 & 31. Thus, using this case as authority for the proposition about best\u2011interests analysis in the c. 208 custody context is indirect at best rather than a clear, on\u2011point support.",
