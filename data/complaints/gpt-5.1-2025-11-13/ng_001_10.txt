EMILY RODRIGUEZ,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Civil Action No. __________  

SOMERVILLE GROCERS, INC.,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation doing business as a retail grocery store, with a principal place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, operated, managed, and controlled the grocery store located at 123 Main Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Store”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action sounding in negligence arising out of personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff on or about September 16, 2023, at the Store located in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, such that the Superior Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4.

5. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and/or 8 because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County and the Store where the incident occurred is located in Middlesex County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On Saturday, September 16, 2023, at approximately mid-afternoon, Plaintiff lawfully entered the Store as a business invitee to purchase groceries.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant, by and through its officers, employees, agents, and/or servants, owned, operated, managed, maintained, and controlled the Store, including its aisles, floors, and premises open to the public.

8. While walking in the dairy aisle of the Store, Plaintiff stepped into a substantial puddle of spilled milk on the floor.

9. The puddle of milk was not small or difficult to see; cart tracks could be seen running through the puddle, indicating that multiple customers had already passed through the spill.

10. There were no caution signs, cones, “wet floor” signs, barriers, or any other warnings placed in or around the puddle of spilled milk.

11. The floor in the area of the dairy aisle appeared to be otherwise normal and dry, and there was nothing to alert Plaintiff to the presence of the hazard before she stepped into it.

12. As a direct result of stepping into the puddle of spilled milk, Plaintiff slipped and fell hard onto her hip on the Store’s floor.

13. Immediately prior to Plaintiff’s fall, a Store employee was stocking shelves in the dairy aisle approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the puddle.

14. After Plaintiff fell, the Store employee came over to her and stated, in substance, that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but was finishing what he was doing before he was going to get the mop.

15. The employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant, through its employee, had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition and failed to take timely and reasonable steps to either remedy it or warn customers.

16. At no time before the fall did any employee of Defendant warn Plaintiff about the spilled milk, block off the area, or otherwise take reasonable measures to protect customers from the hazard.

17. Following her fall, Plaintiff experienced pain and discomfort in her hip but attempted to complete her shopping.

18. That evening, Plaintiff’s hip pain significantly worsened.

19. On or about the next day, Plaintiff presented to an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain.

20. As part of her treatment, Plaintiff was prescribed and underwent a course of physical therapy.

21. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses, including urgent care evaluation and physical therapy.

22. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work certain shifts at her café job and lost approximately $800 in wages.

23. In addition to her medical expenses and lost wages, Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience pain, suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

24. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to keep the Store’s premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect her from unreasonable risks of harm that Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known about.

25. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, created, knew of, or should have known of the dangerous condition created by the spilled milk and the failure to clean it up or warn customers within a reasonable time.

26. The presence of cart tracks through the puddle indicates that the spilled milk existed on the floor for a sufficient period of time prior to Plaintiff’s fall that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care and proper inspection procedures, should have discovered and remedied the condition.

27. The Store employee’s admission that he had observed the spill “a few minutes ago” but chose to finish stocking shelves before addressing the spill shows that Defendant had actual notice of the condition and unreasonably delayed in responding to it.

28. Defendant failed to implement and/or follow adequate policies, procedures, and training for routine inspection, maintenance, and timely cleanup of spills and other hazards on the Store’s floors.

29. Defendant failed to adequately supervise its employees to ensure that known hazards were promptly addressed and that customers were protected from foreseeable slip and fall incidents.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped, fell, and suffered the injuries and damages described herein.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(NEGLIGENCE)

31. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, a store owner owes a duty to lawful business invitees to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect them against foreseeable risks of harm. *See, e.g.*, **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47, 52–53 (1983); **Thorson v. Mandell**, 402 Mass. 744, 747 (1988).

33. A landowner or possessor of land has a duty to act as a reasonable person in maintaining the property for the safety of lawful visitors, and may be held liable where it knows or should know of a dangerous condition and fails to take reasonable steps to correct or warn. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707–708 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 372–377 (2010).

34. In premises-liability cases involving transient substances on floors, a plaintiff may establish negligence by showing that the owner or its employees caused the hazard, had actual knowledge of it, or that the hazard existed for such a length of time that the owner should have discovered and remedied it in the exercise of reasonable care. *See* **Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.**, 332 Mass. 560, 562 (1955); **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165, 167–168 (1973).

35. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to:

   a. conduct reasonable and regular inspections of the Store’s aisles and floors;

   b. promptly clean up spills and other hazards that it knew or should have known about;

   c. warn customers of known or reasonably discoverable hazards, including by placing cones, signs, or other visible warnings around a known spill; and

   d. train and supervise employees to promptly address known spills and to prioritize customer safety over routine shelving tasks.

36. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, breached its duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, including but not limited to:

   a. failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk after actual knowledge of the spill;

   b. failing to post or place any warning signs, cones, or barriers around the spill despite actual or constructive knowledge of the hazard;

   c. failing to conduct reasonable inspections of the dairy aisle and Store premises so as to timely discover and remedy the spilled milk;

   d. allowing the spilled milk to remain on the floor for an unreasonable period of time, as evidenced by the presence of cart tracks through the puddle;

   e. failing to train and supervise employees to promptly respond to known hazardous conditions and to prioritize safety over stocking shelves;

   f. failing to adopt and/or implement reasonable policies and procedures for inspection, maintenance, and immediate cleanup of spills; and

   g. otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to maintain the Store in a reasonably safe condition.

37. The Store employee’s statement that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but delayed action to finish his work constitutes an admission of actual notice and failure to take reasonable and timely remedial measures. *See* **Black v. Boston Consol. Gas Co.**, 325 Mass. 505, 507–508 (1950) (actual knowledge and failure to act can establish negligence).

38. The condition of the floor—a visible puddle of milk with cart tracks running through it in a busy aisle—was an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to customers who would be walking through the area. *See* **Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.**, 343 Mass. 263, 264–265 (1961) (storeowner liable where foreign substance on floor was reasonably discoverable and not remedied).

39. Defendant’s failure to remedy or warn of a known or reasonably discoverable danger constitutes a breach of the duty of reasonable care owed under Massachusetts tort law, including the common‑law standard of ordinary care and G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence standard). *See* **Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901–902 (1987) (evidence that substance was on floor long enough for constructive notice sufficient to go to jury).

40. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for the acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and/or servants under the doctrine of respondeat superior and vicarious liability. *See* **Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.**, 438 Mass. 317, 322–323 (2002).

41. Defendant’s breaches of duty described above were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. A reasonable storeowner in Defendant’s position would have foreseen that a customer could slip and fall on spilled milk left on the floor without warning. *See* **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.**, 376 Mass. 101, 103–104 (1978) (foreseeability central to duty and causation analysis).

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries including, but not limited to, a hip sprain requiring medical treatment and physical therapy, accompanied by pain, suffering, and functional limitations.

43. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in an amount of approximately $1,200 and lost wages in an amount of approximately $800.

44. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, mental and emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, and may in the future incur additional expenses and suffer additional damages that are continuing in nature. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540, 547–548 (1982) (recognizing recovery for pain, suffering, and emotional distress arising from physical injury).

45. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 85 and 85K (to the extent applicable), Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages diminished, if at all, only in accordance with principles of comparative negligence, and Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was less than 51% of the total negligence that proximately contributed to her injuries.

46. Plaintiff brings this negligence claim solely under Massachusetts common law and applicable statutes, and seeks compensatory damages for all injuries and losses legally caused by Defendant’s conduct.

---

### V. DAMAGES

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, the following damages, among others:

   a. Past medical expenses of approximately $1,200, including urgent care and physical therapy;

   b. Past lost wages of approximately $800 due to missed work shifts at her café job;

   c. Past and future pain and suffering;

   d. Past and future loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of activities of daily living;

   e. Emotional distress associated with the injury, treatment, and limitations on daily activities; and

   f. Such additional special and general damages as will be proven at trial.

48. Plaintiff is entitled to recover pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest on any award pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, as applicable, as well as her taxable costs.

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND

49. Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable law, Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc., and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be in excess of $50,000, for Plaintiff’s medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and all other compensable injuries and losses;

B. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C;
