                   COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
                 (Negligence – Personal Injury – Premises Liability)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Café Delight (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                              I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all times relevant, Plaintiff was a paying customer and business invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located in Quincy, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Café Delight is, upon information and belief, a business entity organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal place of business at or including the premises located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169 (the “Premises”).

3. At all times relevant, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, and/or controlled the Premises and was responsible for its maintenance, safety, and the training and supervision of its employees and agents.

                      II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence under Massachusetts law.

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, given Plaintiff’s medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages.

6. Venue is proper in Norfolk Superior Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County at the Premises located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169, and Defendant transacts business in Norfolk County.

7. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is located in, conducts substantial business in, and/or maintains the Premises in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred there. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

                          III. JURY DEMAND

8. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60 and Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

                        IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

9. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises of Café Delight at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, MA 02169, as a paying customer having dinner.

10. Plaintiff was a business invitee to whom Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of dangers that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–709 (1973); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 372–373 (2010).

11. The Premises includes a narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, through which customers, servers, and other staff traverse to access the restroom and other areas.

12. Shortly before Plaintiff’s fall, a server employed by Defendant was carrying a tray with several water glasses in the hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.

13. The server dropped the tray, causing the glasses to fall and shatter on the hallway’s tile floor and causing water and ice to spill onto the floor (the “Spill”).

14. Defendant’s server quickly picked up and removed pieces of broken glass from the floor but left a substantial amount of water and ice on the tile floor in the hallway.

15. Defendant’s server stated words to the effect that she would “be right back with a mop,” acknowledging the existence of the Spill and the need to clean it.

16. Defendant’s employees and agents failed to promptly mop up, dry, or otherwise remove the water and ice from the hallway floor.

17. Defendant’s employees and agents failed to place any warning sign, “wet floor” sign, cone, barrier, or other warning device to alert customers or staff to the existence of the wet, slippery condition in the hallway.

18. Approximately ten (10) minutes after the Spill occurred, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom and walked into the hallway connecting the dining room and kitchen.

19. At that time, the floor in the hallway remained wet from the water and ice spilled from the dropped tray and had not been dried, cleaned, or cordoned off by Defendant’s employees.

20. The tile floor was glistening, but given the lighting, reflections, and appearance of the tile, Plaintiff reasonably believed the shininess was the normal appearance of the floor rather than standing water.

21. As Plaintiff stepped into the hallway, she unknowingly stepped onto the wet portion of the tile floor.

22. Because of the presence of water and/or ice left on the tile floor without remediation and without warnings, the floor was unreasonably slippery and dangerous.

23. As Plaintiff placed her weight onto her foot in the area of the Spill, her foot slipped out from under her, causing her to fall and violently twist her knee.

24. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in her knee and had difficulty standing and walking.

25. After the incident, Plaintiff overheard Defendant’s staff members state that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, indicating that the hazardous condition had existed for a sufficient period of time for Defendant’s employees to know about it, appreciate the danger, and act to correct or warn against it.

26. Defendant, through its employees and agents, had actual knowledge of the Spill because the server personally created the hazard by dropping the tray, observed the water and ice on the floor, and verbally acknowledged the need to clean it.

27. Alternatively, Defendant had constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition because the Spill was created by Defendant’s own employee in the course of her work, and the hazardous condition remained on the floor for at least approximately ten (10) minutes without being remedied, during which time multiple employees traversed the area and avoided the puddle. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 785–789 (2007).

28. Defendant, through its employees and agents, failed to exercise reasonable care to promptly and thoroughly clean up the Spill and to dry the hallway floor after the tray was dropped.

29. Defendant, through its employees and agents, failed to implement, follow, or enforce reasonable policies, procedures, and training to address spills and other transient hazards, particularly in high-traffic areas such as the hallway between the kitchen and the dining room.

30. Defendant, through its employees and agents, failed to adequately supervise and direct its staff to ensure that spills and slippery conditions were immediately remedied and that appropriate warnings were posted.

31. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that leaving water and ice on a smooth tile floor in a narrow, heavily used hallway created an unreasonable risk that patrons such as Plaintiff would slip and fall.

32. Defendant knew or should have known that patrons using the hallway to access the restroom would be reasonably distracted and would not necessarily be focused on the floor, especially where the reflective appearance of the tile could make water difficult to discern.

33. Defendant knew or should have known that a fall on a hard tile floor was likely to cause serious physical injury, including injuries to the knees, back, and other body parts.

34. At all times, Plaintiff acted reasonably and exercised due care for her own safety under the circumstances.

35. Plaintiff did not know of the dangerous condition and had no reasonable way to appreciate the full extent of the risk posed by the wet tile floor before stepping on it.

36. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions described herein, Plaintiff slipped, fell, and sustained a sprained knee requiring medical treatment, including the use of a knee brace and a course of physical therapy.

37. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility, where she was examined, diagnosed with a sprained knee, and prescribed treatment, including the use of a brace, rest, and follow-up therapy.

38. Plaintiff underwent weeks of physical therapy and rehabilitation to address pain, weakness, and limitations in mobility resulting from the knee injury.

39. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500 for urgent care visits, diagnostic evaluation, brace, physical therapy, and related medical services.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to time missed from work, limitations on her ability to perform her job duties, and medically necessary restrictions.

41. Plaintiff has experienced physical pain and suffering, including acute pain immediately following the fall and ongoing discomfort and limitations over the weeks of recovery and treatment.

42. Plaintiff has experienced emotional distress and mental anguish associated with the fall, pain, reduced mobility, disruption of daily activities, and concern about long-term effects.

43. Plaintiff suffered a loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of her ability to participate in normal activities, recreation, and work during the period of her injury and recovery.

44. Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to properly address and warn of the hazardous condition in the hallway.

45. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused by Defendant’s negligence and not by any negligence or fault of Plaintiff.

46. To the extent any negligence is attributed to Plaintiff— which she denies—any such negligence was substantially less than that of Defendant, and Plaintiff’s recovery is therefore not barred under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85.

                       V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                   NEGLIGENCE (PREMISES LIABILITY)

47. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 46 as if fully set forth herein.

48. Under Massachusetts common law, a person or entity that owns, occupies, or controls property owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful entrants to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including likelihood of injury, probable seriousness of injury, and burden of avoiding the risk. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–709 (1973); Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206, 228 (1978).

49. Defendant, as the owner, operator, occupier, and/or controller of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a lawful business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to:

   a. Maintain the Premises, including the hallway between the kitchen and dining room, in a reasonably safe condition;  
   b. Inspect the Premises and identify dangerous conditions, including spills and slippery surfaces;  
   c. Promptly remedy and/or neutralize dangerous conditions once known or reasonably knowable; and  
   d. Warn Plaintiff of dangerous conditions that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about, and that Plaintiff was unlikely to discover on her own. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 373–374 (2010); Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 785–789 (2007).

50. Where a defect or hazard is created by the defendant or its employees, Massachusetts law permits the factfinder to infer notice from the defendant’s own conduct, and explicit proof of the length of time the danger existed is not required. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 786–787; Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–265 (1961).

51. Defendant, through its employee, affirmatively created the hazardous condition by dropping the tray of water glasses, causing water and ice to spill on the tile floor of the hallway.

52. Because Defendant, through its employee, created the dangerous condition, Defendant had actual notice of the hazard and a heightened duty to act reasonably to eliminate the risk or adequately warn invitees. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 785–786; Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc., 471 Mass. 679, 682–685 (2015).

53. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:

   a. Failing to promptly and reasonably clean and dry the water and ice on the hallway floor after the tray was dropped;  
   b. Failing to place a “wet floor” sign, cone, barrier, or other visible warning around the Spill;  
   c. Allowing a known, slippery condition to exist in a narrow, highly trafficked hallway for at least approximately ten (10) minutes;  
   d. Failing to adequately supervise its employees to ensure that spills were handled in a timely and safe manner;  
   e. Failing to adopt, implement, and enforce reasonable policies and procedures for addressing spills and transient hazards in customer areas; and  
   f. Failing to take any alternative or interim safety measures (such as guarding off the hallway, redirecting customers, or stationing an employee to warn patrons) until the Spill was fully remedied.

54. Defendant’s conduct in leaving water and ice on the tile floor in a narrow hallway, without any warning, after actual knowledge of the Spill, fell below the standard of care of a reasonably prudent restaurant owner or operator under similar circumstances. See Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 166–167 (1973) (standard is that of an ordinarily prudent person in similar circumstances); Uloth v. City Tank Corp., 376 Mass. 874, 883 (1978).

55. Massachusetts law does not require Plaintiff to prove the exact fraction of time the dangerous condition existed where, as here, Defendant’s own employee created the condition and there is direct and circumstantial evidence of knowledge and inaction. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 785–789; Bowers v. P. Wile’s, Inc., 475 Mass. 34, 41–44 (2016).

56. Defendant also failed to warn Plaintiff of the hidden danger, despite having actual knowledge of the Spill and its slippery nature, and despite knowing that patrons, including Plaintiff, would use the hallway to access the restroom. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154–155 (2013) (duty includes obligation to warn of unreasonable dangers).

57. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that leaving water and ice on the floor in a high-traffic hallway without cleaning or warning would result in a patron slipping, falling, and suffering bodily injuries. See Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–106 (1978) (foreseeability of harm central to duty and breach).

58. Defendant’s breaches of duty were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip, fall, and resulting knee injury. But for Defendant’s failure to clean and warn, Plaintiff would not have slipped and fallen.

59. Plaintiff’s injuries were within the scope of the foreseeable risk created by Defendant’s negligent failure to remedy or warn about the Spill, and there was no intervening, superseding cause as a matter of law. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–150 (2006).

60. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages:

   a. Past medical expenses of approximately $2,500 for urgent care, evaluation, brace, and physical therapy;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to time off work necessitated by the injury and treatment;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering, both past and continuing;  
   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and mental anguish;  
   e. Loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of daily and recreational activities; and  
   f. Other consequential and incidental damages to be proven at trial.

61. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on the damages awarded from the date this action is commenced.

62. Pursuant to applicable law, including G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, Plaintiff is entitled to post‑judgment interest, and to taxable costs as allowed by law and rule.

63. Nothing in this Complaint should be construed as alleging any claim other than negligence; Plaintiff asserts negligence only.

                           VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Café Delight, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but in a sum sufficient to compensate Plaintiff fully and fairly for:

   1. Past and future medical expenses;  
   2. Past and future lost wages and/or impairment of earning capacity;  
   3. Past and future pain and suffering;  
   4. Emotional distress and mental anguish; and  
   5. Loss of enjoyment of life and other consequential damages;

B. Prejudgment interest as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C. Post‑judgment interest as provided by law;

D. Costs of this action, including filing fees and other taxable costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 261 and applicable rules;

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                             VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby reiterates her demand for a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025  

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,
