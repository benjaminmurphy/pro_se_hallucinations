COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 25 Cedar Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual and the owner and/or lessor of the residential premises located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302 (the “Premises”). On information and belief, Defendant is engaged in the business of renting residential property in Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 21 because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 & 8 because the Premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02302.

6. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises since on or about January 15, 2022, and has paid rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,500 per month.

7. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been a lawful tenant in good standing and has complied with her material obligations under the tenancy, including the obligation to pay rent.

8. Defendant, as landlord, is responsible for maintaining the Premises in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., and other applicable laws and regulations, including the obligation to provide adequate hot water.

9. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.190 (formerly 410.190, 410.200 & 410.201), an owner must provide and maintain facilities for hot water in every dwelling unit, and the hot water must be available at all times at a temperature and in a manner consistent with the Code.

10. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law implies into every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects tenants from serious interference with the use and enjoyment of their premises caused by the landlord or by the landlord’s failure to fulfill legal duties.

11. Around early November 2025, approximately three weeks prior to the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment ceased functioning, resulting in a complete loss of hot water in the Premises.

12. The same day the hot water failed, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water. Plaintiff immediately informed Defendant that there was no hot water in the apartment.

13. Defendant responded that the water heater required a part and that he had ordered the necessary part.

14. Approximately one week after Plaintiff’s initial complaint, Plaintiff still had no hot water. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant, who informed her that the part was backordered.

15. Approximately two weeks after the hot water failed, Plaintiff remained without hot water. Defendant again told Plaintiff that the part was still backordered and that he was “working on it.”

16. As of the filing of this Complaint—approximately three weeks after the loss of hot water—Plaintiff continues to have no functioning hot water in her apartment.

17. Throughout this three‑week period, Plaintiff has been forced to live without hot water, taking cold showers, boiling water on the stove to wash dishes, and altering her daily life to attempt to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation.

18. Plaintiff has been compelled to purchase a gym membership for the primary purpose of accessing hot showers, at a cost of approximately $30 per month, in addition to gasoline and travel costs to get to and from the gym.

19. Plaintiff has also been compelled to take her infant child to her mother’s home in order to bathe the child in safe, warm water, because the lack of hot water in the Premises renders it impractical and unsafe to bathe a baby there.

20. The absence of hot water for bathing, cleaning, and general hygiene has caused Plaintiff significant discomfort, inconvenience, disruption, and stress, and has materially interfered with the normal and reasonable use of her home.

21. The complete loss of hot water for a period of weeks constitutes a serious housing condition and a violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190, and therefore a violation of Defendant’s statutory and common‑law duties as a landlord. See e.g., Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord’s failure to comply with the State Sanitary Code is a breach of warranty of habitability and can support other tenant remedies).

22. Despite repeated notice from Plaintiff and the passage of several weeks, Defendant has failed to restore hot water to the Premises or otherwise provide Plaintiff with an alternative lawful accommodation (such as a substitute unit) that provides adequate hot water.

23. Plaintiff has no control over the building’s water heating equipment and is dependent on Defendant to repair or replace the water heating system as required by law.

24. Defendant’s failure, over a period of weeks, to restore hot water to the Premises, after notice of the condition, constitutes an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

25. Defendant’s actions and inactions have forced Plaintiff to incur out‑of‑pocket expenses, including but not limited to: gym membership fees for showers, additional travel/gas expenses, and related costs, and have diminished the value of the rental premises during the period of the loss of hot water.

26. Based on the problems described and the period of time without hot water, Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $450 in actual damages, including but not limited to the decreased rental value of the apartment during the period of no hot water and consequential expenses related to hygiene and bathing for herself and her child.

27. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

28. At $1,500 per month in rent, three months’ rent equals $4,500, which is greater than Plaintiff’s actual damages of approximately $450. Accordingly, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover at least $4,500 in statutory damages, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, regardless of whether she is represented by counsel.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
G.L. c. 186, § 14**

29. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 28 above as if fully set forth herein.

30. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

31. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s failure to provide essential services required by law, including heat and hot water, after notice, may constitute an interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977).

32. The covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is violated where the landlord’s conduct, or failure to act in the face of a legal duty, results in a serious interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982).

33. A violation of the State Sanitary Code that results in significant impairment of the tenant’s use of the premises can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–01 (1979); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–77 (1994).

34. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190 and related provisions, requires owners to provide and maintain adequate facilities for hot water in every dwelling unit, and the failure to do so constitutes a violation of the Code. See also 105 C.M.R. 410.351, 410.300 et seq.

35. Defendant, as owner and landlord of the Premises, has a statutory duty under G.L. c. 186, § 14, the State Sanitary Code (105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.), and the common law to provide Plaintiff with safe, sanitary, and habitable premises, including the provision of adequate hot water.

36. Defendant received actual notice from Plaintiff, starting approximately three weeks before this Complaint was filed, that there was no hot water in her apartment.

37. Despite such notice, Defendant failed, within a reasonable period of time, to restore hot water or to take effective steps to provide equivalent safe and lawful accommodations to Plaintiff.

38. The loss of hot water for an extended period of approximately three weeks is a serious defect affecting Plaintiff’s ability to bathe herself and her child, wash dishes, and maintain basic hygiene, and it renders the Premises significantly below the standard of habitability required by Massachusetts law.

39. Defendant’s failure, over a substantial period of time and despite notice, to correct the loss of hot water is conduct that directly and indirectly interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

40. The covenant of quiet enjoyment does not require proof that Defendant acted with bad faith or malice; it is sufficient that Defendant’s acts or omissions, in violation of his legal duties, caused a serious interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–06.

41. Even where a landlord claims to be “trying” to fix a problem, a prolonged and unremedied lack of essential services, such as hot water, after notice, constitutes an unreasonable interference with quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 784–87 (1994) (landlord liable where conditions persisted despite alleged attempts to address them).

42. The substantial loss of hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment over several weeks has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy her home as a reasonable tenant would.

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including, but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of a habitable apartment with functioning hot water;  
   b. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises during the period of the loss of hot water;  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses, including gym membership fees and gas/travel expenses to shower elsewhere; and  
   d. Inconvenience, discomfort, and disruption associated with being unable to bathe herself and her child with hot water at home.

44. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Given that Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500, Plaintiff is entitled to not less than $4,500 in statutory damages.

45. Massachusetts courts have consistently enforced the statutory remedy of at least three months’ rent for violations of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–77 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–06.

46. Plaintiff also seeks her costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees should she subsequently retain counsel, as expressly authorized by G.L. c. 186, § 14.
