### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY – BICYCLE “DOORING” COLLISION)

Plaintiff Jordan Mills (“Plaintiff” or “Mills”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Alex Johnson (“Defendant” or “Johnson”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Mills is an individual who, at all relevant times, resided in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Alex Johnson is an individual residing in Massachusetts, whose exact address is presently unknown to Plaintiff but who, at all relevant times, operated a motor vehicle within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including in the City of Boston, Suffolk County.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was the operator and/or bailee of a motor vehicle being used in connection with a rideshare service on a public way in Boston, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and the claims are for common‑law negligence.

5. Personal jurisdiction is proper under G.L. c. 223A, § 3 because Defendant transacted business and committed tortious acts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and Plaintiff’s causes of action arise from those acts.

6. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 & 2 because the cause of action arose in Suffolk County, at 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02134.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 15, 2023, at approximately [time unknown to Plaintiff], Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bicycle lane on Commonwealth Avenue near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02134.

8. Commonwealth Avenue at that location is a busy public street in Boston with designated bicycle lanes adjacent to the portion of the roadway used by motor vehicles and adjacent parking/loading areas.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was traveling in the correct direction with the flow of traffic, within the confines of the marked bicycle lane, and in a careful, prudent, and lawful manner.

10. Plaintiff was wearing a bicycle helmet and was attentive to surrounding traffic and conditions.

11. At the same time and place, Defendant was operating a motor vehicle associated with a rideshare service and had parked or stopped that vehicle in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the bicycle lane.

12. Defendant’s vehicle was positioned so that its front passenger‑side door bordered or intruded upon the area directly next to the bicycle lane used by cyclists, including Plaintiff.

13. Without first making a reasonable and adequate observation of oncoming bicycle traffic or checking his mirror, and while distracted by his phone, Defendant suddenly and forcefully opened the driver’s side door of his vehicle (or, alternatively, opened a door into the cyclist’s path) into the bicycle lane directly in front of Plaintiff.

14. Defendant swung the door open abruptly, into the space that Plaintiff was lawfully occupying and into the foreseeable path of bicycle travel.

15. Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to stop, swerve, or otherwise avoid the suddenly opened door, given the speed of travel, the proximity of the door’s movement, and the presence of other traffic and roadway conditions.

16. Plaintiff’s bicycle struck the edge of Defendant’s suddenly opened door, causing Plaintiff to be thrown from the bicycle and to land violently on the pavement.

17. As a direct result of this collision, Plaintiff sustained injuries including, but not limited to, road rash and abrasions on both arms and legs, and trauma to the mouth and teeth, including a chipped front tooth.

18. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and rendered unsafe or unusable, requiring replacement of the bicycle.

19. At the scene of the incident, Defendant admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was checking his phone.

20. Defendant’s admission is an admission of a party‑opponent and is admissible evidence of negligence and distraction.

21. Subsequently, when Plaintiff submitted a claim to Defendant’s automobile insurer, the insurer reported that Defendant alleged Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

22. Plaintiff denies, and on information and belief alleges to be false, Defendant’s later claim that Plaintiff was weaving in and out of traffic. Plaintiff was at all times riding in the marked bicycle lane, in a straight and predictable manner, consistent with applicable traffic laws and due care.

23. At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for his own safety, obeyed all traffic signals and laws, stayed within the designated bicycle lane, and did not engage in any conduct that would have contributed to the collision.

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff incurred and continues to incur medical expenses for treatment of his injuries.

25. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date are approximately $1,500, including, but not limited to, treatment for road rash, follow‑up medical visits, and dental treatment for the chipped front tooth.

26. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff missed time from work while recovering from his injuries and attending medical and dental appointments.

27. Plaintiff lost approximately $800 in wages due to his inability to work for a period following the collision.

28. Plaintiff also incurred property damage, including the cost of a replacement bicycle and related equipment, as his bicycle frame was bent in the collision and required replacement.

29. Plaintiff experienced and continues to experience physical pain, discomfort, and emotional distress as a result of the collision and his injuries.

30. Plaintiff has suffered, and may in the future suffer, additional harms and losses, including but not limited to, pain and suffering, scarring or residual symptoms, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, all as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence.

### IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

31. In Massachusetts, to prevail on a claim of negligence, a plaintiff must establish that: (a) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care; (b) the defendant breached that duty; (c) the plaintiff suffered damages; and (d) the defendant’s breach was the actual and proximate cause of those damages.  
 See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

32. Operators of motor vehicles in Massachusetts owe a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid foreseeable harm to others using the roadway, including bicyclists.  
 See **Lussier v. Boston Edison Co.**, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 984, 985 (1992) (duty of reasonable care); **G.L. c. 90, § 14** (duties toward others on the way).

33. Massachusetts statutes and regulations expressly recognize bicyclists as lawful users of public ways entitled to the protections of the rules of the road.  
 See **G.L. c. 85, §§ 11B–11B1/2** (governing operation of bicycles and rights and duties of bicyclists); **G.L. c. 89, § 1** (rules of the road).

34. Motorists and their passengers owe a duty not to open vehicle doors unsafely into traffic, including into bicycle lanes, and must ensure that it is reasonably safe to open a door before doing so, so as not to interfere with the movement of other traffic.  
 See **G.L. c. 90, § 14** (“No person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic…”).

35. Violations of safety statutes and regulations, including those codified in G.L. c. 90 and G.L. c. 85, constitute evidence of negligence.  
 See **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990); **Guinan v. Famous Players–Lasky Corp.**, 267 Mass. 501, 516 (1929).

36. Massachusetts also imposes a duty on all persons to act with reasonable care to avoid creating foreseeable risks of harm, including when engaging in ordinary activities such as opening car doors on public streets.  
 See **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996); **Flood v. Southland Corp.**, 416 Mass. 62, 66–67 (1993).

37. Distraction by cell phone use does not excuse a motorist’s failure to exercise reasonable care. A motorist is held to the standard of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances, including observance of obvious cyclists in an adjacent bike lane.  
 See **Swan v. United States**, 698 F. Supp. 2d 227, 234–35 (D. Mass. 2010) (applying Massachusetts negligence law).

38. Under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, any negligence by Plaintiff, if found, diminishes but does not bar recovery unless Plaintiff’s negligence exceeds the combined negligence of the defendant(s).  
 See **G.L. c. 231, § 85**; **Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.**, 403 Mass. 50, 58 (1988).

39. Determinations of negligence and comparative negligence are fact‑intensive inquiries typically reserved for the fact‑finder (the jury), rather than for resolution as a matter of law.  
 See **Mullins v. Pine Manor College**, 389 Mass. 47, 56–57 (1983); **Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401, 408 (1991).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST DEFENDANT ALEX JOHNSON)**

40. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 39 as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

41. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in the operation, stopping, and exiting of his motor vehicle, and in opening and maintaining the vehicle’s doors, so as to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others lawfully using the public way, including bicyclists traveling in the adjacent bicycle lane.  
 See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. at 146–47; **G.L. c. 90, § 14**; **G.L. c. 85, § 11B**.

42. Defendant also owed a statutory duty not to open his vehicle door on the side available to moving traffic unless it was reasonably safe to do so and could be done without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists.  
 See **G.L. c. 90, § 14**.

43. Defendant owed Plaintiff a further duty to maintain a proper lookout, to remain attentive and not distracted by his cell phone, and to act as a reasonably prudent driver would under the same or similar circumstances.

#### Breach

44. Defendant breached his duties of care by, among other acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to look for oncoming bicycles in the bike lane before opening his vehicle door;

   b. Failing to check his side and rearview mirrors, or otherwise properly observe traffic conditions, before opening the door into the bicycle lane;

   c. Opening his vehicle door suddenly and forcefully into the bicycle lane and directly into the path of Plaintiff’s oncoming bicycle;

   d. Failing to ensure that it was reasonably safe to open the vehicle door and that doing so would not interfere with the movement of other traffic, including bicycles, in violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14;

   e. Using or checking his cell phone while parked/stopped in such a manner that he was distracted and failed to perceive Plaintiff, despite Plaintiff’s presence in a clearly marked bicycle lane;

   f. Failing to exercise reasonable care for the safety of bicyclists and other roadway users; and

   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

45. Defendant’s admitted failure to see Plaintiff because he was checking his phone constitutes strong evidence of his failure to exercise reasonable care and his breach of the duty to maintain a proper lookout.

46. Defendant’s actions and omissions, as described above, constitute negligence under Massachusetts law.  
 See **Lussier**, 32 Mass. App. Ct. at 985; **Bennett**, 408 Mass. at 358; **Poskus**, 423 Mass. at 639–40.

#### Causation

47. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the collision between Plaintiff’s bicycle and Defendant’s vehicle door.

48. But for Defendant’s failure to check for oncoming bicyclists and his sudden opening of the door into the bicycle lane, Plaintiff would not have collided with the door, been thrown from his bicycle, or suffered the injuries and damages alleged herein.

49. The collision, Plaintiff’s resulting injuries, and the property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle were all foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent conduct.

50. No act or omission of Plaintiff was a superseding cause of the collision or Plaintiff’s injuries.

#### Damages

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries including, but not limited to, road rash and abrasions on his arms and legs, and a chipped front tooth.

52. Plaintiff incurred medical and dental expenses in an approximate amount of $1,500 for evaluation and treatment of his injuries, including treatment for abrasions and dental work for his chipped tooth.

53. Plaintiff lost approximately $800 in wages due to missed time from work for recovery and for attending medical and dental appointments.

54. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and rendered unsafe or unusable as a result of the collision, forcing Plaintiff to purchase a replacement bicycle, thereby causing property damage in an amount to be proven at trial.

55. Plaintiff endured and continues to endure physical pain, discomfort, and limitations resulting from his injuries.

56. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life arising from the collision and from the experience of being struck and thrown from his bicycle.

57. Plaintiff has suffered inconvenience, disruption of his daily activities, and other consequential damages as a result of his injuries.

58. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to: medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.  
 See **Haddad v. Gonzalez**, 410 Mass. 855, 867–68 (1991) (pain and suffering, lost earnings, and medical expenses recoverable in negligence); **Tuttle v. McGeeney**, 344 Mass. 200, 206–07 (1962) (property and personal injury damages).

59. To the extent that Defendant or his insurer contend Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies any such allegation. In any event, under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, any alleged negligence of Plaintiff, if found to exist, was not greater than the negligence of Defendant and would, at most, proportionately diminish but not bar Plaintiff’s recovery.
