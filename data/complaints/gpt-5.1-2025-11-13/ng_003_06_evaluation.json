      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not articulate a general rule that a plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, nor does it list or discuss the categories of damages (medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life) as a legal principle. The only discussion of damages appears in the context of reviewing whether a $440,000 verdict was excessive, describing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and consequences factually rather than setting out a doctrinal statement on recoverable elements of damage. Thus, doCanto is not proper authority for the broad damages proposition cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In concluding that the judge committed no error of law, we consider Ezila\u2019s age (twenty-nine) and weekly earnings ($140) at the time of the accident; the loss of ninety-five per cent of the function of her right hand (her dominant hand); her inability to perform many household tasks or to obtain employment; her pain and suffering, particularly while her hand was in the machine and while she was in the hospital where her fingers were amputated and skin grafts undertaken; her disfigurement, including scars from skin graft operations; her future need for artificial hands; and her continuing discomfort and embarrassment."

      "support_confidence": "medium",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion clearly establishes that Massachusetts slip-and-fall-on-ice cases are governed by common-law premises liability sounding in negligence and discusses general negligence principles, but it does not mention G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, nor does it explicitly tie the analysis to the comparative negligence statute. The case is therefore good authority for the negligence/common-law premises liability framing, but not specifically for the proposition that this action is informed by \u00a7 85. Any reference to \u00a7 85 would come only by general background assumption, not by express holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We now will apply to hazards arising from snow and ice the same obligation that a property owner owes to lawful visitors as to all other hazards: a duty to \u201cact as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk.\u201d Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162, 169 (1980) ... If a property owner knows or reasonably should know of a dangerous condition on its property... the property owner owes a duty to lawful visitors to make reasonable efforts to protect lawful visitors against the danger."
