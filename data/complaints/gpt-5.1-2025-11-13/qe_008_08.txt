---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

7. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment at **45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, MA 02150** (the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises since on or about June 1, 2022.

9. Plaintiff’s current monthly rent for the Premises is **$1,500.00**, which she has paid to Defendant as required by the tenancy.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant has owned, controlled, managed, and/or operated the Property and common areas, including the **main entry door**, hallways, and basement.

11. The main entry door to the building, which provides access from the street to the interior common areas (including the hallway where mail and packages are delivered and the stairways leading to the apartments), has had a **broken lock** and/or latch that does not function properly.

12. Because the lock does not latch properly, the main entry door can be pushed open by any person without a key or authorization, allowing **unrestricted access** to the interior of the building and common areas at all hours.

13. The defective main entry door lock has existed for at least approximately **two months** prior to the filing of this Complaint, and on information and belief for a significant period of time before that.

14. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the broken and insecure main entry door approximately **two months** prior to the filing of this Complaint, by informing him that the door did not latch and that anyone could simply push it open.

15. Defendant acknowledged the problem and stated that he would **“fix it”**, thereby recognizing his responsibility to maintain the security and condition of the main entry door and common areas.

16. Despite that acknowledgment, Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the lock or otherwise restore security to the main entry door within a reasonable time.

17. Plaintiff subsequently **reminded Defendant at least twice more** about the broken lock and her concerns about building security.

18. On each such occasion, Plaintiff informed Defendant that the door was still not latching properly and that unauthorized persons could and did enter the building.

19. Notwithstanding these repeated notices, Defendant did not arrange for any meaningful repair, replacement, or improvement of the main entry door lock, and the condition remained unsafe and unsecure.

20. Due to the defective lock and Defendant’s failure to secure the building, **unauthorized individuals** have been able to gain access to the common areas of the Property.

21. Approximately **one month** prior to this Complaint, one or more unknown persons entered the building, accessed the interior hallways, and **rifled through tenants’ mail and packages**.

22. As a result, **multiple tenants**, including Plaintiff, suffered **theft of packages** from the hallway.

23. Plaintiff had at least one package, valued at approximately **$120.00**, stolen from the hallway after such unauthorized entry.

24. The theft occurred after Plaintiff had already notified Defendant of the broken front door lock and after Defendant had failed to fix the condition.

25. Because of continuing concerns about intruders and the lack of building security, Plaintiff began to observe **evidence that someone has been sleeping in the basement**, including items and signs consistent with overnight occupancy by an unauthorized person.

26. The basement is part of the building’s **common areas** under Defendant’s control and is accessible via the unsecured main entry and interior hallways.

27. The presence of an unauthorized individual sleeping in the basement, together with the theft of mail and packages, has made Plaintiff feel **unsafe, anxious, and distressed** in her home.

28. Plaintiff reasonably fears for her personal safety, the safety of her property, and the security of her mail and packages.

29. The conditions created by the broken entry door lock and the resulting unauthorized access have **substantially interfered** with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment and the common areas.

30. In response to Defendant’s failure to secure the building, Plaintiff spent approximately **$200.00** of her own funds to purchase and install a **security camera** for her own apartment door and to install a **better deadbolt** lock on her apartment door.

31. These expenditures were reasonably necessary to mitigate the ongoing security risks and to protect herself and her property, given Defendant’s failure to repair the building’s main entry door and maintain secure common areas.

32. Plaintiff’s total out-of-pocket losses to date directly caused by Defendant’s failure to maintain the main entry door and provide reasonably secure common areas include at least:  
   a. **$120.00** for the stolen package; and  
   b. **$200.00** for the security camera and upgraded deadbolt for her apartment door;  
   for an aggregate of **$320.00**.

33. Plaintiff also has suffered **non-economic damages**, including fear, anxiety, emotional distress, and loss of peace of mind, as a result of living in a building where unauthorized persons repeatedly gain entry, mail is stolen, and someone appears to be sleeping in the basement.

34. When Plaintiff complained, Defendant told her she was **“overreacting”** and asserted that the neighborhood was safe, thereby **minimizing** the problem and refusing to take effective corrective measures.

35. Defendant has at all relevant times had **actual notice** of the defective main entry door lock, the risk of unauthorized entry, and the resulting problems, and has **failed to take reasonable steps** to correct the conditions.

36. At all times relevant, Plaintiff has paid her rent and **fulfilled her obligations** as a tenant.

37. The insecure main entry door and resulting intrusions, thefts, and unauthorized basement occupancy materially and **substantially impaired** Plaintiff’s ability to quietly enjoy and securely reside in the Premises.

38. Defendant’s ongoing failure to address the broken entry door lock and to secure the Property **constitutes an act or omission in violation of Plaintiff’s implied covenant of quiet enjoyment** under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

39. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

40. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes a **covenant of quiet enjoyment**, both implied and, in many cases, set forth in statute. See **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

41. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of any residential premises by the occupant.

42. That statute further provides that a landlord who so interferes “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” G.L. c. 186, § 14.

43. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is **broadly construed** to protect tenants from serious interferences with the use and enjoyment of their leased premises caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

44. In **Blackett v. Olanoff**, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s conduct (including omissions) that foreseeably results in substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment may constitute a breach, even where the landlord does not personally commit the disturbing acts, so long as they are a natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s control or lack of reasonable action.

45. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that **failure to maintain safe and secure conditions** in common areas, such as locks and entryways, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.,  
   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850–53 (1997) (affirming landlord liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 where conditions materially impaired tenant’s quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982) (recognizing that a landlord’s failure to remedy serious building problems affecting security and habitability can breach quiet enjoyment and support damages for emotional distress);  
   - **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 285–87 (1994) (discussing landlord’s duty to protect tenants from foreseeable criminal acts in common areas under certain circumstances).

46. The covenant of quiet enjoyment can be violated by **omissions** as well as affirmative acts where the landlord’s failure to act after notice foreseeably leads to substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See **Blackett**, 371 Mass. at 718; **Al-Ziab**, 424 Mass. at 851–52.

47. A landlord’s persistent failure to respond to **known security defects** in common areas, where such defects allow repeated intrusions, thefts, or other serious disturbances, has been held to substantially interfere with tenants’ rights to quiet enjoyment. See **Simon**, 385 Mass. at 102–06; see also **Young v. Patukonis**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (recognizing significance of landlord inaction after notice).

48. In addition, the duty to maintain common areas in a condition reasonably safe and fit for occupancy is reinforced by the **State Sanitary Code**, promulgated under **G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L**. See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 200–05 (1979) (sanitary code violations may support claims relating to habitability and quiet enjoyment).

49. Under the State Sanitary Code, landlords must maintain **secure entry doors and door hardware** and keep the premises in good repair. See **105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.**, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.480 (locks and security) and 410.500 (maintenance of common areas). Violations of the Code may constitute evidence of a breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Berman & Sons**, 379 Mass. at 200–05.

50. Defendant had **actual notice** of the defective and insecure main entry door lock for at least approximately two months prior to this action and failed to timely and adequately address the condition.

51. Defendant’s failure to repair or replace the lock and secure the main entry door is an **omission within his control**, and it was reasonably foreseeable that leaving the main door unsecured would permit unauthorized access, including theft and unauthorized occupancy of the building’s basement.

52. Defendant’s omission directly resulted in **repeated unauthorized entries**, theft of mail and packages, and the presence of an unauthorized person sleeping in the basement, all of which are serious invasions of the security, privacy, and habitability of the building.

53. These intrusions and related conditions are **substantial interferences** with Plaintiff’s right to quietly and safely enjoy her home and common areas, as contemplated by **G.L. c. 186, § 14** and the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment.

54. Plaintiff’s experience of living in a building with an unsecured entry, unauthorized intruders, mail theft, and evidence of someone sleeping in the basement is not a mere inconvenience; it is a **significant diminution** of her right to private, safe, and secure enjoyment of her tenancy.

55. Massachusetts courts recognize that **emotional distress** and mental anguish caused by a landlord’s ongoing failure to protect tenants from serious and persistent housing problems, including security problems, may be compensated as part of damages for breach of quiet enjoyment. See **Simon**, 385 Mass. at 102–06; **Al-Ziab**, 424 Mass. at 852–53.

56. Plaintiff has, in fact, suffered **emotional distress, anxiety, and fear** as a result of Defendant’s failure to secure the building, and such distress is a **reasonably foreseeable** consequence of living in a residence where intruders are known to come in, mail is stolen, and the landlord refuses to act.

57. Plaintiff has also incurred **out-of-pocket monetary damages**—including the loss of at least $120.00 in stolen property and at least $200.00 in expenditures for additional personal security measures—caused by Defendant’s failure to secure the building.

58. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, once a breach is established, a landlord is liable for the tenant’s actual and consequential damages **or** three months’ rent, **whichever is greater**, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

59. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is **$1,500.00**; therefore, three months’ rent equals **$4,500.00**.

60. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential monetary damages at this time total at least **$320.00**, excluding non-economic damages for emotional distress, fear, anxiety, and loss of peace of mind.

61. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff is entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 to recover **no less than three months’ rent ($4,500.00)**, plus costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees (if counsel is retained), regardless of whether her actual monetary loss is lower than three months’ rent. See **DiMarzo v. American Mut. Ins. Co.**, 389 Mass. 85, 101–02 (1983) (recognizing mandatory nature of multiple damages under certain remedial statutes); see also **Wolfberg v. Hunter**, 385 Mass. 390, 400 (1982).

62. Plaintiff brings this Complaint as a **self-represented litigant (pro se)**. If she later retains counsel, she will seek reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

63. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a **breach of the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment** and an unlawful indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Massachusetts case law (including **Blackett**, **Simon**, **Al-Ziab**, **Berman**, and others), and related statutory and regulatory provisions, including **105 C.M.R. 410.000** and **G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L**.
