      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns a minor child\u2019s recovery for physical pain and emotional distress from an incident, injury, and medical treatment. Payton v. Abbott Labs addresses whether Massachusetts allows recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress absent physical harm and sets out requirements for such claims, but it does not discuss a minor child\u2019s specific damages of physical pain, emotional distress, anxiety, and mental suffering from an injury and medical care. The case is about DES-exposed daughters\u2019 emotional-distress claims and prenatal injury, not about the scope of a child\u2019s pain-and-suffering damages from a discrete injury and its treatment, so it does not support the proposition as stated.",
