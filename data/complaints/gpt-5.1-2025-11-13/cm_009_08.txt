LAURA SMITH,  
    Plaintiff,  
v.  
MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Smith (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT  

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Smith, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, date of birth __________ (age 8).

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, currently having his primary residence in the area commonly known as Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the town where the child’s school is located.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and M.G.L. c. 215, § 6, as the original custody and parenting-time orders regarding the minor child were issued by this Court, the child has resided in Massachusetts at all relevant times, and a modification of a prior Probate and Family Court judgment is sought.

4. On or about August 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order regarding custody and parenting time (the “2019 Judgment”) between the parties concerning the minor child, Emily Johnson.

5. Under the 2019 Judgment, Mother was granted primary physical custody of the minor child, with Father awarded parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight each week on Wednesdays, with Father returning the child to school on Thursday mornings.

6. At the time the 2019 Judgment was entered, both parties resided in the same town, and the midweek overnight arrangement involved approximately a five-minute drive from Father’s then-residence to the child’s school on Thursday mornings.

7. Venue in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court is proper because this Court issued the original 2019 Judgment and because the child and at least one parent currently reside within the jurisdiction of this Court. See M.G.L. c. 215, § 6; M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.

II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES  

8. Since the entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor child, within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable caselaw, warranting modification of the parenting-time provisions.

9. After the 2019 Judgment, Father moved his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school.

10. Father nevertheless insists upon exercising the same weekly Wednesday overnight provided for in the 2019 Judgment, despite the fact that the parties no longer live in close proximity to one another or to the child’s school.

11. On Wednesdays, Father currently picks up the child from school, transports her approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence on Cape Cod, and then wakes the child at approximately 4:30 A.M. on Thursday mornings to drive her back approximately ninety (90) miles to attend school.

12. As a result of this schedule, the minor child routinely experiences significantly reduced and disrupted sleep on Wednesday nights, and must endure lengthy early-morning car rides on school days.

13. The child is frequently exhausted on Thursdays, which has negatively impacted her ability to focus, learn, and participate in her education.

14. The child’s teacher has reported a noticeable decline in the child’s participation and engagement in class on Thursdays, coinciding with the current Wednesday-overnight and early-morning commute arrangement.

15. The child has expressed fatigue and discomfort related to being awakened extremely early and traveling long distances on a school day.

16. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, the parties and the Court reasonably anticipated that the Wednesday overnight would not interfere with the child’s sleep, schooling, or general welfare, because the parties lived in the same town and the commute to school was short (approximately five minutes).

17. The substantial increase in travel distance, the resulting early-morning wake times, and the demonstrated negative impact on the child’s school functioning were not contemplated by the Court or the parties when the 2019 Judgment was entered.

18. Father’s relocation and the resulting change in the practical effect of the midweek overnight constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

19. The existing parenting-time schedule is no longer in the child’s best interests and must be modified to reflect the realities of Father’s relocation and the child’s evolving needs. See Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

III. APPLICABLE LAW  

20. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, “[u]pon a complaint after a divorce, the court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

21. Where the parties are not or were not married, an identical standard applies under M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, empowering the Court to modify custody and parenting time “as the best interests of the child may require” upon a material change in circumstances.

22. The controlling standard for any custody or parenting-time determination is the “best interests of the child.” See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003); Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986).

23. To modify a prior custody or parenting-time order, the moving party must show: (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior order; and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507, 511–12 (2013); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

24. Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly held that significant changes in a parent’s residence, the feasibility of the existing schedule, or the impact of existing arrangements on a child’s schooling and well-being can constitute a material change in circumstances warranting modification. See, e.g.:  
   a. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (modification proper where changed circumstances affected child’s welfare);  
   b. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (changes relating to parenting arrangements and children’s needs may justify modification);  
   c. Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (best interests standard governs; courts must focus on stability and welfare of the child);  
   d. Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 326 (2007) (considering distance between homes and its impact on child’s routine);  
   e. Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (relocation cases emphasize disruption, travel, and educational impact on child).

25. In determining a child’s best interests, courts consider, among other factors, the child’s age and developmental needs, the child’s stability, the effect of proposed arrangements on the child’s emotional, physical, and educational welfare, and each parent’s capacity to meet those needs. See Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243–44 (2000); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

26. Massachusetts courts have emphasized that continuity in schooling, preservation of a stable routine, and adequate rest are central components of a child’s best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–45 (importance of stability and predictability); Villiers v. Villiers, 448 Mass. 1007 (2007) (rescript) (affirming emphasis on child’s school and daily routine).

27. The Court has broad authority under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and M.G.L. c. 215, § 6 to tailor parenting-time provisions to protect the minor child’s welfare and to ensure that arrangements remain reasonable and workable in light of changed circumstances. See Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (affirming trial court’s discretion in structuring parenting time to serve child’s best interests).

28. Where, as here, a pre-existing schedule that was reasonable under prior circumstances has become detrimental to a child’s well-being due to later developments—specifically, a long-distance move by one parent, early-morning travel, and an observable negative impact on the child’s education—modification is warranted to align the order with the child’s best interests. See Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. at 511–13; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 899.

IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD  

29. Emily Johnson is an eight-year-old school-aged child whose academic, emotional, and physical development are significantly influenced by her sleep schedule, educational environment, and daily routines.

30. The current midweek Wednesday-overnight arrangement, given Father’s relocation to Cape Cod, imposes excessive and unnecessary travel on a school night and early school morning.

31. The repeated requirement that the child wake at approximately 4:30 A.M. on school days has caused chronic fatigue on Thursdays, contributing to reduced participation and diminished engagement in her education, as observed by her teacher.

32. The child’s fatigue and reduced functioning on Thursdays are directly and causally related to the current Wednesday-overnight parenting-time schedule and the ninety (90) mile commute each way between Father’s residence and the child’s school.

33. The child’s educational needs are not being adequately protected under the current schedule, in violation of the principle that custody and parenting-time arrangements must provide for the child’s physical, mental, moral, and educational well-being. See Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. at 618; Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 243–44.

34. The child’s best interests require that her school-day schedule allow for adequate sleep, reasonable commute times, and the ability to arrive at school rested and ready to learn.

35. It is in the child’s best interests that the Wednesday-overnight parenting time during the school year be eliminated or converted to a more developmentally appropriate, non-overnight midweek visit that does not require such early awakening or lengthy travel on school days.

36. The Mother is not seeking to terminate Father’s relationship with the child; she seeks only to adjust the schedule so that the child’s schooling, sleep, and overall welfare are adequately protected.

37. A reasonable adjustment of the weekend schedule, if necessary, can ensure that Father continues to have consistent and meaningful parenting time without imposing harmful travel and sleep disruption on school nights.

38. Modification of the current parenting-time provisions to eliminate the midweek overnight and to limit the child’s long-distance travel to non-school days will preserve the child’s relationship with Father while aligning the order with her best educational and developmental interests.

V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION  

39. Mother requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2019 Judgment, specifically:  

   a. Father’s relocation to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the child’s school;  
   b. The resulting change in the practical effect of the Wednesday-overnight schedule;  
   c. The requirement that the child wake at approximately 4:30 A.M. on Thursdays and undertake extensive travel on school days; and  
   d. The demonstrated adverse impact on the child’s school participation and overall well-being on Thursdays.

40. Mother further requests that the Court find that the current Wednesday-overnight schedule is no longer in the child’s best interests, and that modification is necessary to protect the child’s physical, emotional, and educational welfare.

41. Mother proposes that, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties or ordered by the Court, the parenting plan be modified as follows:

   a. The weekly Wednesday-overnight parenting time with Father during the school year shall be eliminated.  

   b. In the alternative, if the Court determines that some form of midweek contact is appropriate, Father may have a non-overnight midweek visit on Wednesdays during the school year, to occur locally (in the child’s town or nearby) and to end at a reasonable hour so that the child can return to Mother’s home for a normal bedtime, with no long-distance travel on a school night.

   c. Father’s regular parenting time every other weekend shall continue, with the exchanges occurring at times that avoid requiring the child to travel long distances late at night on school nights or in a manner that would compromise her sleep or school attendance.  

   d. To the extent needed to balance overall parenting time, the Court may grant Father modestly extended weekend time (for example, an earlier pickup on Fridays or a later drop-off on Sundays) so long as such extension does not interfere with the child’s sleep schedule or school obligations.

   e. During school vacations, holidays, and summer recess, the parties may follow a separate schedule, to be agreed upon by the parties or ordered by the Court, that permits additional overnights with Father when such overnights will not cause the child to endure extraordinary early-morning travel or interfere with her school attendance or educational functioning.

42. Mother further requests that all other provisions of the 2019 Judgment that are not inconsistent with the Court’s modification order remain in full force and effect.

43. Mother asks that the Court enter such additional and further orders as may be necessary and appropriate to clarify transportation responsibilities, pick-up and drop-off locations, and holiday/vacation scheduling, so as to minimize conflict and ensure predictability and stability for the child.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and conclude that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the August 15, 2019 Judgment, within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and, where applicable, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20) and relevant Massachusetts caselaw;

B. Find and conclude that the current Wednesday-overnight parenting-time arrangement, in light of Father’s relocation and the resulting travel and sleep disruption, is no longer in the minor child’s best interests;

C. Enter a Judgment of Modification eliminating Father’s weekly Wednesday overnight during the school year and, if the Court finds it appropriate, replacing it with a non-overnight midweek visit that does not require long-distance travel on a school night or an unreasonably early wake time;

D. Confirm or modestly adjust Father’s every-other-weekend parenting time so that the child’s long-distance travel occurs primarily on non-school days and does not compromise the child’s sleep, school attendance, or educational participation;

E. Order that all remaining terms of the August 15, 2019 Judgment not modified by this Court remain in full force and effect;

F. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to clarification of transportation, exchange locations, and holiday/vacation arrangements.

Respectfully submitted,
