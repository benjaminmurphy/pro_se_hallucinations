In the absence of such control in this case, we are not prepared to say that the common law should provide a remedy on the negligent encouragement theory advanced by the plaintiff....

Although the dissent assumes arguendo that certain security measures were negligent, it concludes that plaintiff failed to prove those acts or omissions proximately caused the injury, and would have granted directed verdicts for defendants. It therefore does not affirm or establish that defendants\u2019 failure to take reasonable steps was a breach of the standard of care to persons like the plaintiff, and in any event is not the majority holding.",
