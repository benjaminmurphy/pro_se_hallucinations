v.  

MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.

Docket No.: __________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), upon information and belief, is an individual formerly residing in the Cambridge area of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is now seeking to relocate to the State of New Hampshire for employment.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   - Emma Johnson, age 8 (“Emma” or “the minor child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 215, § 6, and G.L. c. 209C (to the extent applicable), as this Court entered the existing custody and parenting-time order on May 15, 2021.

5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the prior judgment and/or order regarding custody and parenting time was issued in this Court, and the minor child has resided within Middlesex County at all relevant times. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

6. On or about May 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2021 Custody Order”) governing legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the parties’ minor child.

7. Under the 2021 Custody Order, Mother has primary physical custody of Emma, and Father has parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend, on a schedule that presumes that the parties and the child live in close geographic proximity to one another and that the child attends a local Massachusetts school near Mother.

8. The 2021 Custody Order was reasonable at the time it was entered, based on the parties’ then‑existing living arrangements, commuting distances, and the child’s school placement and developmental needs.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the minor child and rendering the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions no longer in her best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 241–42 (2015); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226, 231–32 (2012).

10. Specifically, Father now intends to move from the Cambridge area of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, to the State of New Hampshire for a new job opportunity, significantly increasing the physical distance between his residence and the child’s primary residence and school.

11. Father seeks to maintain the existing parenting-time schedule—namely, mid‑week (Wednesday) overnights and alternating weekend parenting time—despite the relocation and the substantially increased travel time between the child’s primary residence/school and Father’s new residence.

12. The contemplated move to New Hampshire would require the minor child to commute approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in traffic for midweek overnights, followed by very early‑morning return trips to school the next day.

13. These long midweek drives, particularly on school nights, are unreasonable for an eight‑year‑old child and impose an undue burden on her rest, school attendance, school performance, and participation in extracurricular and after‑school activities. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710–12 (1985) (best‑interest analysis must focus in part on impact on child’s emotional, physical, and developmental needs); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–86 (2006).

14. Emma has already begun experiencing anxiety regarding these anticipated long drives and the prospect of missing or curtailing her after‑school activities in order to accommodate midweek travel to and from Father’s proposed New Hampshire residence.

15. The child’s anxiety about travel and disruption of routine, combined with the length of the commute and early mornings required for school, constitute a material change in circumstances affecting the child’s well‑being. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 264–66 (2001) (recognizing significance of child’s adjustment, stability, and routine in best‑interest analysis); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003).

16. The existing parenting schedule was crafted on the assumption that both parents and the child lived in or near Cambridge, allowing for short, manageable commutes and minimal disruption to the child’s school and daily routine.

17. Father’s relocation to New Hampshire fundamentally alters those underlying assumptions; the physical distance and travel time to maintain the existing Wednesday overnight are now substantially greater than when the 2021 Custody Order was entered.

18. When the factual predicates upon which a custody or parenting‑time order was based materially change, modification is appropriate where necessary to protect the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 547 (2010); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981).

19. Continued adherence to the existing Wednesday overnight arrangement, in light of Father’s relocation, would result in:

   a. Excessive time spent in a car on school nights;  
   b. Reduced sleep and increased fatigue for the child;  
   c. Interference with the child’s after‑school and extracurricular activities; and  
   d. Heightened anxiety and emotional distress for the child regarding travel and disrupted routine.

20. These consequences are contrary to Emma’s best interests and are not consistent with the “first and paramount duty” of the Court to ensure the welfare of the child. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843; *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 231–32.

21. Massachusetts law recognizes that a custody or parenting‑time order must be modified when a material and substantial change in circumstances occurs and modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuhmacher v. Shoesmith*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 706, 710–12 (2016); *Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. at 241–42; *Mansur v. Vinal*, 424 Mass. 155, 160–61 (1997).

22. The Father’s impending relocation and its direct impact on Emma’s day‑to‑day life and schooling constitute precisely the type of change in circumstances that warrants modification of the existing parenting plan. See *Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711–12; *Mason*, 447 Mass. at 184–86.

23. Mother does not seek to diminish the Father–child relationship or to eliminate Father’s meaningful parenting time. Rather, Mother seeks a reasonable adjustment of the schedule to account for the new distance between residences, to avoid unnecessary hardship to the child, and to preserve Father’s time with Emma in a way that is developmentally appropriate and logistically workable.

24. An adjusted schedule that eliminates the midweek overnight and focuses Father’s parenting time on weekends (and potentially extended blocks of time during school vacations and summers, as may be ordered by the Court) will reduce the child’s stress and travel burden while maintaining and fostering her relationship with Father. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402–04 (1981) (court must weigh stability and continuity for child against maintaining relationship with both parents).

25. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the changed circumstances created by Father’s relocation and is consistent with Massachusetts law’s emphasis on the child’s best interests, continuity, routine, and emotional and educational welfare. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44; *Rosenthal*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 264–66.

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF

26. General Laws c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Probate and Family Court, upon a complaint for modification, to “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the minor children” if the Court finds a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child and that modification is in the best interests of the child.

27. The Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court have consistently held that the moving party must show: (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior custody or parenting‑time order; and (b) that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:

   - *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226, 231–32 (2012);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003);  
   - *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 547 (2010);  
   - *Mansur v. Vinal*, 424 Mass. 155, 160–61 (1997);  
   - *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 241–42 (2015);  
   - *Schuhmacher v. Shoesmith*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 706, 710–12 (2016);  
   - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 264–66 (2001);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402–04 (1981).

28. The “best interests of the child” standard governs all determinations regarding custody and parenting time. See G.L. c. 208, § 31 (as to legal and physical custody); *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755, 766–67 (1983); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43.

29. Geographic relocation of a parent and the resulting impact on the child’s routine, schooling, and emotional well‑being may constitute a material change warranting modification of custody and/or parenting time. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710–12 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–86 (2006).

30. Here, the substantial increase in commuting distance and time, the disruption to the child’s school schedule and after‑school activities, and the development of anxiety in the minor child regarding long midweek travel collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the above‑cited authorities.

31. Maintaining the current midweek overnight arrangement in the face of these new conditions would adversely affect the child’s stability, rest, and emotional health, and is therefore inconsistent with her best interests, requiring this Court’s intervention and modification. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44; *Rosenthal*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 264–66; *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 231–32.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

32. Mother seeks a modification of the 2021 Custody Order to remove the midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time with Father, due to the increased travel distance and its impact on the child’s best interests.

33. Mother further seeks an adjustment of the weekend schedule to provide Father with reasonable and meaningful parenting time that accommodates the increased distance and the child’s school and activity schedule, such as:

   a. Continuing alternating weekend parenting time with Father, with appropriate pick‑up and drop‑off times that minimize missed school and activities; and/or  

   b. Reallocating some parenting time from midweek school days to longer blocks during weekends, school vacations, holidays, and/or summer periods, as the Court deems appropriate in light of the distance between the residences.

34. Mother also seeks such clarifying orders as the Court deems just regarding transportation responsibilities, pick‑up and drop‑off locations, and times, in order to reduce Emma’s travel‑related anxiety and to protect her school attendance, homework time, extracurricular involvement, and sleep.

35. The requested modification does not seek to interfere with Father’s relationship with Emma but seeks to place that relationship within a schedule that is safe, developmentally appropriate, and reasonably convenient given the new geographic realities.

36. The requested modification is in the best interests of the minor child and is necessary to safeguard her emotional, educational, and physical well‑being, as recognized under Massachusetts law governing custody and parenting‑time determinations. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44; *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 231–32; *Rosenthal*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 264–66.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and rule that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, specifically including Father’s relocation to New Hampshire, the significantly increased commuting distance, and the adverse impact on the minor child’s school schedule, extracurricular activities, rest, and emotional well‑being;

2. Find and rule that modification of the existing parenting‑time provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Emma Johnson;

3. Modify the 2021 Custody Order to eliminate Father’s midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time with the minor child;

4. Modify and/or clarify the weekend parenting‑time schedule so that Father’s parenting time is concentrated on alternating weekends and, as appropriate, during holidays, school vacations, and/or summer periods, in a manner that is reasonable given the distance between the parties’ residences and that protects the child’s stability, schooling, and activities;

5. Enter appropriate orders allocating responsibility for transportation, including pick‑up and drop‑off times and locations, so as to minimize the child’s travel burden and preserve her regular school and activity schedule;

6. Enter any additional or clarifying orders regarding legal custody, physical custody characterization, and parenting‑time provisions that the Court deems necessary and proper to serve the best interests of the minor child;

7. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
SARAH THOMPSON,  
pro se
