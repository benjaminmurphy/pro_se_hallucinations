Solomon. It does not analyze \u00a7 14, does not state that liability under \u00a7 14 is strict, and does not set out the statutory remedy of three months\u2019 rent or actual and consequential damages plus fees. Accordingly, it does not provide direct authority for the specific strict-liability damages rule described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Recovery by Wideman based on the contract rent does not result in an improper diversion to her of public funds. A private landlord, like Cruz Management, is not shielded from liability to which the landlord would otherwise be exposed merely because a part of its income is derived from Federal subsidy funds. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 110 n.13 (1982) (permitting recovery of treble damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, calculated on contract rent, where tenant\u2019s rent was subsidized)."

This excerpt is a concurring/dissenting opinion, not the majority, but it accurately reflects that the case reconsiders the old no\u2011warranty rule and adopts a modern, code\u2011based habitability framework with mutual interdependence of rent and habitability obligations, in tandem with G.L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A and related statutes. The passage thus provides at least analogous support for tenants\u2019 rights to habitable premises and remedies tied to serious interference with their tenancy, though it does not itself discuss \u201cstatutory damages\u201d expressly.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe second step required for the removal of the roadblock is the reversal of the present common law rule that the obligation of the tenant to pay rent and the obligation, if any, of the landlord to repair or maintain the rented premises are independent, and the substitution therefor of a new rule that such obligations are substantially mutually interdependent. The opinion of the court accomplishes this\u2026 tenants shall enjoy the rights which these various legal provisions have created for their benefit.\u201d"
