COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

PARTIES  

1.     Plaintiff Jessica Howard (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Howard”) is an individual residing at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Apartment ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 (the “Premises”).

2.     Defendant Thomas Green (“Defendant” or “Mr. Green”) is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or lessor of the residential property located at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 (the “Property”), which includes the Premises rented by Plaintiff.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3.     This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides tenants a cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4.     Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and § 21, the Cambridge District Court has jurisdiction over this matter because the amount in controversy does not exceed the statutory jurisdictional limit of the District Court and because this is an action in contract and under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5.     Venue is proper in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department under G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 223, § 8 because the Property and Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6.     On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises located at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138.

7.     Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises as her primary residence since on or about January 15, 2022.

8.     Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $2,500.00 to Defendant for the Premises.

9.     The tenancy between Plaintiff and Defendant is subject to, and incorporates by operation of law, the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the implied warranty of habitability recognized in Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

10.    Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment protecting the tenant from serious interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises caused by the landlord or those acting under his authority. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977).

11.    In or about early October 2025, Defendant began or caused to be begun substantial renovation and construction work in the apartment immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway.

12.    The renovation work has involved extensive drilling, hammering, power tools, and loud conversations and/or shouting by construction workers in close proximity to Plaintiff’s unit.

13.    This construction activity has occurred on weekdays, typically from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and has continued regularly and persistently for approximately two months as of the filing of this Complaint.

14.    Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the construction and renovation next to Plaintiff’s unit may continue for an additional one to two months, thereby prolonging the period of disturbance and interference.

15.    Plaintiff works from home and is present in the Premises during usual business hours, including the hours during which the construction noise and disruption occur.

16.    The volume and frequency of drilling, hammering, and other construction noise have made it extremely difficult for Plaintiff to perform her job duties, including but not limited to focusing on tasks, participating in calls, and maintaining a professional working environment.

17.    In addition to noise, dust and debris from the construction have regularly entered Plaintiff’s Premises through vents and other openings, causing discomfort, inconvenience, and concern about air quality and cleanliness.

18.    The dust infiltration has required Plaintiff to clean more frequently than she otherwise would, to adjust or restrict use of ventilation, and to endure reduced comfort and enjoyment of her home environment.

19.    Plaintiff has complained to Defendant about the severity and duration of the construction disturbance and the entry of dust into her unit.

20.    Defendant, acknowledging the disruption, offered Plaintiff only a small and limited rent reduction of approximately $100 off one month’s rent.

21.    The offered reduction does not reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the substantial and ongoing interference with her use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly given the months-long duration and impact on her ability to work.

22.    Defendant has continued, and continues, to authorize, permit, and/or fail to reasonably control the construction, the noise levels, and the dust infiltration such that the interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy has become substantial, ongoing, and unreasonable.

23.    Under Massachusetts law, a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when his actions or inactions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, even if the landlord is not acting with malice or ill will. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977) (landlord liable where he created circumstances resulting in constant noise from lounge interfering with tenants’ quiet enjoyment); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (interference must be “serious”).

24.    Massachusetts courts have held that excessive noise and disturbances originating from activities under the landlord’s control may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 715–18; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994) (serious interferences with tenancy may give rise to liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

25.    Here, Defendant, by arranging for, authorizing, or permitting extensive renovation to the directly adjacent unit, and by failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the severe and ongoing noise and dust infiltration, has created and maintained conditions that substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

26.    The disturbance and interference caused by the construction have been of sufficient intensity and duration that a reasonable tenant in Plaintiff’s position would find the conditions seriously disruptive to the use and enjoyment of the home for ordinary living purposes, including working from home.

27.    Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises for its intended residential purposes, including resting, concentrating, and conducting remote work during normal business hours, has been materially and adversely affected by the construction noise and dust.

28.    Plaintiff has not caused or contributed to the noise, dust, or other conditions complained of.

29.    The substantial interference complained of is directly attributable to Defendant’s actions and/or omissions, as the landlord and person in control of the Property and renovation activities.

30.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer actual damages, including but not limited to:  
       a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;  
       b. Loss of the beneficial use of the Premises as a suitable and reasonably quiet environment for work and daily living;  
       c. Emotional distress, frustration, and inconvenience arising from persistent noise and dust; and  
       d. Economic losses associated with interference with remote work and the value of the tenancy.

31.    Plaintiff reasonably estimates her actual damages to be at least Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees to the extent recoverable, based on the period of severe disruption already endured and anticipated ongoing interference.

32.    G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, all as may be applicable.

33.    Plaintiff reserves the right to seek the full relief allowed under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to actual and consequential damages and, if shown to be applicable, statutory minimum damages of three months’ rent. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982) (recognizing broad remedial purpose of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and allowing recovery for emotional distress and related harms); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

34.    Defendant’s conduct and resulting interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy occurred during the term of Plaintiff’s residential tenancy and in connection with Defendant’s ownership and control of the Property.

35.    Plaintiff has complied with all material terms of her tenancy and has fulfilled her obligations as a tenant, except to the extent that performance has been excused, diminished, or offset by Defendant’s breach.

36.    Defendant has refused or failed to take sufficient corrective or mitigating measures despite Plaintiff’s complaints and the continuing nature of the interference.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

37.    Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

38.    Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment protecting tenants from direct or indirect interference by the landlord with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

39.    Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord and the owner and/or lessor of the Property, owed Plaintiff a duty under G.L. c. 186, § 14 to refrain from actions or omissions that would directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

40.    Defendant, by authorizing, permitting, and/or failing reasonably to control or mitigate extensive and prolonged construction and renovation in the adjacent unit, caused or allowed serious and unreasonable noise, vibrations, and dust infiltration to affect Plaintiff’s Premises.

41.    The construction-related noise and dust were and are of such character, duration, and intensity as to substantially and unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including her ability to work from home and to enjoy ordinary residential life.

42.    Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may be held liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where his actions create conditions resulting in continuous or repeated interference with tenants’ premises, including excessive noise or disturbances emanating from another part of the property under the landlord’s control. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977); see also Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

43.    The interference Plaintiff has experienced is “serious” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (quiet enjoyment claim requires “substantial interference” with tenancy); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982) (recognizing emotional and psychological harms as cognizable damages).

44.    Defendant’s conduct constitutes a direct and/or indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

45.    Defendant’s interference was not trivial, fleeting, or de minimis; instead, it has persisted on a near-daily basis during ordinary business hours over a period of months and is expected to continue, thereby depriving Plaintiff of the normal, reasonable use of her home.

46.    Defendant’s offer of a minimal, one-time rent reduction of about $100 was inadequate to cure or compensate for the serious, extended interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

47.    As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, emotional distress, annoyance, inconvenience, and economic impacts related to her ability to work from home.

48.    Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, as applicable. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–89 (1994).

49.    Plaintiff has been damaged in at least the amount of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, costs, and any attorneys’ fees recoverable under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

50.    To the extent necessary, Plaintiff invokes the remedial protections of G.L. c. 93A, §§ 2 and 9 only insofar as they inform the interpretation and enforcement of landlords’ duties to tenants under Massachusetts law, including recognition that unfair or deceptive practices in the landlord–tenant context are disfavored. See 940 C.M.R. 3.17; see also Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–89 (1994). (Plaintiff does not assert a separate cause of action under G.L. c. 93A in this Complaint.)

51.    Plaintiff further relies on Massachusetts case law recognizing the strong public policy in favor of protecting residential tenants’ rights to habitable and reasonably peaceful housing. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Howard respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Green as follows:

A.    On Count I, a finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B.    An award of actual and consequential damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00);

C.    To the extent applicable under G.L. c. 186, § 14, an award of not less than three months’ rent as statutory damages, in lieu of or in addition to actual damages, as permitted by law;

D.    An award of costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel and to the extent recoverable under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

E.    Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, including under G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

F.    Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper to compensate Plaintiff for Defendant’s breach and to protect Plaintiff’s rights to quiet enjoyment going forward.

JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

DATED: December 1, 2025  

Respectfully submitted,
