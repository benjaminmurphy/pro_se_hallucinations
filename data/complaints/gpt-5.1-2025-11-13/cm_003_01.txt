v.  

MICHAEL CARTER,  
  Defendant.

Docket No.: ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Carter (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, Michael Carter (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Jacob Carter (date of birth omitted for privacy; age 8).

2. The Defendant, Michael Carter, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Jacob Carter.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6, and G.L. c. 208 and/or c. 209C (as applicable), and continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 28A, and under the Massachusetts enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209B.

4. Venue in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court is proper because the prior custody judgment or order at issue was entered in this Court, the child resides primarily within Middlesex County, and the child has resided in Massachusetts for more than six months preceding this Complaint. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; G.L. c. 209B, § 2.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

5. On or about May 10, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment or Order (the “Existing Order”) providing for shared legal custody of the minor child, Jacob Carter, with primary physical custody to Mother, and parenting time to Father on designated weekends and such other times as specified therein.

6. At the time of entry of the Existing Order, the Court found, either expressly or implicitly, that both parties were stable, able to co‑parent, and able to provide a safe and appropriate environment for the minor child, and that the parenting schedule then ordered was in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31.

7. The Existing Order remains in full force and effect and has not previously been modified or superseded by any subsequent judgment or order of this Court, except as may be set forth in temporary or ancillary orders not pertinent to this Complaint.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the Existing Order on May 10, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the safety, welfare, and best interests of the minor child, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law, including but not limited to *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. 20 (1981); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

9. Specifically, Mother has recently become aware of issues involving Father’s apparent use of alcohol or other intoxicating substances during his parenting time with the child, and of the child’s exposure to such impairment, all of which were unknown to the Court and to Mother at the time of the Existing Order.

10. On multiple recent occasions, the minor child Jacob has reported to Mother that there are “special drinks” at Father’s residence and that Father sometimes “can’t walk straight” when Jacob is there.

11. The child’s statements are consistent and spontaneous, and they are of a nature that reasonably lead Mother to believe that Father may be consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substances to the point of impairment while responsible for the care of the minor child.

12. A neighbor who is familiar with the parties and aware of the existing parenting schedule recently observed Father returning with the child late at night and recorded a video in which Father appears to be stumbling while getting Jacob out of the car.

13. The neighbor provided Mother with this video. On information and belief, the video accurately depicts Father’s apparent physical instability and impaired coordination while he was responsible for Jacob’s immediate care and safety.

14. Mother is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Father’s apparent impairment occurred during a time when he was operating a motor vehicle with Jacob as a passenger and/or immediately after operating a motor vehicle, thereby placing the child at serious risk of harm.

15. The school that Jacob attends has recently reported to Mother that Jacob routinely appears exhausted on Monday mornings, following weekends spent in Father’s care, which was not the case at or near the time of the Existing Order.

16. Mother is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Jacob’s exhaustion on Mondays is consistent with Father’s failure to provide a safe, stable, and structured environment during his weekend parenting time, including adequate bedtime, supervision, and routine.

17. The pattern of (a) the child’s reports of “special drinks” and Father “not walking straight,” (b) the neighbor’s video showing Father stumbling while retrieving Jacob from a vehicle late at night, and (c) the school’s consistent observations of Jacob being exhausted on Mondays, collectively establish a material change in circumstances materially different from those presumed by the Court when the Existing Order was entered.

18. At the time of the Existing Order, neither the Court nor Mother had reason to believe that Father consumed intoxicating substances to the point of impairment while responsible for the minor child, nor that the child’s welfare during weekend overnights would be compromised by such conduct.

19. The current circumstances present safety concerns for the minor child, including but not limited to: potential impaired driving; inadequate supervision; possible neglect of the child’s basic needs such as sleep and routine; and emotional distress from observing a parent in an impaired state.

20. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a child’s safety and well‑being are paramount in custody determinations and that the Court may modify custody or parenting time upon a showing of a material change of circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); *Custody of a Minor (No. 1)*, 377 Mass. 876 (1979); *Custody of a Minor (No. 2)*, 392 Mass. 719 (1984); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Loebel v. Loebel*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 740 (2010).

21. The above‑described developments constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since May 10, 2021, warranting modification of the Existing Order to ensure that the child is not exposed to unsafe conditions or a caregiver who is or may be impaired while exercising parenting time.

22. Mother does not seek to interfere with Father’s relationship with Jacob but seeks reasonable safeguards to protect the child and ensure that Father’s parenting time is exercised in a safe, sober, and appropriate manner consistent with the child’s best interests. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (best interests standard); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must determine custody and parenting time based on the “best interests of the child,” considering, among other factors, the child’s welfare, safety, stability, and the parents’ ability to provide for the child’s needs.

24. Defendant’s apparent consumption of alcohol or other substances to the point of impairment during his parenting time, and the associated risks described above, call into serious question his current ability to provide a safe and stable environment for overnight care of the minor child.

25. Massachusetts case law makes clear that where a parent’s conduct poses a potential danger to a child’s physical or emotional well‑being, the Court may impose restrictions on that parent’s custody or parenting time, including supervised visitation or conditions related to substance use. See, e.g., *Adoption of a Minor*, 383 Mass. 573 (1981); *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).

26. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific risk—Father’s apparent impairment and the child’s exposure to it—while preserving Father’s opportunity to maintain and, if possible, improve a healthy relationship with the child under conditions that ensure Jacob’s safety.

27. Given the child’s young age (8), his reliance on caregivers for transportation, supervision, and emotional stability, and the indications of Father’s impairment and its impact on Jacob (including school reports of exhaustion), the best interests of the child require that Father’s overnights be suspended or subject to supervision and/or specific safety conditions until such time as Father can demonstrate that he is consistently sober and able to provide safe care.

28. In determining the best interests of the child, the Court may consider evidence of a parent’s pattern of behavior, including substance use, and may modify the allocation of legal or physical custody, and the nature and conditions of parenting time, where necessary to protect the child. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, 31; *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. at 370–72; *Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. at 26–27; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. at 190–92.

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

29. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties and that the modification is in the best interests of the child.

30. The material changes alleged herein involve new and ongoing safety concerns, specifically Father’s apparent impairment and the resulting risk to the minor child during Father’s parenting time, which were not contemplated by the Court at the time of the Existing Order.

31. Under *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981), and *Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. 20 (1981), a modification is warranted when changes in circumstances make the existing judgment no longer consistent with the best interests of the child.

32. In *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), the Supreme Judicial Court reaffirmed that custody and parenting arrangements may and should be modified when conditions that affect the child’s welfare have changed in a way that impacts the child’s best interests.

33. In light of the evidence of Father’s apparent impairment and the child’s resulting fatigue and potential exposure to unsafe conditions, the Existing Order allowing unsupervised overnight parenting time with Father is no longer consistent with Jacob’s best interests and should be modified.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

34. Mother seeks a modification of the Existing Order to protect the best interests and safety of the minor child, Jacob, while preserving Father’s opportunity for an ongoing relationship under appropriate safeguards.

35. Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order on May 10, 2021, specifically with respect to Father’s apparent impairment from alcohol or other substances during his parenting time, and the resulting safety risks to the child.

   b. Modify the Existing Order to suspend Father’s unsupervised overnight parenting time with Jacob until further order of the Court.

   c. Order that, until further order of the Court, Father’s parenting time with the minor child be limited to supervised parenting time at a supervised visitation center or in another supervised setting approved by the Court, at times and for durations the Court deems appropriate.

   d. In the alternative, should the Court determine that immediate, formal supervision is not necessary, impose conditions on Father’s parenting time, including but not limited to:

      i. A prohibition on Father’s use of alcohol or non‑prescribed intoxicating substances for at least twenty‑four (24) hours before and during all parenting time;

      ii. A requirement that Father not operate a motor vehicle with the child as a passenger if Father has consumed any alcohol or intoxicating substance within the preceding twenty‑four (24) hours;

      iii. A requirement that Father comply with random alcohol and/or drug screening as the Court deems appropriate, with results available to the Court and, if ordered, to Mother;

      iv. A requirement that Father participate in and, if appropriate, successfully complete a substance abuse evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment;

      v. A requirement that Father maintain regular, age‑appropriate bedtime and routines for Jacob, and cooperate with school attendance and performance, including ensuring that Jacob is adequately rested for school.

   e. Grant to Mother sole physical custody during the pendency of these concerns, with legal custody either remaining shared or being modified to sole legal custody to Mother, as the Court deems necessary to protect the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

   f. Issue any temporary orders necessary under G.L. c. 208, § 28A to protect the minor child during the pendency of this Complaint, including temporary suspension of overnight parenting time and imposition of substance‑related conditions and/or supervision.

   g. Order that, prior to any restoration of unsupervised overnights, Father demonstrate to the Court that he is able to care for the child safely, including compliance with any evaluation, treatment, or testing ordered by the Court, and a reasonable period of compliance with conditions.

   h. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Accept jurisdiction over this Complaint for Modification;

2. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the Existing Order dated May 10, 2021;

3. Find that modification of the Existing Order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Jacob Carter;

4. Modify the Existing Order to suspend Father’s unsupervised overnight parenting time and to order supervised parenting time or, in the alternative, impose strict conditions on Father’s parenting time to ensure the safety and welfare of the child, as set forth above;

5. Modify physical and, if necessary, legal custody consistent with the child’s best interests;

6. Enter appropriate temporary orders to protect the child pending final hearing on this Complaint;
