PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT

Docket No. ____________  

JESSICA TURNER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
---------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The minor child who is the subject of this action is:

   - Ethan Johnson, date of birth: [withheld for privacy], age 8 (the “Child”).

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 3, in that this is a Complaint for Modification of an existing custody and parenting time order involving a minor child under the jurisdiction of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court.

5. Venue in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court is proper because the original judgment and custody orders were entered in this Court, and the parties and the Child reside within its territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 209C, § 6.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

6. On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2018 Order”) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the Child.

7. Under the 2018 Order, Mother was granted primary physical custody of the Child, and Father was granted parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.

8. The 2018 Order expressly or effectively limited Father’s parenting time to non‑overnight visits because, at that time, Father only had a room in a shared apartment with roommates and no separate or appropriate sleeping space for a young child.

9. The 2018 Order was entered when the Child was approximately three years old, was not yet in full‑time school, and had developmental, logistical, and housing‑related needs that informed the Court’s then‑appropriate limitation on overnights.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2018 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Child’s welfare and the appropriateness of the existing parenting schedule, such that modification is now warranted and in the Child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Pearson v. Board of Health of Chicopee*, 402 Mass. 797 (1988); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

11. The Child is now eight (8) years old and in full‑time elementary school, with regular homework, school routines, and age‑appropriate social and developmental needs that differ substantially from those of a three‑year‑old.

12. Father’s housing circumstances have materially and substantially improved since 2018. Father now maintains his own independent apartment, not a shared room with roommates, and the Child has his own bedroom and appropriate sleeping arrangements at Father’s residence.

13. The original reason for denying Father overnight parenting time—the lack of appropriate, independent housing and a separate sleeping space for the Child—no longer exists.

14. The Child has a strong, positive relationship with Father and, as he has grown older, has repeatedly expressed a desire to spend longer periods of time and have sleepovers at Father’s home. While the Child’s wishes are not controlling, they are entitled to some weight consistent with his age and maturity. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711–12 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 268 (2001).

15. Under the current schedule of three short weekday visits plus a Sunday afternoon—with no overnights—the Child is shuttled back and forth frequently on school nights, which is disruptive to his homework, bedtime routine, and overall stability.

16. The present schedule requires multiple transitions per week during the school week, which has become exhausting for the Child and burdensome for both parents, and is no longer well‑suited to an eight‑year‑old in full‑time school.

17. A more typical, developmentally appropriate schedule for an eight‑year‑old includes longer blocks of time and regular overnights with the non‑primary parent where feasible, to foster continuity, stability, and a meaningful parent‑child relationship, provided it is in the Child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006).

18. Mother and Father **both agree** that the existing parenting schedule is outdated, no longer fits the Child’s age and school life, and should be changed to include appropriate overnights and fewer, more consolidated transitions, while preserving Mother’s status as the primary physical custodian.

19. The parents’ agreement that modification is appropriate, while not binding on the Court, is further evidence that the parties themselves recognize the substantial change in circumstances and the benefits to the Child of a revised schedule. See *Cooper v. Cooper*, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 725–26 (2021) (courts consider parents’ agreements but must still evaluate best interests).

20. The combination of (a) the Child’s increased age and school enrollment, (b) Father’s substantial improvement in housing and ability to provide a safe, appropriate environment including a separate bedroom, (c) the Child’s expressed desire for overnights with Father, and (d) the practical problems caused by the current multiple short weekday visits, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Child’s welfare since entry of the 2018 Order.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

21. Under Massachusetts law, any order regarding custody or parenting time must serve the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409–10 (1976); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003).

22. In determining the Child’s best interests, the Court may consider, among other factors: the Child’s age and needs; the Child’s relationship with each parent; the capacity of each parent to provide for the Child’s needs; the pattern of care; the Child’s adjustment to home, school, and community; and the stability of the proposed arrangements. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981).

23. The Child has a stable primary home with Mother and is well‑adjusted to his school and community. Maintaining Mother as the primary physical custodian, while expanding and restructuring Father’s parenting time, will preserve this stability while appropriately strengthening the Child’s relationship with Father.

24. Father now has the demonstrated ability to provide safe, appropriate overnight care for the Child in a suitable residence, including a separate bedroom and routine structure, which directly addresses past concerns that led to the prohibition on overnights. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996) (courts consider living conditions and ability to provide care).

25. A modified parenting plan that provides Father with regular, predictable overnight parenting time—particularly on weekends and/or non‑school nights—will:

   a. Reduce the number of transitions and car trips on school nights;  
   b. Improve the Child’s ability to complete homework and maintain consistent bedtime routines;  
   c. Allow for more natural, extended parent‑child time and activities; and  
   d. Promote the Child’s emotional well‑being and sense of security with both parents.

26. Both parents’ willingness to cooperate in restructuring the schedule supports a finding that a modified plan can be implemented consistent with the Child’s best interests, without exposing the Child to unnecessary conflict. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 845–46 (importance of parents’ ability to cooperate); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85.

27. There is no known safety, abuse, neglect, or substance‑abuse concern that would make increased or overnight parenting time with Father contrary to the Child’s best interests under G.L. c. 208, §§ 31A, 31B or under G.L. c. 209A.

28. A revised parenting plan will be more developmentally appropriate, less disruptive academically, and better aligned with the Child’s expressed wishes, all of which are consistent with the Child’s best interests under Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610, 619–20 (1986); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

29. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, this Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the minor children” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See also *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. at 370; *Bercume v. Bercume*, 428 Mass. 635, 642–43 (1999).

30. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Order solely as to physical custody terms and parenting time / visitation, leaving legal custody and child support (if any) unchanged unless otherwise required by law.

31. Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Confirm that Mother shall remain the primary physical custodian of the Child, with both parents continuing to share legal custody if so provided in the existing Judgment;  
   b. Grant Father expanded, regular overnight parenting time with the Child, to be structured so as to reduce the number of short school‑night transitions and better accommodate the Child’s school schedule;  
   c. Establish a specific, detailed parenting schedule that includes:

      i. At least one (and potentially two) overnight periods on non‑school nights most weeks (for example, alternating weekends from Friday after school through Sunday evening or Monday morning, and/or one mid‑week overnight, as the Court deems appropriate);  
      ii. A regular holiday and school‑vacation parenting schedule allocating major holidays, school breaks, and special days (such as birthdays) between the parents in a fair and predictable manner; and  
      iii. Provisions for transportation responsibilities and exchange times and locations that minimize disruption to the Child’s school and bedtime routines.

32. Mother further requests that the modified judgment acknowledge that the prior restriction on overnights was based on Father’s then‑housing situation and the Child’s age, that those conditions have materially changed, and that overnight parenting time with Father is now appropriate and in the Child’s best interests.

33. To the extent necessary, Mother also requests that the Court make such ancillary orders as may be required to implement the modified parenting schedule, including, if applicable under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 28A, any corresponding adjustment to support that the Court finds appropriate based on the revised parenting time, the parties’ incomes, and the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines (without altering Mother’s primary physical custody status).

34. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the substantial, material changes since 2018 and to promote the Child’s best interests, while preserving the stability and continuity of the Child’s primary home life.

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2018 custody and parenting‑time order, including, without limitation, the Child’s age and school status, Father’s substantial improvement in housing, and the practical and developmental issues created by the current multiple short weekday visits with no overnights;

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions is necessary and in the best interests of the Child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and applicable case law;

C. Enter a Modified Judgment and Order:

   1. Confirming Mother as the primary physical custodian of the Child (and continuing existing legal custody arrangements unless otherwise ordered);  
   2. Granting Father regular, specified overnight parenting time with the Child and reducing the number of short weekday transitions;  
   3. Establishing a clear, written parenting schedule for weekdays, weekends, holidays, school vacations, and summers that is age‑ and school‑appropriate for the Child; and  
   4. Allocating transportation and exchange responsibilities in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Child’s school and bedtime routines;

D. Make any additional orders concerning implementation of the modified parenting schedule, and, if necessary, address any related matters (including, if properly before the Court, any child‑support adjustments) consistent with Massachusetts law and the Child’s best interests; and

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
