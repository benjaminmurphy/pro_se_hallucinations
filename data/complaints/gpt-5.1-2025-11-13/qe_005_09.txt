                     COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT  
                        OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Lawson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

                           I.   PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 12 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

2. Defendant Mark Lawson is, on information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental property located at 12 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144, including Plaintiff’s apartment (the “Premises”) and the third‑floor apartment located directly above Plaintiff’s apartment.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted as Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186.

                           II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law, including the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, is approximately $5,000.

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and the applicable jurisdictional statutes governing the District Court Department, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy falls within the jurisdictional limits of the Somerville District Court.

7. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court under G.L. c. 223 because the real property that is the subject of this dispute is located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Somerville.

                           III.   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendant for the rental of the second‑floor apartment located at 12 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, MA 02144 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

9. Under the Lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendant monthly rent in the amount of $1,800.

10. Plaintiff has, at all relevant times, paid or attempted to pay rent as required by the Lease and has otherwise complied with all material terms and obligations under the Lease.

11. The Lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.

12. Independent of the Lease language, Massachusetts law implies and/or imposes a covenant of quiet enjoyment in all residential tenancies. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 95–101 (1982); Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929).

13. Approximately six months before the filing of this Complaint, new tenants moved into the third‑floor apartment located directly above Plaintiff’s Apartment at 12 Elm Street (the “Upstairs Tenants”).

14. Immediately following the Upstairs Tenants’ arrival, Plaintiff began experiencing persistent and excessive noise emanating from their apartment, including but not limited to:

    a. Loud stomping and heavy footfalls at all hours of the day and night;

    b. Music played at high volume late at night;

    c. Repeated sounds of furniture being dragged, dropped, or moved around, often around midnight or the early‑morning hours.

15. The noise described above has been frequent, substantial, and recurring, and has continued over a period of months.

16. The noise regularly continues into late evening and nighttime hours, depriving Plaintiff of normal sleep and rest.

17. Plaintiff has averaged only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night as a result of the persistent noise intrusions.

18. The noise is plainly audible and disruptive within the Apartment and is sufficiently loud and frequent that it substantially interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

19. Plaintiff initially attempted to resolve the issue informally and reasonably by speaking directly with the Upstairs Tenants and requesting that they lower the noise, particularly during late-night hours.

20. Following Plaintiff’s first direct request, the Upstairs Tenants temporarily reduced their noise for approximately one week.

21. After approximately one week, the Upstairs Tenants resumed their prior pattern of loud and disruptive noise, including late‑night stomping, music, and furniture movement.

22. Over the ensuing months, Plaintiff made multiple complaints to Defendant regarding the excessive noise, specifically about:

    a. The Upstairs Tenants’ late‑night and early‑morning stomping and loud walking;

    b. The playing of loud music at night;

    c. The frequent movement or dropping of furniture around or after midnight.

23. Plaintiff complained to Defendant regarding the noise on at least five or six separate occasions.

24. On information and belief, Defendant owns, controls, and/or manages both Plaintiff’s Apartment and the Upstairs Tenants’ apartment, and therefore has the authority and ability to investigate and correct conditions that substantially interfere with one tenant’s quiet enjoyment as caused by another tenant.

25. In response to Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant spoke with the Upstairs Tenants only once.

26. After that single conversation, Defendant told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live,” or words to that effect, and declined to take further meaningful steps to resolve the ongoing noise problem.

27. Defendant failed to:

    a. Establish or enforce reasonable rules or house policies about noise and quiet hours;

    b. Conduct any sustained investigation into the noise complaints;

    c. Provide any effective warning, notice, or enforcement measures to the Upstairs Tenants;

    d. Take reasonable measures within his control as a landlord to abate a continuing, known interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

28. The excessive noise and Defendant’s failure to act have continued for months and are ongoing.

29. As a direct result of the persistent noise and Defendant’s failure to remedy it, Plaintiff’s health, employment, and daily life have been adversely affected.

30. Plaintiff has experienced significant sleep deprivation, stress, anxiety, and emotional distress.

31. Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk, an incident which directly resulted from her chronic lack of sleep caused by the noise in the Apartment.

32. Plaintiff has sought medical treatment for sleep disturbance attributable to the excessive noise and attendant stress.

33. Plaintiff’s physician has prescribed sleep medication to address Plaintiff’s inability to obtain adequate rest in the Apartment.

34. Plaintiff currently pays approximately $40 per month for sleep medication prescribed to mitigate the effects of the ongoing noise disturbance.

35. In an effort to cope with the noise and preserve some measure of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has also incurred out‑of‑pocket expenses for items including, but not limited to, earplugs and a white noise machine, and has undertaken measures such as rearranging the bedroom layout, none of which have successfully abated the disturbance.

36. Despite these efforts, the severity and persistence of the noise continue to deprive Plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of her home that a reasonable tenant would expect.

37. The interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy is substantial, serious, and ongoing, and is not merely a minor annoyance or inconvenience.

38. Defendant has been on repeated, actual notice of the nature, severity, and persistence of the noise problem and its impact on Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home.

39. Defendant has the legal right and practical ability to take reasonable steps as landlord to investigate and correct tenant behavior that unreasonably interferes with other tenants’ quiet enjoyment, including the ability to issue written warnings, enforce lease obligations, adjust or adopt house rules, or, if necessary, pursue eviction or non‑renewal.

40. Notwithstanding his notice of the problem and his ability to act, Defendant has unreasonably refused and/or failed to take adequate and timely action to remedy the situation.

41. Defendant’s inaction in the face of repeated complaints and obvious interference constitutes at least a negligent failure, and, given the duration and impact of the problem, rises to the level of at least reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered:

    a. Loss of sleep and associated health impacts;

    b. Emotional distress, including stress, frustration, and anxiety;

    c. Out‑of‑pocket medical and medication costs, including at least $40 per month in sleep‑medication expenses;

    d. Costs for mitigating devices (earplugs, white noise machine);

    e. Employment‑related consequences, including a written warning resulting from noise‑induced sleep deprivation;

    f. Loss of the full value of the rental premises and the benefit of the bargain under the Lease.

43. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her actual and consequential damages arising from Defendant’s breach of quiet enjoyment, exclusive of statutory multiples, at approximately $5,000.

44. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–75 (1994); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 760–61 (1979).

                      IV.   CAUSE OF ACTION  
       BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
         (G.L. c. 186, § 14; COMMON LAW; STATUTORY)

45. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 44 as if fully set forth herein.

46. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and shall also be liable for costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

47. Massachusetts law has long recognized both a common‑law and statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects tenants from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of leased premises by the landlord or by others acting with the landlord’s knowledge and acquiescence. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 95–101 (1982); Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929).

48. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when the landlord, or others whose conduct the landlord has the power to control, substantially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises, or when the landlord, having knowledge of a serious interference, fails to take reasonable steps to cure it. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 396 Mass. 273, 278–80 (1985).

49. In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to prevent excessive noise from a lounge operated on the premises, where the landlord created or permitted conditions that foreseeably resulted in serious disturbance to tenants.

50. In Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 396 Mass. 273 (1985), the Court held that a landlord could be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where it failed to take reasonable steps to protect a tenant from serious interference and harm caused by other tenants or third parties when the landlord had both notice and the ability to act.

51. The covenant of quiet enjoyment, as applied in Massachusetts, protects residential tenants from substantial, persistent disturbances, including noise and conditions that significantly interfere with the ordinary use of the home and the tenant’s health and safety. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 784–86 (1994).

52. Massachusetts courts have recognized that a landlord’s failure to cure serious, ongoing disturbances caused by other tenants can give rise to liability for breach of quiet enjoyment, particularly where the landlord is on notice of the problem and has the authority to act. See Doe, 396 Mass. at 278–80; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–75 (1994).

53. Plaintiff’s Lease expressly provides for “quiet enjoyment,” reinforcing the statutory and common‑law protections recognized in G.L. c. 186, § 14 and long‑standing case law.

54. Defendant is a “landlord” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and is bound by both the statutory and common‑law covenants of quiet enjoyment.

55. The persistent, excessive noise from the Upstairs Tenants—stomping, loud music late at night, and frequent furniture movement around midnight and beyond—constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

56. The interference is significant, recurring, and has continued over a substantial period of time, resulting in chronic sleep deprivation, health impacts, employment consequences, and emotional distress.

57. Defendant had actual knowledge of the serious and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy through Plaintiff’s five to six complaints and his own communication with the Upstairs Tenants.

58. Defendant had the legal authority and practical ability to take reasonable steps to address and correct the Upstairs Tenants’ conduct, including but not limited to establishing or enforcing quiet‑hours rules, issuing formal notices, adjusting lease terms, or taking appropriate tenancy‑enforcement measures.

59. Defendant unreasonably failed and refused to take adequate remedial action after becoming aware of the problem, instead responding that he “can’t control how people live,” and taking no sustained steps to abate the disturbance.

60. Defendant’s failure to act in the face of known and ongoing substantial interference constituted, at minimum, negligence in the performance of his duties as landlord and, in view of the length and seriousness of the disturbance, constituted reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

61. Defendant’s conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused Plaintiff to lose the quiet enjoyment of the Premises guaranteed by the Lease and by Massachusetts law.

62. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment entitles Plaintiff to actual and consequential damages. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Darmetko, 378 Mass. at 760–61; Simon, 385 Mass. at 101–02.

63. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover, at a minimum, three months’ rent or her actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater. At a monthly rent of $1,800, three months’ rent totals $5,400.

64. Plaintiff’s reasonably estimated actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of sleep, emotional distress associated with the noise and loss of home enjoyment, out‑of‑pocket medical and medication costs, costs of mitigation efforts (earplugs, white noise machine), and employment‑related harm, are at least $5,000.

65. Accordingly, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to statutory damages of not less than $5,400 (three months’ rent), because that amount is greater than Plaintiff’s estimated actual and consequential damages.

66. Plaintiff is also entitled to reasonable costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, even though she is currently self‑represented. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 775 (1994) (discussing mandatory nature of fee‑shifting); Bourne v. Austin, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 743–44 (1985).

67. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment also constitutes a violation of the implied warranty of habitability and of Massachusetts public policy protecting tenants’ right to a safe and livable home, which further informs the scope and seriousness of the breach. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977).

68. To the extent necessary, Plaintiff invokes the protections of G.L. c. 239, § 8A as background public policy recognizing tenants’ rights to assert landlord violations of law, including breaches of quiet enjoyment, in actions relating to their tenancy.

69. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer harm and damages as described above, and is entitled to statutory and actual relief.

                            V.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Lawson, and grant the following relief:

   5. Compensation for employment‑related harm proximately caused by the interference, including the consequences of the written warning received due to noise‑induced sleep deprivation;

D. An order that Defendant take reasonable steps, within his power as landlord, to abate the ongoing noise‑related interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to enforcing reasonable quiet‑hours rules and other appropriate tenancy‑management measures;
