THOMAS REED,  
Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Jessica Li (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows against Defendant Thomas Reed (“Defendant”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Li is an individual who resides at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Springfield, Massachusetts 011__.

2. Defendant Thomas Reed is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or lessor of the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 011__ (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises out of a residential tenancy located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Springfield District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21 and G.L. c. 223, § 2, because the Premises are located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction and the causes of action arose here.

6. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Apartment as her home since on or about January 15, 2022, and has at all relevant times been a tenant in good standing, paying rent as required or otherwise in compliance with her obligations.

10. The Apartment includes two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, and other rooms typical of a residential apartment.

11. Plaintiff used one of the two bedrooms (the “Office Bedroom”) as a home office for her work.

12. Approximately six weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint, the electrical service to the Office Bedroom failed. The electrical outlets in that room ceased to function, and the overhead light fixture likewise stopped working.

13. The loss of electricity is limited to the Office Bedroom; other portions of the Apartment remain powered. The condition appears to be caused by defective or deteriorated wiring serving that room.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical failure in the Office Bedroom and requested that it be repaired so she could continue to use the room safely and normally.

15. Defendant sent an electrician to inspect the Office Bedroom. The electrician informed Plaintiff and/or Defendant that the problem required a more extensive repair due to the building’s old wiring and could not be resolved with a minor or temporary fix.

16. Despite this information, Defendant has failed and refused, for approximately six weeks, to complete the necessary repairs to restore electrical power to the Office Bedroom.

17. Defendant has told Plaintiff that he is “getting quotes” and that the repair is “complicated” because of the age and condition of the building’s wiring, but he has not arranged or caused the work to be done within a reasonable time.

18. As a result, the Office Bedroom has had no working electricity in the outlets or the overhead light for approximately six weeks.

19. Because there is no electricity in the Office Bedroom, Plaintiff cannot reasonably use that room for her intended and normal purpose as a home office.

20. The lack of electricity renders the Office Bedroom effectively uninhabitable and unusable, as Plaintiff cannot safely operate lights, computer equipment, or other necessary devices in that room.

21. Plaintiff’s inability to use the Office Bedroom has substantially interfered with her quiet enjoyment and use of the Apartment as a whole, causing the remaining space to become cramped and disorderly, with office equipment and materials moved into the living room.

22. To continue performing her work, Plaintiff has been forced to work from coffee shops, where she must make daily purchases to remain on the premises.

23. Plaintiff estimates that she has been spending approximately $15 per day on coffee and food at coffee shops to have a place to sit and work, over an extended period of several weeks.

24. In addition, Plaintiff has paid for a coworking space membership in the approximate amount of $150 per month during the period in which the Office Bedroom has been unusable, solely to obtain functional working space that she would otherwise have had within the Premises.

25. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home have been substantially diminished by the loss of the Office Bedroom and the resulting overcrowding and disarray in the remainder of the Apartment.

26. Defendant’s failure, over a period of approximately six weeks, to remedy a serious and material electrical defect that he knows about, and which was confirmed by an electrician, is unreasonable and constitutes at least negligent, and in the circumstances reckless or willful, disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.

27. The condition of the electrical wiring in the Office Bedroom, and the resulting absence of electricity there, constitutes a serious interference with the livability and habitability of the Premises, in violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.351, 410.352, and 410.750 (requiring safe and adequate electrical service in residential dwellings).

28. Defendant’s failure to correct this defect within a reasonable period after notice amounts to a constructive eviction from the Office Bedroom and a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

29. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to out‑of‑pocket costs for coffee shops and coworking space, loss of use of a significant portion of the Premises, reduction in rental value of the Apartment, stress, inconvenience, and loss of quiet enjoyment.

30. Plaintiff estimates her damages at not less than Four Hundred Fifty Dollars ($450.00) as of the date of filing, and reserves the right to amend this amount as additional damages accrue or are substantiated.

31. At all times relevant, Defendant owed Plaintiff the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, which applies to all written or oral tenancies in Massachusetts.

32. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as described above, constitute a violation of that covenant of quiet enjoyment.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

33. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully set forth herein.

34. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that any landlord who does so “shall… be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

35. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is read into every residential tenancy in Massachusetts, whether or not expressly stated in the lease. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 96–101 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 281–82 (1994).

36. A landlord’s negligent or intentional failure to correct serious defects in an apartment, especially those affecting habitability and use, after notice, constitutes an unlawful interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997).

37. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to freedom from serious and substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises, including conditions that render parts of the premises effectively unusable. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 280–82 (1994); Jablonski v. Clemons, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 477–80 (2004).

38. A landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 when defective conditions violate the State Sanitary Code or materially impair the character and value of the leased premises for residential purposes. See Hemingway v. O’Brien, 363 Mass. 359, 366–69 (1973) (recognizing landlord’s duty to provide habitable premises and linking Sanitary Code violations to breach of implied warranty and related duties); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–03 (1979).

39. Defendant knew or should have known of the defective electrical condition in the Office Bedroom and its impact on Plaintiff’s ability to use that room and the Apartment as a whole, because:  
    a. Plaintiff reported the problem; and  
    b. Defendant’s own electrician confirmed the need for more extensive repair work.

40. Despite this knowledge, Defendant failed to remedy the electrical defect in a reasonable time and has left Plaintiff without electricity in the Office Bedroom for approximately six weeks.

41. Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain safe and adequate electrical service in the Office Bedroom violates the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.351–410.352, and constitutes a serious defect affecting habitability and use.

42. The unlawful condition has effectively deprived Plaintiff of the use of one of the two bedrooms she is renting, and has substantially interfered with her ability to work from home and to enjoy the Apartment in a normal and reasonable manner.

43. Substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, even when not a complete eviction, is sufficient to establish a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977) (noise from adjacent lounge); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 281–82 (1994) (failure to address persistent harassment); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982) (repeated flooding).

44. The measure of damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment includes actual and consequential damages, which may encompass loss of use and enjoyment, diminution in rental value, and out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred to mitigate or cope with the defective conditions. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 105–07 (1982); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

45. Plaintiff has incurred actual and consequential damages within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to:  
    a. Daily costs of coffee and food purchases at coffee shops (approximately $15 per day) to maintain a place to work;  
    b. Monthly coworking space membership fees of approximately $150 per month;  
    c. The loss of use of one of the two bedrooms in the Apartment for an extended period;  
    d. The effective reduction in the usable square footage and rental value of the Apartment; and  
    e. Stress, inconvenience, and disruption of her home life and work life.

46. The statutory remedy under G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord who interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997) (construing § 14); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979).

47. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200. Three months’ rent is therefore $3,600.

48. Although Plaintiff currently estimates her actual damages at not less than $450, she is entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 to recover the greater of her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, plus court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any), as well as such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

49. Defendant’s acts and omissions as described herein constitute “interference with quiet enjoyment” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the controlling case law, including but not limited to Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); and Jablonski v. Clemons, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004).

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered the injuries and damages described above and is entitled to statutory relief under G.L. c. 186, § 14.
