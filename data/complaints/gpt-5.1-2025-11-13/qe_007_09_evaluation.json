The opinion does not discuss recurrent or continuous noise, dust, or similar disturbances, nor does it articulate a standard that the covenant protects against substantial interference rendering premises significantly less fit for ordinary residential use.

The court emphasizes that liability may arise from what the landlord \"failed to do\" or \"permitted to be done,\" and remands for fact-finding on whether the landlord took adequate steps.

Gem argued that other tenants\u2019 misuse of plumbing caused the flooding and was beyond its control, but the court rejected that defense, holding Gem liable under \u00a7 14 because the flooding was a preventable condition the landlord had a duty to prevent.

Cf. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977). This contention echoes Gem\u2019s objections to the verdict for reckless infliction of emotional distress, and we reject it for the same reasons.

Wolfberg instead holds that tenants are entitled to damages equal to the difference between the rental value as warranted and as defective, plus expenses, with rent withheld then subtracted, and focuses on avoiding duplicative or inadequate recovery in the context of G.L. c. 93A and c. 186, \u00a7 14. It does not speak to the legal effect of a nominal discount as a purported abatement or waiver of liability.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We believe that the judge erred in thus resolving the issues raised by the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages. There has been a substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the apartment to which the tenants were entitled under their lease. This interference with a right guaranteed to them under their lease constitutes a loss of property to the tenants. They had a contractual right to enjoy the use of the apartment free of rodents. The judge found that the tenants withheld rent justifiably. Thus they were deprived of their contractual right by the landlord\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u2026 we hold, therefore, that where tenants who have withheld rent under G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A, or under the common law \u2026 prevail in a claim for damages under G. L. c. 93A, their damages under G. L. c. 93A shall be calculated by determining the rental value of the unit as warranted \u2014 the agreed rent \u2014 minus the value of the unit in a defective condition, plus any reasonable expenses incurred by the tenants as a result of the defective condition."
