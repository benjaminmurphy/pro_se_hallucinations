COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff, Jessica Mills (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Mills”), for her Complaint against Defendant, Lowell Home Goods, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Lowell Home Goods”), alleges as follows:

                               I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Mills is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, at all relevant times, was a lawful customer and business invitee at Defendant’s store located in Lowell, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Lowell Home Goods, Inc. is a Massachusetts business corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal place of business in Middlesex County, and at all relevant times owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained a retail “discount home-goods” store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its officers, employees, agents, and/or servants, was engaged in the retail sale of home goods, kitchenware, and related consumer products to the general public within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

                          II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum for the Superior Court, exclusive of interest and costs, and because this is a civil action over which the Superior Court has general original jurisdiction.

5. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is a Massachusetts corporation and, at all relevant times, conducted continuous and systematic business activities in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, including operating the retail premises where Plaintiff was injured. See, e.g., G.L. c. 223A, § 3(a).

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and/or 8 because Defendant’s store where the incident occurred is located in Middlesex County, Defendant transacts business in Middlesex County, and the cause of action arose in Middlesex County.

                           III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. On or about October 1, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful customer and business invitee at Defendant’s store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852 (the “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff was in the kitchenware area of the store, browsing and examining kitchen items offered for sale by Defendant.

9. In that area of the store, Defendant had stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens and other similar items, on shelving units to a height of approximately five to six boxes.

10. These appliance boxes were stored at or near head level and above, and they were heavy, bulky, and capable of causing significant injury if they fell.

11. Despite the foreseeable risk of falling merchandise, Defendant failed to use straps, rails, bars, netting, retainers, or other suitable barriers, restraints, or safety devices to prevent the stacked boxes from falling into the customer aisle.

12. Despite the foreseeable risk of injury, Defendant failed to post adequate warnings or signage to alert customers to any danger from overhead or high-stacked merchandise.

13. At all relevant times, Defendant controlled and was responsible for the inspection, stocking, arrangement, and maintenance of the shelves and merchandise in the store, including in the aisle where Plaintiff was injured.

14. Upon information and belief, Defendant’s employees regularly stacked multiple heavy appliance boxes vertically on the same shelves, creating a condition where a minor bump or vibration could cause upper boxes to shift and fall.

15. On October 1, 2023, while Plaintiff was in the kitchenware aisle, another customer pushed a shopping cart along the same aisle.

16. The other customer’s cart made a normal, foreseeable, and non-excessive contact with a lower shelf—a type of contact that is ordinary and reasonably anticipated in a crowded retail environment.

17. As a direct result of Defendant’s dangerous method of stacking, arranging, and securing the merchandise, the contact with the shelf caused a large toaster-oven box stored near the top of the shelving unit to become dislodged.

18. The toaster-oven box fell from a height, striking Plaintiff on the side of her head and shoulder.

19. The impact was sudden and forceful, causing Plaintiff immediate pain to her head and shoulder.

20. Almost immediately after being struck, Plaintiff became dizzy, lightheaded, and developed a severe headache.

21. Defendant’s manager and/or other employees came to the scene, observed the fallen box and Plaintiff’s condition, and completed an incident report documenting the incident.

22. Defendant’s manager offered Plaintiff a store coupon, but no adequate medical assistance, evaluation, or other meaningful remedial action was undertaken within the store.

23. That evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms—including dizziness, nausea, and headache—worsened.

24. Due to her worsening condition, Plaintiff sought emergency medical care at a local hospital emergency room.

25. At the emergency department, Plaintiff was evaluated and was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

26. Plaintiff was provided medical advice, including instructions to rest, limit physical exertion, and avoid activities that could aggravate her head and shoulder injuries.

27. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to perform her regular duties as a delivery driver for several days following the incident and missed work, resulting in lost wages of approximately $600.

28. Plaintiff’s injuries also prevented her from participating in her weekly recreational soccer league for approximately one month, depriving her of an important source of exercise, recreation, and enjoyment.

29. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200 to date, including costs of emergency room evaluation, imaging and diagnostic services as applicable, and follow-up treatment for her concussion and shoulder strain.

30. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain and discomfort in her shoulder, occasional headaches, and emotional distress associated with the incident and its aftermath.

31. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, stocking, and maintenance of the Premises, including the shelving and merchandise, to keep the store in a reasonably safe condition and to protect her against foreseeable risks of harm. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); LeBlanc v. Atlantic Bldg. & Supply Co., 323 Mass. 702, 706 (1949).

32. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that stacking heavy boxes of appliances several units high, near and above head level, without restraints or barriers, in an aisle open to the public, created a substantial risk that boxes could fall and injure customers if shelves were bumped or jostled during ordinary shopping.

33. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the dangerous condition created by its method of display and storage of heavy merchandise, and had a duty to correct it or warn of it. See, e.g., Barry v. Beverly Enters.-Mass., Inc., 418 Mass. 590, 592–93 (1994); Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–84 (2007).

34. Plaintiff did not create the dangerous condition, had no control over the stacking of the boxes, and had no reasonable means of discovering or avoiding the risk of falling merchandise.

35. Plaintiff was acting reasonably and with due care for her own safety at all relevant times.

36. The incident and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries were caused solely by Defendant’s negligence and the negligence of its employees, and not by any negligence or fault of Plaintiff.

37. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, headaches, dizziness, shoulder pain, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, lost wages, and medical expenses, and may incur additional medical expenses in the future.

                           IV. CAUSE OF ACTION
                          (Negligence – Premises)

38. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 37 above as if fully set forth herein.

39. Under Massachusetts law, a business owner in possession and control of premises open to the public owes its customers (business invitees) a duty of reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect them from foreseeable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); Humphrey v. Twin State Gas & Elec. Co., 100 Vt. 414, 421 (1927) (adopted in part in Mounsey).

40. This duty includes, but is not limited to, the obligations to:  
    a. properly design, stock, and arrange merchandise in a reasonably safe manner;  
    b. inspect the premises and merchandise displays at reasonable intervals;  
    c. correct dangerous conditions of which the owner knows or reasonably should know; and  
    d. provide adequate warnings where dangerous conditions cannot be made safe immediately. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–84 (2007); Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).

41. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in the stocking, stacking, and securing of the heavy appliance boxes in its store, and a duty to protect Plaintiff from the foreseeable risk that improperly secured overhead merchandise could fall and cause injury. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 (adopted in part in Massachusetts, see Davidson v. Arlington Bldg. Corp., 35 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1993)).

42. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by, among other acts and omissions, the following negligent conduct:

   a. Stacking multiple heavy boxes of appliances five to six units high on retail shelves in or above head-height zones in an area where customers walk, stand, and shop;  

   b. Failing to use restraints, straps, rails, netting, or other safety devices to prevent such heavy boxes from falling into customer aisles;  

   c. Failing to design or arrange its shelving and merchandise in a manner that would prevent foreseeable falling-object hazards;  

   d. Failing to inspect the shelving and merchandise displays adequately and at reasonable intervals to ensure that heavy boxes were stable and secure;  

   e. Failing to correct an unsafe and dangerous stacking condition that it knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known existed;  

   f. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other customers of the danger associated with overhead or high-stacked heavy merchandise;  

   g. Failing to adopt, implement, and/or enforce reasonable policies, procedures, and training for employees regarding the safe stocking and securing of heavy boxed merchandise; and  

   h. Otherwise failing to exercise due care under the circumstances, in violation of the standard of care required of reasonably prudent retail store operators in Massachusetts.

43. The dangerous condition at issue—improperly secured heavy merchandise stacked at a height above customers’ heads—was not “open and obvious” to Plaintiff in a manner that would negate Defendant’s duty, and even if it had been open and obvious, Defendant still owed a duty to take reasonable steps to remedy or guard against the danger where it reasonably should anticipate that lawful visitors would encounter it. See Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 338–39 (2010); Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 153–54 (2013).

44. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or business operator may be held liable where its own mode of operation or method of display creates a foreseeable risk of injury to customers, even absent proof of actual or constructive notice of the specific incident-causing condition. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 787–88.

45. Defendant’s chosen method of stacking heavy appliances vertically without restraint in close proximity to customers constituted an unreasonably dangerous “mode of operation,” creating a foreseeable risk of falling merchandise and harm to customers, including Plaintiff.

46. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that customers routinely use shopping carts, may accidentally bump or contact shelving, and may jostle merchandise while browsing, and that such foreseeable conduct could cause unsecured, high-stacked merchandise to fall.

47. It was reasonably foreseeable that if Defendant failed to safely stack and secure heavy boxes, a customer like Plaintiff could be struck by a falling box and suffer head, neck, shoulder, and other physical injuries.

48. Defendant’s negligence, as described above, was a direct and proximate cause of the incident on October 1, 2023 and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (defining duty, breach, causation, and foreseeability in negligence).

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following injuries and damages, among others:

   a. A mild concussion, causing headaches, dizziness, nausea, and cognitive and emotional distress;  

   b. A shoulder strain, causing pain, reduced mobility, and functional limitations;  

   c. Medical expenses of approximately $1,200 incurred to date, including emergency care and follow-up treatment, with a reasonable likelihood of additional medical expenses in the future;  

   d. Lost wages of approximately $600 as a result of missed work in her position as a delivery driver;  

   e. Loss of the ability to participate in her weekly soccer league and related recreational and social activities for approximately one month; and  

   f. Pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress.

50. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for personal injuries proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages and/or earning capacity, and compensation for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions); G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence standard).

51. Plaintiff’s own negligence, if any, was less than that of Defendant and, in any event, does not bar recovery under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute. See G.L. c. 231, § 85.

52. Plaintiff therefore seeks an award of fair and reasonable damages commensurate with the nature and extent of her injuries, including past and future pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages or earning capacity.

                           V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Mills respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Lowell Home Goods, Inc., and:

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be well in excess of the minimum jurisdictional amount of this Court, including but not limited to:

   1. Past and future medical expenses, including costs of emergency care, diagnostic testing, follow-up visits, medications, physical therapy, and any other reasonably necessary medical treatment;  

   2. Past and future lost wages and/or loss of earning capacity;  

   3. Compensation for physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life; and  

   4. Any other general or special damages allowed by law;

B. Award Plaintiff statutory prejudgment interest on the damages awarded, as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C. Award Plaintiff her taxable costs of this action, as allowed by law;

D. Order such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
