COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Cameron Lee (“Plaintiff” or “Tenant”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Jordan McCarthy (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Cameron Lee is an individual residing at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

2. Defendant Jordan McCarthy is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, controls, manages, and/or operates the residential rental premises located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Premises”), and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for violation of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The Boston Housing Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 2, and 3, in that this is a civil action between a landlord and a tenant concerning residential housing located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, which lies within the geographical jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, § 1; G.L. c. 185C, § 3.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

7. The Premises are a residential dwelling unit subject to the Massachusetts landlord‑tenant laws, including G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and applicable regulations and codes, including the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Premises is $1,500, payable to Defendant.

9. During the initial showing of the Premises, Plaintiff observed noticeable water stains on the ceiling of the apartment.

10. Plaintiff asked Defendant about these stains and was informed by Defendant that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”

11. Defendant’s representations regarding the leak being “totally fixed” were material to Plaintiff’s decision to enter into the tenancy.

12. Relying on Defendant’s assurances, Plaintiff entered into the tenancy and moved into the Premises.

13. Shortly after moving in, during the first significant rainstorm after the commencement of the tenancy, water began to drip through the ceiling at the same location as the prior water staining.

14. The water intrusion was not a minor or purely cosmetic issue; it consisted of active water leakage from the ceiling into the living space.

15. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak and requested repairs.

16. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant failed and refused to take timely and adequate steps to repair the leak.

17. Defendant repeatedly characterized the leak as a “minor cosmetic issue” and asserted that Plaintiff knew the apartment had “character” when Plaintiff signed the lease.

18. Over time, the water intrusion worsened during rainstorms.

19. During at least one storm, the leak became severe enough that water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined a laptop computer that Plaintiff had left on the coffee table.

20. The laptop was rendered unusable as a result of the water damage.

21. Plaintiff was required to replace the laptop at a cost of approximately $900.

22. The repeated water intrusion caused dampness and a musty odor in the Premises, particularly near the affected ceiling area.

23. After the leak persisted over multiple months, Plaintiff began to experience headaches that Plaintiff reasonably believes are related to moisture and possible mold growth resulting from the ongoing water intrusion.

24. The musty smell and continuing leak forced Plaintiff to move Plaintiff’s bed away from the affected area of the unit.

25. As a result, Plaintiff has effectively been compelled to live in only a reduced portion of the studio apartment and is unable to freely and safely use and enjoy the entire Premises.

26. Defendant has had actual notice of the leak and its effects on Plaintiff’s living conditions for an extended period of time.

27. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant has failed to take reasonable, prompt, and effective measures to stop the water intrusion, to remediate moisture‑related damage, or to correct any resulting unsanitary or unsafe conditions.

28. The conditions created by the continuing water intrusion, dampness, odor, and suspected mold materially impair Plaintiff’s health, safety, and use of the Premises.

29. The presence of persistent water leaks and conditions conducive to mold growth constitute violations of the State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500 (requiring premises to be free from chronic dampness and mold) and 105 C.M.R. 410.750 (requiring the owner to maintain the structure and structural elements in a safe and sanitary condition).

30. Under Massachusetts law, landlords have a duty to maintain residential premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and to refrain from acts or omissions that substantially interfere with tenants’ quiet enjoyment. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

31. Defendant’s failure to remedy the repeated and substantial leak, despite notice and opportunity, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

32. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises have been significantly and continuously disrupted, including but not limited to sleep disruption, inability to use the full space of the apartment, concern for health effects, and loss of property.

33. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent for the Premises during the period in which the leak and resulting conditions have persisted.

34. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including property damage (loss of the laptop computer and damage to furniture), loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, physical discomfort, and emotional distress.

35. Based on the property damage described above alone, Plaintiff has suffered at least $900 in out‑of‑pocket losses, in addition to non‑economic harms and loss of value of the tenancy.

36. Defendant’s conduct was at least negligent and, in light of repeated notice and continued refusal to address the problem, was willful, knowing, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

37. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for either actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with the costs of the action and a reasonable attorney’s fee.

39. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease or tenancy in Massachusetts. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–16 (1977).

40. The covenant protects tenants from serious interferences with the tenancy that are caused by the landlord or are within the landlord’s control. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Jablonski v. Clemons, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476–77 (2004).

41. A landlord’s failure to correct substantial defects or sanitary code violations that significantly interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–201; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–89 (1994).

42. Repeated water leaks, chronic dampness, and conditions conducive to mold growth that impair health or safety and substantially interfere with the tenant’s normal use of the premises constitute an “interference” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 203–04 (1979) (unrepaired conditions and code violations); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982) (landlord liable for serious interferences with habitability and mental tranquility).

43. Defendant had actual knowledge of the recurring water leaks and resulting conditions, as Plaintiff repeatedly complained to Defendant after the first major rainstorm and subsequent storms.

44. Defendant, despite such notice, failed to undertake timely and effective repairs to stop the leak and correct the resulting damage and sanitary violations.

45. Defendant’s inaction and dismissive characterization of the leak as merely a “minor cosmetic issue,” and assertion that Plaintiff accepted the apartment’s “character,” demonstrate that Defendant knowingly allowed the conditions to persist.

46. Defendant’s failure to act, in circumstances where Defendant had the power and obligation to correct the conditions, constitutes an indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–19 (landlord responsible for interference resulting from landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent or correct conditions within landlord’s control).

47. Defendant’s acts and omissions have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including, but not limited to:

   a. Repeated water intrusion into the living space;  
   b. Damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a laptop computer and furniture;  
   c. Persistent musty odor and suspected mold growth;  
   d. Physical symptoms including headaches reasonably attributable to the conditions; and  
   e. Restriction of Plaintiff’s use of the apartment to only a portion of the living area.

48. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law, Plaintiff need not prove a constructive eviction or abandonment of the premises in order to prevail on a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Doe v. Boston Hous. Auth., 473 Mass. 788, 806 (2016).

49. Plaintiff has in fact remained in possession and continued to pay rent, but has suffered a substantial diminution in the value of the tenancy and serious disruption to peaceful, safe, and healthful occupancy.

50. Defendant’s conduct, in light of repeated notice and the duration of the problem, was intentional, willful, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, justifying the imposition of the statutory minimum of three months’ rent in damages, or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 201–04 (treble damages and attorney’s fees are mandatory under § 14 upon a finding of violation).

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Out‑of‑pocket property damages of at least $900;  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Premises;  
   c. Physical discomfort and headaches; and  
   d. Stress, frustration, and anxiety related to living in unsafe and unhealthy conditions.

52. Plaintiff is entitled to recover either (a) actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to the $900 in property damage and the value of the loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, or (b) three months’ rent (3 × $1,500 = $4,500), whichever amount is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Cameron Lee respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against Defendant Jordan McCarthy and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than three months’ rent (presently $4,500) or Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to at least $900 in property damage, whichever is greater;

C. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, recognizing that, should Plaintiff later obtain counsel, such fees are recoverable;

D. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

E. Such further and other relief, at law or in equity, as this Court deems just and proper.

### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under the laws and Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 231, § 60; Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
Cameron Lee,
