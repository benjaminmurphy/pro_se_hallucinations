EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                   Civil Action No. __________  

FRESH FOODS GROCERY,

------------------------------------------------------  

### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY: PREMISES LIABILITY)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Fresh Foods Grocery (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is a citizen of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Fresh Foods Grocery is a business entity operating a retail grocery store located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02144, and is duly authorized to conduct business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, possessed, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the premises known as Fresh Foods Grocery at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Superior Court. See G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the cause of action arose within this county and the Premises where Plaintiff was injured is located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144, in Middlesex County. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 16, 2023, at approximately a Saturday afternoon hour, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a business invitee to shop for groceries.

8. Plaintiff entered the dairy aisle of the Premises in the normal course of shopping.

9. The floor of the dairy aisle contained a substantial puddle of spilled milk (the “Spill”) on the walking surface where customers, including Plaintiff, were expected and invited to walk.

10. The Spill was large enough that shopping cart tracks were visible going through it, indicating that other customers had already passed through the area and that the Spill had existed for some period of time prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

11. There were no visible warning cones, caution signs, “wet floor” signs, barriers, or other devices to alert customers to the existence of the Spill or to prevent customers from stepping into the Spill.

12. The Spill was not open and obvious to Plaintiff as she approached, and the floor surface was otherwise expected to be safe and dry in a grocery store aisle.

13. As Plaintiff walked in the dairy aisle, she stepped into the Spill, slipped, and fell forcefully to the floor, landing on her hip (the “Incident”).

14. At the time of the Incident, an employee of Defendant was stocking shelves in the dairy aisle approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the Spill.

15. After Plaintiff fell, the employee came over to Plaintiff and stated, in substance, that he had noticed the Spill “a few minutes ago,” but that he was finishing his stocking work before going to get a mop or otherwise address the Spill.

16. Defendant’s employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant’s agent and/or employee had actual knowledge of the Spill before Plaintiff fell, and that Defendant failed to take timely and reasonable steps to either clean up the Spill or warn customers, including Plaintiff, about the dangerous condition.

17. Defendant, through its employees, agents, and/or servants, failed to promptly respond to the known hazard and allowed the dangerous condition to persist in an area open to customer traffic.

18. Plaintiff, believing initially that she might be able to continue her day, completed her shopping and left the Premises.

19. Later that evening on September 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s hip pain substantially worsened.

20. On or about September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical evaluation at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain.

21. As a result of the Incident, Plaintiff required physical therapy for her hip injury.

22. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200 related to urgent care visits, diagnostic evaluation, and physical therapy.

23. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work several shifts at her café job and lost wages of approximately $800.

24. Plaintiff also suffered physical pain, soreness, limitation of movement, and discomfort, as well as inconvenience and disruption to her daily life and activities.

25. Plaintiff continues to experience, to varying degrees, pain and discomfort in her hip, and has suffered and may continue to suffer pain and loss of enjoyment of life.

26. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for its business invitees, including Plaintiff, and to protect invitees against risks of harm that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–709 (1973).

27. Defendant, through its employees and agents, failed to act reasonably under the circumstances and breached its duty of care to Plaintiff by allowing the Spill to remain on the floor without timely cleanup or adequate warning.

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence (Premises Liability)**

29. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully set forth herein.

30. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or occupier who invites members of the public onto its premises for business purposes owes a duty of reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect lawful visitors against foreseeable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–709 (1973); Wilbur v. Gross, 421 Mass. 718, 721–22 (1996).

31. This duty includes the obligation to use reasonable care to (a) inspect for dangerous conditions; (b) discover and remedy hazards on the premises; and (c) warn invitees of dangers which the owner knows or reasonably should know about and which invitees are unlikely to discover on their own. See Polak v. Whitney, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 353–54 (1985); Johnson v. Warrington, 2012 Mass. App. Div. 219, 220–21.

32. A business proprietor such as Defendant has a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep aisles, passageways, and floors of its store reasonably safe for customers, and to take reasonable steps to remedy or warn of spills and slippery substances on the floor. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973); Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc., 332 Mass. 560, 562–63 (1955).

33. Defendant, through its employees, agents, and/or servants, had actual knowledge of the Spill because the employee stocking shelves near the Spill admitted that he had noticed the Spill “a few minutes” before Plaintiff’s fall.

34. Alternatively, Defendant had constructive knowledge of the Spill because, based on the visible cart tracks and the location of the employee in close proximity to the Spill, the Spill existed for a sufficient length of time that, in the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant should have discovered and remedied it. See Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961) (constructive notice from duration and circumstances of foreign substance); Anjou v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., 208 Mass. 273, 274–76 (1911) (condition of banana peel supported finding it had been on the ground long enough to charge defendant with notice).

35. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to the following negligent acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to promptly clean up the Spill after actual or constructive notice of its existence;

   b. Failing to place warning signs, cones, barriers, or other visual cues around the Spill to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous slippery condition;

   c. Failing to implement and/or follow reasonable inspection, maintenance, and cleanup procedures for aisles and walking surfaces in the store, particularly in areas like the dairy aisle where spills are foreseeable;

   d. Permitting a known slippery condition to remain on the floor where Defendant knew or should have known that customers would be walking;

   e. Failing to adequately train, supervise, and/or instruct its employees regarding timely response to spills and hazardous conditions;

   f. Failing otherwise to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees, including Plaintiff.

36. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff in a negligence action must show the existence of a duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000). Plaintiff alleges each of these elements is satisfied here.

37. Defendant’s failure to address the Spill for “a few minutes” after its employee first noticed it, while continuing to allow customers to walk through the dairy aisle without warning, constituted a breach of Defendant’s duty of reasonable care under the circumstances. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–84 (2007) (discussing premises liability standard and reasonable care with respect to foreign substances on floors).

38. The danger posed by a puddle of spilled milk on a grocery store floor in a customer aisle was foreseeable, as slippery liquid on a smooth floor is likely to cause customers to slip and fall, especially in a busy store on a Saturday afternoon.

39. Defendant reasonably should have anticipated that customers, including Plaintiff, would not recognize the specific danger posed by the Spill in time to protect themselves, and that without timely cleanup or adequate warning, customers would encounter the hazard. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013) (duty to take reasonable steps in light of foreseeable risks).

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped, fell, and suffered a hip sprain and related bodily injuries.

41. But for Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in inspecting, maintaining, and cleaning its floors, and its failure to warn Plaintiff of the Spill, Plaintiff would not have slipped, fallen, or sustained injuries.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:

   a. Medical expenses, including urgent care treatment, diagnostic evaluations, and physical therapy, in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,200, and to be proven more fully at trial;

   b. Lost wages and loss of income resulting from missed shifts at her café job, presently estimated at approximately $800, and to be proven more fully at trial;

   c. Physical pain and suffering, including pain in her hip, soreness, and limitations on movement;

   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life associated with her injuries and the recovery process;

   e. Any future medical expenses and loss of earning capacity that may reasonably be incurred as a result of the injuries sustained, to the extent shown by the evidence at trial.

43. Plaintiff’s own conduct was at all relevant times reasonable under the circumstances. To the extent any comparative negligence is claimed by Defendant, Plaintiff denies such allegations and asserts that any negligence on Defendant’s part was the primary and substantial cause of her injuries. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence statute).

44. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to her medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other consequential damages. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85; Ulwick v. DeChristopher, 411 Mass. 401, 406 (1991).

---

### V. DAMAGES

45. Plaintiff incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 44 as if fully set forth herein.

46. Plaintiff seeks recovery for all special damages (including but not limited to her medical expenses and lost wages) and all general damages (including but not limited to pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life) arising from Defendant’s negligence.

47. Plaintiff additionally seeks statutory prejudgment interest on any judgment entered in her favor, as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

48. Plaintiff’s total damages are reasonably expected to exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and will be determined by the trier of fact at trial.

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND

49. Pursuant to Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Fresh Foods Grocery, and grant the following relief:

   3. Past and future pain and suffering;
