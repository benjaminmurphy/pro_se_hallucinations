JORDAN SMITH,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

LINDA JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  


COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY / PREMISES LIABILITY)


Plaintiff Jordan Smith (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Linda Johnson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an adult individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Linda Johnson is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner, manager, and/or person in control of the three‑unit residential property located at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, controlled, managed, and/or was otherwise responsible for the care, maintenance, and condition of the sidewalk and means of ingress and egress adjacent to and serving the Property at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional requirements of this Court for a civil action and is within the monetary jurisdiction of the Worcester District Court, G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A.

6. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 223, § 3 because the causes of action arose in Worcester, Massachusetts and the Property and accident at issue are located in Worcester.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Defendant is and was, at all times relevant, the owner and person in control of the three‑unit apartment building and surrounding premises located at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

8. The Property includes, and is served by, a sidewalk running along the front of the building which provides access to the entrances used by tenants, their guests, invitees, delivery persons, and members of the public lawfully on the premises.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant maintained and exercised control over the maintenance, snow and ice removal, and general condition of the sidewalk area providing access to the Property.

10. On or about February 13–15, 2023, Worcester, Massachusetts experienced a significant winter snowstorm resulting in an accumulation of snow and ice on sidewalks and walkways, including at the Property.

11. After the snowstorm, Defendant undertook to clear the sidewalk at the Property by shoveling a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk.

12. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or any other de‑icing material to that path, and failed to otherwise treat the surface so as to make it reasonably safe for foreseeable pedestrian use.

13. Over the next couple of days following the storm, temperatures fluctuated above and below freezing, resulting in melting during the day and refreezing at night.

14. As a result of Defendant’s inadequate and negligent treatment of the sidewalk, the narrow shoveled path became a sheet of ice, creating a slippery and dangerous condition (the “ice patch”) on the sidewalk at the Property.

15. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff was working as a grocery delivery person and was lawfully on the premises at 45 Elm Street to deliver groceries to one of Defendant’s tenants.

16. Plaintiff was an invitee and/or lawful visitor to the Property, present for the mutual benefit of the tenant and Defendant, and for purposes that Defendant knew or reasonably should have foreseen.

17. On February 15, 2023, while walking up the sidewalk on the narrow shoveled path provided by Defendant as the obvious means of access to the building, Plaintiff encountered the ice patch.

18. The ice patch was located on the narrow path that had been shoveled by Defendant and was not reasonably avoidable by a person using the sidewalk to access the building.

19. As Plaintiff proceeded along the path in a normal and reasonable manner, Plaintiff’s feet suddenly slipped out from under him on the ice patch.

20. Plaintiff fell backwards violently and landed hard on his lower back on the icy, frozen surface of the sidewalk.

21. Immediately upon falling, Plaintiff experienced severe pain in his lower back and significant difficulty standing and moving.

22. After the incident, tenants at 45 Elm Street informed Plaintiff that, prior to Plaintiff’s fall, they had observed the icy condition on the sidewalk and had notified Defendant of the dangerous condition.

23. On information and belief, tenants had texted Defendant, sent her photographs of the icy condition, and specifically warned Defendant that the sidewalk path was hazardous.

24. On information and belief, Defendant responded to tenant complaints by stating words to the effect that “the sun will take care of it,” and took no further remedial action to salt, sand, or otherwise treat the ice patch.

25. Defendant thus had actual notice and knowledge of the specific icy condition on the sidewalk path leading to the building at 45 Elm Street prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

26. Defendant failed to warn tenants, invitees, delivery persons, and lawful visitors such as Plaintiff of the existence of the icy condition.

27. Defendant failed to cordon off, block, or close the dangerous area, and left the icy path as the main and apparent means of travel to and from the building.

28. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or de‑icing materials after receiving specific notice of the ice patch, and failed to re‑shovel, chip away, or otherwise remove the ice despite ample time and opportunity to do so.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, Plaintiff slipped and fell on February 15, 2023, at approximately 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, on the sidewalk controlled and maintained by Defendant.

30. As a further direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained injury to his lower back, resulting in significant pain, limited mobility, and physical impairment.

31. Plaintiff required and obtained medical evaluation and treatment for his lower back injury, including but not limited to physician visits and related services.

32. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses as a result of the injuries sustained in the February 15, 2023 fall.

33. Plaintiff also missed approximately one week of work and thereby sustained lost wages of approximately $1,000 as a result of his injuries.

34. Plaintiff continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limitations in mobility as a result of the injuries to his lower back.

35. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and impairment of his ability to perform normal activities of daily living.

36. Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to properly remove and treat snow and ice and to maintain the sidewalk at the Property in a reasonably safe condition.

---

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (SOLE COUNT)

37. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 36 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

38. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of premises owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors, including invitees such as delivery persons, to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973).

39. This duty includes a duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would under the circumstances to discover and remedy dangerous conditions that the owner knows or reasonably should know about, and to warn lawful visitors of such conditions when they cannot be made safe. *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995); *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837, 842 (1987).

40. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of 45 Elm Street and the adjacent sidewalk used as access to the Property, owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to keep the sidewalk and means of ingress and egress in a reasonably safe condition, to remove or treat snow and ice accumulations within a reasonable time, and to warn reasonable foreseeable visitors of any dangerous conditions. *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 152–53 (2013); *Barry v. Beverly Enters.-Mass., Inc.*, 418 Mass. 590, 592–93 (1994).

41. Since *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), Massachusetts law applies the same reasonable care standard to the removal of snow and ice as it does to other hazards, without distinction between “natural” and “unnatural” accumulations. Property owners must act reasonably under the circumstances to prevent injuries from snow and ice. *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 383–84.

42. Defendant’s duty is further informed by G.L. c. 231, § 85, which establishes comparative negligence principles but does not diminish Defendant’s primary duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors, and by G.L. c. 84, §§ 15–18, which, while directed primarily at municipal liability for defects in public ways, reflect a public policy that ways used by the public should be maintained in reasonably safe condition.

**Breach**

43. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff and other lawful visitors in multiple respects, including but not limited to:

   a. Failing to properly remove snow and ice from the sidewalk and means of access to 45 Elm Street within a reasonable time after the storm;  

   b. Creating and/or maintaining a narrow, inadequately treated shoveled path which, given foreseeable melting and refreezing, was likely to become dangerously icy;  

   c. Failing to apply reasonable and customary de‑icing treatments such as salt, sand, or other ice‑melt products to the shoveled path;  

   d. Failing to periodically inspect the sidewalk and path after the storm and after temperature fluctuations, despite the foreseeability of refreezing and the development of ice patches;  

   e. Failing to remedy the specific ice patch on the sidewalk path after receiving actual notice and photographic evidence of the dangerous condition from tenants;  

   f. Failing to warn invitees, including Plaintiff, of the existence of the hazardous icy condition;  

   g. Failing to barricade, close, or otherwise restrict use of the dangerous icy path when Defendant knew or should have known that it was unsafe; and  

   h. Choosing to rely on “the sun” to eliminate the hazardous condition rather than taking reasonable, affirmative steps to make the sidewalk safe.

44. A reasonably prudent property owner in the same or similar circumstances would have recognized that a narrow, unsalted, unsanded shoveled path would, with daytime melting and nighttime refreezing, become extremely slippery and hazardous, and would have taken timely steps to salt, sand, or otherwise treat the surface or to provide an alternative safe path.

45. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care required by Massachusetts law and constituted negligence. *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 383–84; *Sullivan v. Brookline*, 416 Mass. 825, 828–29 (1994) (duty to use reasonable care in snow and ice removal); *Alter v. Newton*, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 146–47 (1993).

46. Defendant’s knowledge of the dangerous icy condition is established by the prior complaints and photographs sent by tenants, which constitute actual notice. See *Gill v. Boston Post Rd. Dev. Corp.*, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 895, 895–96 (1980) (actual or constructive notice of hazardous condition required for premises liability).

47. Even apart from actual notice, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazard because the dangerous condition existed for a sufficient period of time after the storm and through repeated melt‑and‑refreeze cycles that a reasonably careful owner would have discovered and corrected it. *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 784–85 (2007); *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

**Causation**

48. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries.

49. But for Defendant’s failure to properly remove or treat the snow and ice and to respond reasonably to the tenants’ complaints and photographs, the ice patch on which Plaintiff slipped would not have existed or would have been remedied, and Plaintiff would not have fallen.

50. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—slipping on an icy surface and sustaining a back injury—is a foreseeable consequence of failing to exercise reasonable care in the treatment of snow and ice on a walkway. *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 383–84; *Jerlun, Inc. v. Broderick*, 458 Mass. 295, 303–04 (2010).

**Damages**

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered an injury to his lower back, causing pain, limited mobility, and physical impairment.

52. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses for evaluation and treatment of his injuries in the approximate amount of $2,500.

53. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff missed approximately one week of work and incurred lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000. See *Griffiths v. Powers*, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1980) (lost wages recoverable as an element of damages in negligence).

54. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of his injuries.

55. Plaintiff reasonably anticipates the possibility of future pain, discomfort, and limitations as a result of his injuries.

56. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and all other damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence. *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 548–49 (1982); *Warren v. Ballard*, 134 Mass. 208, 209 (1883).

**Comparative Negligence**

57. Plaintiff denies any negligence on his own part; however, to the extent any negligence might be alleged or found, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s contributory negligence, if any, does not bar recovery so long as it is not greater than the negligence of Defendant, and any damages shall be diminished only in proportion to any such negligence attributed to Plaintiff.

58. Plaintiff was walking in a normal, reasonable manner on the only apparent and intended path provided by Defendant, and there was no open and obvious alternative safe route. Under Massachusetts law, the alleged “open and obvious” nature of a condition does not eliminate a landowner’s duty when the owner should anticipate that lawful entrants will nonetheless encounter the danger. *Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n, Inc.*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 337–38 (2010); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. at 156–57.
