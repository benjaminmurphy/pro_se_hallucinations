COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PERSONAL INJURY – MINOR CHILD)  


PLAINTIFFS, MICHAEL JOHNSON, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS PARENT AND NEXT FRIEND OF HIS MINOR SON, J.J., ASSERT THE FOLLOWING CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENCE AGAINST DEFENDANT BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER:


                                     PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Michael Johnson (“Mr. Johnson”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father and legal guardian of his minor son, J.J. (“Minor Plaintiff” or “J.J.”).

2. At all relevant times, Mr. Johnson brings this action on his own behalf for economic losses and on behalf of J.J. as parent and next friend pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 17(a)–(c).

3. Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts non‑profit or other organized entity doing business in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and operating an after‑school youth program at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, supervised, and controlled the community center premises and the after‑school program attended by J.J., and employed or otherwise controlled the staff responsible for supervising children in its gym.


                           JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, in that Plaintiffs seek damages within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court arising from a tort committed within the Commonwealth.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is organized under the laws of Massachusetts and/or regularly transacts business in Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

7. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the cause of action arose in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, where Defendant’s community center is located and where the incident occurred.


                           FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. Defendant operates an after‑school program for children at its community center located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301.

9. Defendant advertises and represents that children in its after‑school program will be “supervised at all times” while in the gym and in its care.

10. On or about September 15, 2023, J.J., then eight (8) years old and small for his age, was enrolled in and attending Defendant’s after‑school program at the Brockton Community Center.

11. On that date, J.J. was present in Defendant’s gymnasium along with approximately twenty (20) other children participating in after‑school activities.

12. At the time of the incident, Defendant’s policies and/or representations called for at least two staff members to be present in the gym to supervise the group of children.

13. Contrary to those policies and representations, one of the two staff members assigned to supervise the children in the gym left to complete paperwork in an office, leaving only a single staff member in the gym.

14. The remaining staff member was, upon information and belief, an employee, agent, or servant of Defendant acting within the scope of her employment.

15. Rather than actively supervising the children, the remaining staff member positioned herself near the bleachers and spent substantial time looking at or using her cell phone.

16. While supervision was lax and inattentive, two older boys, approximately twelve (12) years old, began playing an aggressive and rough tackle game on the hardwood gym floor.

17. The rough play involved tackling and wrestling on the hard surface, was clearly visible, and created an obvious and unreasonable risk of physical injury to smaller and younger children present, including J.J.

18. Several children informed the staff member of this rough, tackle‑style play and the danger it posed.

19. Despite being put on notice of the dangerous conduct, the staff member responded dismissively with words to the effect of “boys will be boys” and failed to intervene, stop the rough play, separate the boys, or implement any safer activity or supervision.

20. The staff member did not direct the older boys to stop, did not remove them from the gym, did not summon additional staff, and did not take any reasonable steps to protect the younger children, including J.J.

21. Defendant, through its employee, thus allowed dangerous and unsupervised rough‑housing to continue in a mixed‑age group on a hard gym floor, in violation of basic child‑care safety practices and Defendant’s own advertised promises of continuous supervision.

22. As the rough tackle game continued, one of the bigger boys violently tackled J.J., driving him into the hardwood floor.

23. J.J. struck his head forcefully on the gym floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

24. Emergency medical services were called, and J.J. was transported to the emergency room.

25. At the emergency room, J.J. was diagnosed with a concussion and related head injury.

26. As a direct result of this incident, J.J. missed several days of school and experienced pain, headaches, disorientation, and emotional distress.

27. J.J.’s medical treatment, including emergency room care and follow‑up treatment, has resulted in medical expenses of approximately Five Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($5,500.00), and may reasonably be expected to continue.

28. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Mr. Johnson lost approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) in wages due to time taken off from work to care for J.J., attend medical appointments, and manage the consequences of the injury.

29. Defendant, acting through its employees, agents, and/or servants, owed J.J. a duty to exercise reasonable care to supervise him and to protect him from foreseeable harm while he was in its after‑school program and under its control. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 50–52 (1983); Wallace v. Wilson, 411 Mass. 8, 12–13 (1991).

30. Children under the care of youth programs and community centers are invitees to whom the operator owes a duty of reasonable care, including supervision appropriate to their age and vulnerability and to the risks inherent in the activities being conducted. See Flood v. Sargent, 366 Mass. 99, 103–05 (1974).

31. Rough, unsupervised tackle play among older and larger boys in proximity to smaller and younger children on a hard gym floor presents a clearly foreseeable risk of serious injury, especially to a small eight‑year‑old child like J.J.

32. Reasonable care under the circumstances required, at minimum: (a) providing the promised level of staff supervision; (b) active monitoring of children in the gym; (c) promptly stopping dangerous rough‑housing; (d) separating older and younger children when play turned rough; and (e) implementing and enforcing rules prohibiting tackle‑style games on hard surfaces.

33. Defendant failed to take any of these reasonable measures.

34. Defendant’s negligence created an unreasonable risk of physical harm, and that risk materialized in the form of J.J.’s concussion and related injuries.

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.J. has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, and impairment of normal activities appropriate to his age.

36. Mr. Johnson has incurred, and will continue to incur, medical expenses on behalf of his minor son, lost wages, and other economic damages, and has suffered emotional distress associated with his son’s injury.

37. But for Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, the incident and resulting injuries to J.J. would not have occurred.


                               CAUSE OF ACTION  
                                NEGLIGENCE  
         (Brought by Michael Johnson, Individually and as Parent and  
                    Next Friend of Minor Plaintiff J.J.)

38. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 37 as if fully set forth herein.

                                   Duty

39. Defendant owed J.J., as a minor child lawfully on its premises and enrolled in its after‑school program, a duty to exercise reasonable care to supervise him and to protect him from unreasonable risk of physical harm. See Flood v. Sargent, 366 Mass. 99, 103–05 (1974) (duty of care to invitees); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 50–52 (1983) (duty based on special relationship and control); Panagakos v. Collins, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 697, 700–01 (2011) (duty to protect minors from foreseeable harm).

40. A special relationship existed between Defendant and J.J. because Defendant undertook to provide care, custody, and supervision of J.J. in its after‑school program, thereby assuming responsibility for his safety during the hours of program operation. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 50–52; Commonwealth v. Welansky, 316 Mass. 383, 397–99 (1944) (duty arises from control of premises and persons).

41. Defendant’s advertising and representations that children would be “supervised at all times” in the gym further reinforced and defined this duty of care, reasonably inducing parents such as Mr. Johnson to rely on that promise. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 51–52 (duty informed by representations and expectations of safety).

42. Defendant also had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the hiring, training, supervision, and retention of its staff responsible for supervising children in the gym, so as to ensure that those employees were competent and attentive to child safety. See Foster v. The Loft, Inc., 26 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 291–93 (1988).

                                  Breach

43. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, breached its duty of reasonable care in numerous ways, including but not limited to:

   a. Failing to provide the promised and necessary number of staff to supervise approximately twenty children in the gym, when one staff member abandoned her post to do paperwork in an office;

   b. Allowing the remaining staff member to engage with her cell phone and remain largely inattentive rather than actively supervising children engaged in physical play;

   c. Failing to respond appropriately when notified by other children that two older boys were engaged in dangerous rough tackle play on a hard gym floor;

   d. Dismissing such reports with the statement “boys will be boys,” instead of intervening promptly to stop the dangerous conduct;

   e. Failing to separate older, larger boys from younger, smaller children when play became rough and posed a foreseeable risk of serious injury;

   f. Permitting tackle‑style games and rough‑housing on a hard gym floor without adequate supervision, safety rules, or enforcement;

   g. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable policies and procedures designed to prevent exactly this type of foreseeable injury to children in its care; and

   h. Failing to adequately train, supervise, and discipline staff regarding child safety and appropriate responses to rough or dangerous play.

44. A reasonably prudent operator of an after‑school program in Massachusetts, under like circumstances and with knowledge of the mixed ages and number of children present, would not have permitted unsupervised or minimally supervised rough tackle play in a gymnasium, and would have taken steps to stop such play immediately upon notice. See Wallace v. Wilson, 411 Mass. 8, 12–13 (1991) (reasonable care under circumstances); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–98 (2000) (foreseeability informs standard of care).

45. Defendant’s failure to use reasonable care in supervising and protecting J.J. from foreseeable harm constitutes a breach of its duty under Massachusetts common law of negligence. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 147–49 (2006) (elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, damages); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 742–44 (1995).

                                Causation

46. Defendant’s acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of J.J.’s injuries. Had Defendant exercised reasonable care—by maintaining adequate staffing, actively supervising, and promptly stopping the dangerous tackle game—J.J. would not have been tackled and would not have suffered a concussion.

47. The harm to J.J. was reasonably foreseeable: children rough‑housing and tackling on a hard gym floor, especially when older and larger children are involved with younger and smaller children, presents an obvious risk of significant injury. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639–41 (1996) (foreseeability of harm critical to negligence analysis).

48. There were no superseding or intervening causes sufficient to break the causal chain between Defendant’s negligence and J.J.’s injuries. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–22 (2002).

                                  Damages

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Minor Plaintiff J.J. sustained a concussion and related head injuries, causing:

   a. Physical pain and suffering;

   b. Headaches, dizziness, and disorientation;

   c. Loss of consciousness and associated trauma;

   d. Interference with normal childhood activities and schooling, including several days of missed school; and

   e. Emotional distress and anxiety related to the incident and its aftermath.

50. J.J. has suffered, and may continue to suffer, pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of his injuries.

51. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6D, J.J.’s injuries constitute a “serious injury,” including at minimum medical expenses in excess of the statutory threshold and impairment of bodily function.

52. Mr. Johnson, as J.J.’s parent, has incurred medical expenses on behalf of his minor son in the approximate amount of Five Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($5,500.00), and may incur additional medical and related expenses in the future. See G.L. c. 231, § 85L (claims relating to injury of minor children).

53. Mr. Johnson has lost approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) in wages due to time taken off from work to care for J.J. and attend medical appointments.

54. Mr. Johnson has suffered emotional distress and mental anguish associated with witnessing and dealing with his young son’s injury and recovery.

55. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 85 & 85K, Plaintiffs seek full compensatory damages for all injuries and losses caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to: medical expenses; lost wages and lost earning capacity (if any); pain and suffering; loss of enjoyment of life; and any other damages allowed by Massachusetts law.

56. To the extent any comparative negligence defenses are raised, Plaintiffs affirmatively state that J.J., as an eight‑year‑old child, cannot be held to an adult standard of care and did not act unreasonably under the circumstances. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Gage v. Westfield, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 691–92 (1989) (standard of care for minors).

57. Defendant is liable for the negligence of its employees, agents, and/or servants under the doctrine of respondeat superior, as those individuals were acting within the course and scope of their employment at all relevant times. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).

58. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiffs have suffered damages well within, but approaching, the jurisdictional limits of this Court, and Plaintiffs seek an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, but in any event in excess of the minimum amount required for this Court’s jurisdiction.


                             PRAYER FOR RELIEF
