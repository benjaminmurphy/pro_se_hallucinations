----------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Robert Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an adult individual who resides in the second‑floor apartment at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02144.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Robert Thompson is an adult individual who owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02144 (the “Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

5. The amount of damages claimed is approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200), exclusive of interest, costs, and any statutory multiple damages and attorneys’ fees, and is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and applicable District Court venue rules because the Property is located in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendant for the second‑floor apartment at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144 (the “Premises”).

8. Pursuant to the Lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent in the amount of One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800.00), which Plaintiff has paid or duly tendered as required.

9. The Lease expressly states that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.

10. In addition to the express lease provision, Massachusetts law implies in every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977); Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36 (1929).

11. The property at 123 Elm Street is a three‑family “triple‑decker” building, with units on the first, second, and third floors. Plaintiff occupies the second‑floor unit.

12. Approximately six months prior to the filing of this Complaint, new tenants moved into the third‑floor unit directly above Plaintiff (the “Upstairs Tenants”). The Upstairs Tenants are also tenants of Defendant at the same Property.

13. Almost immediately after the Upstairs Tenants’ move‑in, Plaintiff began experiencing persistent, excessive noise from the third‑floor unit, including but not limited to:

   a. Loud stomping and heavy footfalls at all hours of the day and night;

   b. Music played at high volume late into the evening and nighttime;

   c. Repeated sounds of furniture being dragged, dropped, or moved—often around or after midnight.

14. The noise from the Upstairs Tenants is clearly audible inside Plaintiff’s bedroom and living areas and is of such volume, frequency, and duration that it substantially interferes with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and use and enjoy her home.

15. Plaintiff averages only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night as a direct result of the constant, excessive noise originating from the third‑floor unit.

16. The noise disturbances have been ongoing, frequent, and long‑term, persisting for several months, often occurring late at night and in the early morning hours.

17. Plaintiff, acting reasonably, first attempted to resolve the problem directly and informally by speaking with the Upstairs Tenants and asking them to be quieter and to observe normal quiet hours.

18. For approximately one week following Plaintiff’s initial request, the Upstairs Tenants slightly reduced their noise, but they soon resumed the same pattern of loud stomping, late‑night music, and furniture moving.

19. Thereafter, Plaintiff contacted Defendant multiple times to complain about the noise and to request that he take appropriate steps to remedy the situation.

20. Plaintiff made such complaints to Defendant on approximately five or six separate occasions over a period of several months, including written and/or oral complaints.

21. Defendant did speak with the Upstairs Tenants on at least one occasion, but the disturbances continued, and Defendant failed to take adequate follow‑up actions to correct or abate the ongoing interference.

22. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant stated to Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live” or words to that effect, indicating that he would not take further meaningful steps to address the problem.

23. Despite being placed on clear and repeated notice of the severe and ongoing noise, Defendant failed and refused to:

   a. Enforce reasonable noise and disturbance provisions of the leases;

   b. Issue written warnings or notices to the Upstairs Tenants;

   c. Establish or enforce house rules regarding quiet hours;

   d. Take reasonable steps to soundproof or otherwise mitigate the noise;

   e. Commence any tenancy termination or eviction procedures against the Upstairs Tenants for their persistent disturbances; or

   f. Take any other effective measures reasonably calculated to abate the noise.

24. Defendant’s inaction and dismissive response effectively condoned or acquiesced in the conduct of the Upstairs Tenants and allowed the disturbance to continue unabated. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord may be liable for interference with quiet enjoyment caused by other tenants when landlord’s actions or inactions make the interference foreseeable and unremedied).

25. As a foreseeable and direct consequence of the sustained noise and Defendant’s failure to remedy it, Plaintiff suffered significant sleep deprivation, stress, anxiety, and disruption of her daily life.

26. Plaintiff has received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk, which directly resulted from her ongoing inability to obtain sufficient sleep at the Premises.

27. Plaintiff’s work‑related warning jeopardizes her employment status and job security, causing additional emotional distress and anxiety.

28. Plaintiff consulted her physician because of sleep problems, fatigue, and related symptoms. Her physician prescribed sleep medication to address her difficulty sleeping.

29. Plaintiff now incurs medical expenses of approximately Forty Dollars ($40.00) per month for sleep medication prescribed to address the sleep deprivation caused by the disturbances at the Premises.

30. In an effort to mitigate the problem on her own, Plaintiff purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranged her bedroom, but these measures have not adequately reduced or eliminated the interference caused by the noise from the third‑floor unit.

31. The ongoing disturbances and the Landlord’s failure to correct them have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and have rendered the Premises significantly less habitable and comfortable than what Plaintiff reasonably expected at the time she entered into the Lease.

32. The interference Plaintiff experiences is not trivial or transient; it is substantial, unreasonable, and of a kind that a reasonable tenant would find materially impairs the use and enjoyment of a dwelling. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 716–18; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

33. Plaintiff has remained current on her rent payments at all relevant times, notwithstanding the substantial interference with her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

34. Plaintiff estimates her actual damages resulting from the loss of quiet enjoyment, loss of use, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, work‑related harm, and out‑of‑pocket medical and mitigation expenses at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200), exclusive of any statutory multiple damages, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.

35. Upon information and belief, Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that failure to respond meaningfully to Plaintiff’s repeated complaints about serious, ongoing noise from another tenant would result in a substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

36. Defendant’s conduct and omissions, in the face of repeated notice, constitute at least negligent, and, in the context of his express statement that he “can’t control how people live,” arguably willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

37. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

38. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly applied G.L. c. 186, § 14 to protect tenants from substantial interferences with quiet enjoyment caused by the acts of third parties where the landlord is in a position to control or prevent the interference. See, e.g.:

   a. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where tenants’ enjoyment interfered with by noise from lounge operated on premises; landlord’s actions and relationship to wrongdoer made interference foreseeable);

   b. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (public housing authority may be liable for failing to protect tenant from criminal acts of neighbor where interference with quiet enjoyment is substantial and authority had knowledge/ability to act);

   c. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (damages and attorneys’ fees under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for landlord’s interference with tenant’s use of premises);

   d. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (recognizing damages for severe and recurring interference with use and enjoyment of premises and attendant emotional distress);

   e. Aguayo v. Donahue, 2012 Mass. App. Div. 113 (App. Div.) (awarding damages for landlord’s interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment);

   f. Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment);

   g. Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929) (quiet enjoyment covenant protects tenant from substantial interference with use of premises);

   h. Rubin v. Prescott, 362 Mass. 281 (1972) (implied covenant of quiet enjoyment recognized and enforced);

   i. Jablonski v. Clemons, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2004) (discussing landlord’s obligation and remedies under G.L. c. 186, § 14);

   j. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (per curiam) (finding interference with quiet enjoyment where landlord failed to act reasonably to prevent continuing disturbance).

39. Plaintiff brings this Complaint solely for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Common Law)

40. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 39 as if fully set forth herein.

41. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the Lease, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

42. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants against serious and substantial interference with their tenancy by the landlord or by others for whom the landlord is legally responsible, or whose conduct the landlord has the power to control. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 716–18; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 283–84.

43. By leasing and controlling the third‑floor unit above Plaintiff’s Premises, having the power to regulate the conduct of the Upstairs Tenants, and being repeatedly notified of the severe noise disturbances caused by those tenants, Defendant was in a position to prevent or abate the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

44. Defendant, despite repeated notice over an extended period, failed to take reasonable and effective measures to stop or significantly reduce the noise, such as enforcing lease provisions, issuing written warnings, initiating tenancy termination proceedings, or otherwise acting in a manner reasonably calculated to protect Plaintiff’s rights.

45. Defendant’s failure to act, coupled with his statement that he “can’t control how people live,” constitutes at least negligent, and in context arguably willful, interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord liable where failure to take appropriate action contributed to continuing disturbance); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–06.

46. The persistent, excessive noise from the third‑floor unit has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises by, among other things:

   a. Preventing Plaintiff from obtaining normal, restorative sleep;

   b. Causing ongoing stress, anxiety, and emotional distress;

   c. Disrupting Plaintiff’s daily routine and ability to function at work;

   d. Forcing Plaintiff to undertake mitigation measures at her own expense which have proven ineffective;

   e. Rendering the Premises significantly less habitable and comfortable than contemplated by the Lease and Massachusetts law.

47. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is neither de minimis nor sporadic; rather, it is serious, recurring, and has persisted over a substantial period of time. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102 (recognizing that repeated, severe interferences are actionable); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 283–84.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;

   b. Diminution in the rental value of the Premises during the period of interference;

   c. Emotional distress, sleep loss, anxiety, and related suffering;

   d. Employment‑related harm, including at least one written warning at work;

   e. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for medical treatment and sleep medication (approximately $40 per month) and mitigation purchases (earplugs, white noise machine);

   f. Other incidental and consequential damages reasonably flowing from Defendant’s breach.

49. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her actual damages at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200), exclusive of statutory multiple damages, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.

50. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. See Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Aguayo v. Donahue, 2012 Mass. App. Div. 113.

51. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek enhancement of her recovery consistent with G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law, including but not limited to an award equivalent to three times her monthly rent (three times $1,800) if that is greater than her actual and consequential damages, as provided by statute, along with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs should she later retain counsel.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Robert Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law of Massachusetts;

B. An award of actual and consequential damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, but presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200), together with statutory damages in accordance with G.L. c. 186, § 14, including, as applicable, an award of not less than three months’ rent if greater than actual damages;

C. An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and any other applicable law, including, if Plaintiff later secures counsel, such fees incurred from and after that time;

D. An award of prejudgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by G.L. c. 231, § 6B and other applicable law;

E. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper to remedy the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to orders directing Defendant to take reasonable steps to abate future disturbances.

---

### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
