It does not involve or discuss a complaint for modification, nor does it mention any requirement of showing a material and substantial change in circumstances since a prior judgment.

While it acknowledges considering the child\u2019s preference, school performance, and parental conduct, it does not set out or endorse a list including age, developmental needs, household stability, and scheduling needs for education, health, and emotional stability. Thus it only indirectly reflects best\u2011interests considerations and does not serve as authority for the full, specific multi\u2011factor standard claimed.",
