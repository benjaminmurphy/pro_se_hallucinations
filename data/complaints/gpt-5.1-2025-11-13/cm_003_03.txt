DOCKET NO.: ____________________  

JESSICA TAYLOR,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL BROWN,  
 Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Physical Custody / Parenting Time / Related Orders)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Brown, age 8.

2. The Defendant, Michael Brown (“Father”), is an individual believed to reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Brown.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody and parenting-time orders concerning the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10, 20; and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G.L. c. 209B, because Massachusetts is and has been the child’s “home state.”

4. On or about May 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment/Order (the “Existing Custody Order”) providing, among other things, that:
   a. The parties would share legal custody of the minor child; and  
   b. The child’s primary residence would be with Mother; and  
   c. Father would have parenting time with the child on designated weekends and as otherwise set forth in the Existing Custody Order.

5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the prior judgment was entered here and the minor child resides in Middlesex County. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 208, §§ 5, 28.

6. This Complaint seeks modification only of custody/parenting-time and related conditions, based upon a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests and safety of the minor child since entry of the Existing Custody Order. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. 546 (2009); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

### II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

7. Ethan Brown (“Ethan”) is 8 years old. At the time the Existing Custody Order was entered on May 15, 2021, Ethan was approximately 6 years old.

8. At the time of the Existing Custody Order, the Court found, or implicitly accepted, that:
   a. Both parents appeared stable and capable of safely caring for Ethan;  
   b. Both parents were capable of co‑parenting cooperatively; and  
   c. Regular overnight parenting time with Father was in Ethan’s best interests.

9. Under the Existing Custody Order, Mother has primary physical custody of Ethan, and Father exercises parenting time on certain weekends, which include overnight visits at Father’s residence.

10. Since entry of the Existing Custody Order, new and significant concerns have arisen regarding Father’s use of alcohol and/or other intoxicating substances during his parenting time with Ethan.

11. Over approximately the past several months, Ethan has reported to Mother that there are “special drinks” at Father’s home and that sometimes Father “can’t walk straight.”

12. Ethan’s statements have been spontaneous, repeated on multiple occasions, and consistent with each other, and they appear to describe Father’s intoxication while Ethan is in Father’s care.

13. The nature of these statements raises concerns that Father is consuming alcohol and/or other substances to the point of impairment while responsible for Ethan, particularly during overnight visits.

14. A neighbor who is familiar with the parties’ situation recently sent Mother a video depicting Father stumbling while getting Ethan out of a car late at night, during or immediately following Father’s parenting time.

15. In the video, Father appears unsteady on his feet and has difficulty walking in a straight line while Ethan is present and in his care.

16. The timing and circumstances depicted in the video are consistent with Ethan’s reports that Father sometimes “can’t walk straight,” and support a reasonable inference that Father was impaired while exercising parenting time.

17. Additionally, representatives of Ethan’s school have informed Mother that Ethan frequently appears extremely tired or exhausted on Monday mornings, following weekends spent with Father.

18. Ethan’s Monday‑morning exhaustion is a recurring pattern that was not present at the time of the Existing Custody Order and appears to correlate with weekends spent at Father’s home.

19. Ethan’s apparent fatigue suggests that he may not be receiving adequate sleep, structure, or supervision in Father’s care, and may be exposed to late‑night activities or instability, possibly related to Father’s substance use.

20. These developments—Ethan’s repeated statements, the neighbor’s video, and the school’s observations—have collectively given rise to serious, good‑faith concerns about Ethan’s safety and well‑being during Father’s overnight parenting time.

21. These concerns did not exist, and were not reasonably foreseeable, at the time the Existing Custody Order was entered.

22. Mother is genuinely and reasonably worried that Father’s apparent intoxication and instability when caring for Ethan, particularly overnight and in the late evening, create an unacceptable risk to Ethan’s physical safety and emotional welfare.

23. Mother’s concerns include, but are not limited to, the risk that:
   a. Father might drive a vehicle while impaired with Ethan as a passenger;  
   b. Father might be unable to adequately supervise Ethan, particularly at night;  
   c. Father might be unable to respond appropriately to emergencies or routine caregiving needs; and  
   d. Exposure to Father’s apparent intoxication may cause Ethan emotional distress and instability.

24. Mother has at all times endeavored to foster Ethan’s relationship with Father, has complied with the Existing Custody Order, and is not seeking to terminate Father’s relationship with Ethan, but rather to ensure that Ethan’s time with Father is safe, structured, and in Ethan’s best interests.

25. Mother seeks modification of the Existing Custody Order to impose appropriate safeguards and conditions on Father’s parenting time, and to adjust the custodial arrangement as necessary, so that Ethan is not exposed to unsafe conditions arising from Father’s apparent substance use or impairment.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

26. A custody or parenting‑time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order, and (2) that the requested modification is in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. 546, 550–551 (2009); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 180–182 (2006).

27. Massachusetts courts have long held that the paramount concern in custody matters is the best interests of the child. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–844 (2003); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

28. A parent’s substance abuse, intoxication, or impaired functioning while caring for a child can constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification where it affects the child’s safety, stability, or welfare. See, e.g., *Adoption of Katharine*, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 29–31 (1997) (parent’s substance abuse relevant to parental fitness and child’s welfare); *Adoption of Quentin*, 424 Mass. 882, 886–888 (1997).

29. Changes in a parent’s ability to provide a safe and stable home, including evidence of alcohol or drug misuse, are properly considered as material changes affecting the child’s best interests. See *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755, 766–767 (1983); *Care & Protection of Olga*, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 821, 825–827 (2003).

30. At the time of the Existing Custody Order on May 15, 2021, there was no evidence before the Court that Father was abusing alcohol or other substances, or that he was caring for Ethan while impaired.

31. Since that time, the combination of Ethan’s consistent statements about Father’s “special drinks” and inability to “walk straight,” the neighbor’s video showing Father stumbling while caring for Ethan late at night, and the school’s observations that Ethan is regularly exhausted following weekends with Father, collectively constitute new, significant facts that materially change the circumstances presumed by the Existing Custody Order.

32. These new facts directly implicate Ethan’s safety and emotional well‑being during Father’s overnight parenting time, which is central to any custody and parenting‑time analysis. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–596 (1996) (court must focus on whether living arrangements and parental conduct serve child’s best interests); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–844.

33. The risks presented by Father’s apparent intoxication and late‑night instability—particularly during overnights—were not contemplated by the Existing Custody Order and represent a substantial departure from the circumstances upon which that order was based.

34. The pattern of Ethan’s Monday‑morning exhaustion, as reported by his school, further demonstrates that Father’s home environment during parenting time may lack appropriate structure, rest, and supervision, and that the current parenting schedule may be detrimental to Ethan’s health and school functioning. See *B.B.V. v. B.N.V.*, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 12, 20–21 (2007) (child’s stability and adjustment to school and routine are important in best‑interests analysis).

35. This accumulation of new information amounts to a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting Ethan’s best interests and safety, satisfying the threshold requirement for modification under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law. See *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. at 550–551; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 180–182.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD AND NEED FOR MODIFICATION

36. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, in making or modifying custody and parenting‑time orders, the Court must consider “the happiness and welfare of the children” as the paramount concern.

37. The “best interests of the child” standard requires the Court to consider, among other things, the child’s safety, emotional and physical needs, stability of the home environment, and each parent’s capacity to meet those needs. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–844; *Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–596.

38. Massachusetts law recognizes that a child’s exposure to a parent’s substance abuse, unsafe behavior, or instability may undermine the child’s best interests, even in the absence of direct physical harm. See *Adoption of Katharine*, 42 Mass. App. Ct. at 29–31; *Adoption of Quentin*, 424 Mass. at 886–888; *Care & Protection of Olga*, 57 Mass. App. Ct. at 825–827.

39. Ensuring that parenting time occurs in a safe and sober environment is squarely within the Court’s authority when fashioning custody and parenting‑time orders. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649, 658–659 (2002) (court may place appropriate conditions on visitation to safeguard child’s welfare); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 493–495 (2012).

40. The evidence described above raises substantial and good‑faith concerns that Father may be caring for Ethan while impaired by alcohol and/or other substances, particularly during overnights, and that this conduct places Ethan at risk of harm and undermines his emotional and physical well‑being.

41. The current arrangement, which allows unsupervised overnight parenting time with Father, does not adequately address these safety concerns and is no longer consistent with Ethan’s best interests.

42. Modification of the Existing Custody Order to impose reasonable safety conditions—such as supervision, restrictions or monitoring of substance use, and/or adjustment or limitation of overnights—is necessary to protect Ethan’s welfare while reasonably preserving his relationship with Father in a safe manner.

43. Mother is not seeking to completely eliminate Father’s parenting time; rather, she seeks a modified order that:
   a. Provides appropriate safeguards to ensure that Father is sober and able to care for Ethan safely during parenting time;  
   b. Addresses Ethan’s chronic exhaustion following weekends with Father by adjusting the schedule or overnights; and  
   c. Clarifies expectations so that future parenting‑time arrangements support Ethan’s health, safety, and educational needs.

44. It is in Ethan’s best interests that his primary residence remain with Mother, who has been his primary caregiver, provides a stable home, and ensures that he is rested and prepared for school.

45. To the extent necessary, it is in Ethan’s best interests that the Court reaffirm or clarify Mother’s physical custody as primary, and, if appropriate, adjust legal custody, decision‑making, and/or conditions surrounding Father’s parenting time to safeguard Ethan’s well‑being.

46. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the material changes that have arisen since the Existing Custody Order and is consistent with Massachusetts law governing modification of custody and parenting‑time orders. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. at 550–551; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–844.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

47. In light of the material and substantial change in circumstances and the best interests of Ethan, Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the Existing Custody Order as follows:

   a. **Primary Physical Custody**  
      That the Court confirm and/or award primary physical custody of Ethan to Mother, with Ethan’s primary residence remaining with Mother.

   b. **Legal Custody (as appropriate)**  
      That the Court reaffirm, or upon further hearing modify if necessary, the parties’ legal custody arrangement in a manner that promotes Ethan’s best interests and safety, including consideration of whether sole legal custody to Mother is warranted if Father’s ability to make sound decisions regarding Ethan’s welfare is significantly impaired by substance use.

   c. **Parenting Time / Overnights**  
      That Father’s overnight parenting time be modified to protect Ethan’s safety and emotional welfare, which may include, as the Court deems appropriate after hearing:
      - Temporarily suspending Father’s unsupervised overnight parenting time; and/or  
      - Requiring that Father’s parenting time occur during daytime hours only, without overnights; and/or  
      - Reinstating overnights only upon Father’s demonstrated, sustained sobriety and stability, supported by appropriate safeguards (e.g., negative alcohol/drug screens, participation in treatment, or other conditions deemed appropriate by the Court).

   d. **Supervision / Conditions**  
      That, to the extent the Court finds it necessary and appropriate, Father’s parenting time be supervised by a mutually agreed‑upon supervisor, a professional visitation center, or other neutral third party approved by the Court, until it is determined that Ethan’s safety can be reasonably assured without supervision.

   e. **Substance‑Use‑Related Conditions**  
      That the Court impose reasonable conditions to ensure that Father is not impaired while with Ethan, such as:
      - A prohibition on Father’s use of alcohol or non‑prescribed controlled substances during parenting time and for a reasonable period (e.g., 24 hours) before parenting time;  
      - Random and/or scheduled alcohol or drug testing, with results made available to the Court and, as appropriate, to Mother;  
      - Participation in substance‑abuse evaluation and, if recommended, treatment or counseling.

   f. **Schedule Adjustments for Ethan’s Well‑Being**  
      That the Court adjust the parenting schedule as necessary to:
      - Ensure Ethan obtains adequate sleep and rest on nights preceding school days;  
      - Reduce or eliminate late‑night transitions or activities that contribute to Ethan’s Monday‑morning exhaustion.

   g. **Any Additional Orders Necessary**  
      That the Court enter such further orders as are necessary to protect Ethan’s health, safety, education, and emotional stability, and to implement the foregoing modifications in a clear and enforceable manner.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Custody Order dated May 15, 2021;

2. Find that modification of the Existing Custody Order is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Brown;

3. Enter a Modified Judgment/Order:
   a. Confirming Mother as Ethan’s primary physical custodian and primary residential parent;  
   b. Reaffirming or modifying legal custody, as the Court deems appropriate, in light of the evidence and Ethan’s best interests;  
   c. Modifying Father’s parenting time to impose appropriate safeguards, including changes to overnights, supervision, and/or conditions regarding substance use, as set forth above or as otherwise ordered by the Court;  
   d. Adjusting the parenting schedule as needed to address Ethan’s recurring exhaustion and to ensure he is adequately rested and prepared for school; and  
   e. Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.

4. Schedule this Complaint for Modification for a prompt Case Management Conference, Pre‑Trial Conference, and Evidentiary Hearing as appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,
