Although this case arises under c. 119 and c. 210 rather than c. 208, it clearly supports the general proposition that the paramount consideration in custody/placement decisions is the child\u2019s best interests.",

G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (c). The \u2018best interests of a child\u2019 is a question that presents the trial judge \u2018with a classic example of a discretionary decision.\u2019 \u2026 [I]n child custody cases the best interests standard mandated by G.
