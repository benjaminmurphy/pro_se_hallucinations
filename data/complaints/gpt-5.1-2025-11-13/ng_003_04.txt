v.

    Defendant.  
____________________________________/

                       COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE
                  AND DEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY


Plaintiff Michael Thompson (“Plaintiff”) brings this civil action against Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                             I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Michael Thompson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store is a business entity engaged in the operation of a retail discount home-goods store located at 123 Main Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851, in Middlesex County.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, occupied, operated, managed, and/or controlled the premises located at 123 Main Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851 (the “Premises”).

                       II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injuries arising out of Defendant’s negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is within the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Superior Court. See G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County, where the Premises are located and where Plaintiff was injured. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

                   III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a customer and business invitee, shopping for kitchen items in the store’s kitchenware section.

8. At that time and place, Defendant, acting through its employees, agents, and/or servants, had stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens and similar items, on shelving units in the aisle where Plaintiff was shopping.

9. The boxes were stacked approximately five to six units high on the shelves, without any straps, safety rails, barriers, netting, or other devices to secure them from falling into the aisle.

10. The boxes were stored in a manner such that they were susceptible to becoming unstable and falling into the customer walkway upon a reasonably foreseeable contact or jostling of the shelving.

11. While Plaintiff was lawfully standing in the aisle examining kitchen merchandise, another customer pushed a standard shopping cart down the same aisle and made a normal, incidental bump against a lower portion of the shelving unit.

12. The contact with the shelving was of the type and magnitude that occurs routinely in retail stores and should have been anticipated and guarded against by a reasonably prudent store operator.

13. As a result of the cart’s contact with the shelving, a heavy box containing a toaster oven, which had been stacked near the top of the shelving unit above Plaintiff’s head, became dislodged and fell.

14. The falling box struck Plaintiff on the right shoulder and the side of his head, causing immediate pain, dizziness, and a significant headache.

15. Store employees and the store manager responded to the incident. The manager filled out an incident report and offered Plaintiff a store coupon, but did not call emergency medical services.

16. Plaintiff left the store and returned home; as the evening progressed, his symptoms, including headache, dizziness, and discomfort in his shoulder, worsened.

17. Later that night, Plaintiff sought medical care at a hospital emergency department in Massachusetts.

18. At the emergency department, Plaintiff was evaluated and diagnosed with a mild concussion and a right shoulder strain.

19. Plaintiff was advised to rest, limit physical activity, and avoid tasks requiring concentration or exertion for a period of time.

20. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff worked as a delivery driver. Due to his concussion symptoms and shoulder injury, Plaintiff was unable to perform his usual work duties and was required to miss several days of work.

21. As a direct and proximate result of the incident and injuries, Plaintiff missed work and lost approximately $800 in wages.

22. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200 for evaluation and treatment relating to his concussion and shoulder strain.

23. In addition, Plaintiff was unable to participate in his regular weekly recreational soccer league for approximately one month, resulting in loss of enjoyment of life and interference with his ordinary activities.

24. The shelving configuration, method of stacking heavy boxes, absence of restraints, and failure to secure or otherwise render the boxes safe from falling created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to customers lawfully using the aisle.

25. Defendant, acting through its employees and management, knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the unsafe and unstable stacking of heavy merchandise above customer head level and the likelihood that a normal bump or jostling would cause boxes to fall.

26. Defendant failed to take reasonable measures to inspect, correct, or remedy the dangerous condition, including failing to:

   a. Properly secure or restrain heavy boxes on high shelves;  
   b. Limit the height of stacked heavy merchandise in customer aisles;  
   c. Provide safety bars, rails, or other barriers to prevent merchandise from falling;  
   d. Train employees adequately in safe stocking and merchandising practices; and  
   e. Warn customers of the danger of falling merchandise.

27. The injuries and damages suffered by Plaintiff were caused by the dangerous, defective, and unsafe condition created and/or allowed to persist by Defendant on its Premises.

28. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the creation of the dangerous condition and was using the Premises in a reasonably foreseeable and intended manner at the time of the incident.

29. Plaintiff has complied with all applicable statutes of limitation, including G.L. c. 260, § 2A, in commencing this action within three years of the date of injury.

30. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

                     IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                          NEGLIGENCE

31. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a business invitee on the Premises. As such, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect him from foreseeable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973).

33. Under Massachusetts law, owners and occupiers of land are subject to the general duty to act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances, including the duty to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 371–72 (2010).

34. Defendant, as the operator and controller of a retail store open to the public, owed Plaintiff a duty to:

   a. Use reasonable care in the stocking and placement of merchandise;  
   b. Avoid creating dangerous conditions likely to cause harm to customers;  
   c. Conduct reasonable inspections to discover unsafe conditions; and  
   d. Either remedy such unsafe conditions or warn customers of their existence.  
   See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 782–83 (2007).

35. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to protect him from harm arising from conditions that Defendant created or of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known. See Bowers v. P. Wile’s, Inc., 454 Mass. 361, 366–67 (2009).

36. Defendant, through its employees, created a dangerous condition by stacking heavy boxes of appliances at an excessive height above customer head level on shelves without adequate restraints or safety measures.

37. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that customers and shopping carts would come into incidental contact with shelving units and that such contact could cause unsecured heavy items stacked high above the aisle to fall and strike customers.

38. A reasonably prudent store operator in Defendant’s position would have taken steps to prevent heavy items from falling on customers, including limiting stack height, using safety rails or restraints, conducting regular safety inspections, and training employees on safe stocking practices. See Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162, 169 (1980) (reasonable care standard considers foreseeability of harm).

39. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:

   a. Failing to safely stock and secure heavy merchandise on high shelves;  
   b. Stacking boxes five or six units high in a customer aisle without restraints or barriers;  
   c. Failing to use safety rails, netting, or other devices to prevent boxes from falling;  
   d. Failing to conduct reasonable inspections of shelving and merchandise for stability;  
   e. Failing to correct, remedy, or mitigate an obviously hazardous merchandising practice;  
   f. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the risk of falling merchandise; and  
   g. Failing to adopt and enforce reasonable policies and employee training regarding safe stocking and merchandise display.

40. Under Massachusetts law, a store owner is liable when its negligence in maintaining or controlling its premises is a substantial contributing cause of a customer’s injury. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 785–86.

41. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of the box falling from the shelf and striking Plaintiff.

42. But for Defendant’s negligence, the heavy toaster-oven box would not have fallen, and Plaintiff would not have suffered a concussion, shoulder strain, and related damages. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (defining proximate cause).

43. Plaintiff was at all times acting with reasonable care for his own safety and did nothing to cause the box to fall.

44. To the extent that any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff denies that he was negligent in any respect. In any event, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged negligence by Plaintiff was less than the negligence of Defendant and does not bar recovery.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including but not limited to:

   a. Mild traumatic brain injury / concussion;  
   b. Shoulder strain; and  
   c. Headache, dizziness, pain, and associated symptoms.

46. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur medical expenses for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care reasonably related to his injuries. See G.L. c. 231, § 6D.

47. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses to date and reasonably anticipates that additional medical evaluation and/or treatment may be necessary.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff lost earnings in the approximate amount of $800 due to his inability to perform his job as a delivery driver for several days. See G.L. c. 231, § 60F (recognizing economic damages).

49. Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, including but not limited to being unable to participate in his regular weekly soccer league and other recreational activities for approximately one month, and experiencing ongoing discomfort and worry about his health. See Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 871–72 (1991) (recognizing pain and suffering damages).

50. Plaintiff is entitled to recover full and fair compensation for his economic and non-economic damages resulting from Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See G.L. c. 231, § 85K (general principles of tort recovery); see also doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 787–88 (1975) (scope of compensatory damages).

51. Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, managers, and agents under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).

52. Defendant’s conduct constitutes actionable negligence under Massachusetts common law, and Plaintiff has suffered damages cognizable under Massachusetts negligence law. See Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000); Prosser & Keeton, The Law of Torts § 30 (5th ed.).

                     V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Michael Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim of negligence;

B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the jury, together with statutory prejudgment and postjudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C. Award Plaintiff costs of this action as allowed by law, including filing fees and other taxable costs pursuant to G.L. c. 261;

D. Award such further and additional relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                   VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.

                                      Respectfully submitted,

                                      PLAINTIFF,
                                      MICHAEL THOMPSON,
                                      Pro Se
