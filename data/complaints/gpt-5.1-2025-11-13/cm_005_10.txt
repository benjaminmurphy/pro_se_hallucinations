COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BRISTOL COUNTY DIVISION  

------------------------------------------------------  
Jessica Thompson,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                          
                                                   Docket No.: __________

Michael Thompson,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Defendant” or “Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emma Thompson (date of birth: __________, age 10) and Noah Thompson (date of birth: __________, age 8) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Thompson, upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time concerning the Children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 215, § 6, and applicable case law.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

4. On or about May 10, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment/Order regarding legal custody, physical custody (residential schedule), and parenting time for the Children (the “2022 Custody Order”).

5. Under the 2022 Custody Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Children. The Order further provides that the Children primarily reside with the Plaintiff, and that the Defendant has parenting time with the Children on a regular schedule.

6. The 2022 Custody Order also requires that both parents support the Children’s relationship with the other parent, cooperate in parenting decisions, and refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the Children.

7. The 2022 Custody Order was based upon the circumstances and best interests of the Children as they existed at or before May 10, 2022.

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. The Bristol County Probate and Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 215, § 6, and, to the extent applicable, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as this matter concerns custody and parenting time of minor children of parents subject to this Court’s prior orders.

9. Venue is proper in Bristol County because the prior judgment was entered in this Court and the Children reside in this county. See Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 4.1; G.L. c. 215, § 6.

### IV. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2022 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children and the parents’ ability to exercise shared legal custody and the existing parenting schedule.

11. Specifically, over the past year the Defendant has repeatedly and unilaterally enrolled the Children in extracurricular, social, or other activities that occur during the Plaintiff’s regularly scheduled parenting time, without first discussing those activities with the Plaintiff and without seeking her agreement or meaningful input.

12. The Defendant has then told the Children that if they are unable to attend those activities while in the Plaintiff’s care, it is “their mother’s fault,” thereby placing blame on the Plaintiff and creating conflict and confusion for the Children.

13. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that the Defendant has described the Plaintiff as “selfish” and has told them that the Plaintiff “doesn’t really love them” when she seeks to adjust or swap weekends to accommodate family needs or events, or when she raises concerns about scheduling and communication.

14. These disparaging comments and blame-shifting directly contradict the provisions of the 2022 Custody Order requiring both parents to support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and to avoid disparaging the other parent in the presence of the Children.

15. As a result of the Defendant’s conduct, one of the Children has begun experiencing frequent stomach aches and increased anxiety on transition days between households, which the Plaintiff reasonably believes is related to the conflict and emotional pressure the Children are experiencing.

16. The Defendant’s pattern of unilaterally scheduling activities during the Plaintiff’s time, combined with disparaging remarks and attributing blame to the Plaintiff, has significantly impaired the parents’ ability to cooperate in shared legal decision-making and has had a negative emotional impact on the Children.

17. The totality of these circumstances differs materially from the circumstances existing at the time of the 2022 Custody Order, and they materially affect the welfare and best interests of the Children.

18. Under Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” and a determination that modification is in the best interests of the children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Hersey v. Hersey, 271 Mass. 545 (1930).

19. The breakdown in cooperative decision-making, the ongoing interference with the Plaintiff’s parenting time through unilateral scheduling, and the emotional harm to the Children arising from disparagement and loyalty conflicts together constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the 2022 Custody Order.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

20. The paramount consideration in any custody determination is the best interests of the children. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Adoption of Vito, 431 Mass. 550 (2000).

21. The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that stability, continuity of care, and a parent’s willingness and ability to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent are key factors in assessing the child’s best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

22. The Plaintiff has been, and continues to be, the Children’s primary residential parent. The Children have lived primarily with the Plaintiff pursuant to the 2022 Custody Order, and she has provided consistent daily care, structure, and emotional support.

23. The Plaintiff has supported and continues to support the Children’s relationship with the Defendant, encourages their time with him, and seeks a parenting arrangement that reduces conflict and provides clear expectations so the Children are not placed in the middle of parental disagreements.

24. The Defendant’s repeated disparaging comments about the Plaintiff to the Children and his practice of blaming the Plaintiff for missed activities, particularly where those activities are scheduled unilaterally during the Plaintiff’s time, undermine the Children’s secure relationship with the Plaintiff and expose them to adult conflict, contrary to their best interests. See Signorelli v. Albano, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 939 (1985) (hostility and interference with relationship relevant to custody); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

25. Massachusetts courts have held that persistent interference with a child’s relationship with the other parent, or behavior that places the child in the middle of conflict and loyalty tensions, may warrant modification of custody. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 595 (1981).

26. The Children’s reported stomach aches and anxiety on transition days strongly suggest that the current level of conflict and the Defendant’s disparagement are causing emotional stress and distress for the Children, which is inconsistent with their well-being and best interests.

27. Because the Children already primarily reside with the Plaintiff, clarifying and confirming that they shall continue to live primarily with the Plaintiff, combined with clearer and more specific provisions regarding decision-making and scheduling of activities, will better promote their stability, reduce conflict, and serve their best interests.

28. The requested modifications do not seek to eliminate or unreasonably restrict the Defendant’s parenting time, but rather to ensure that parenting time and decision-making occur in a manner that is child-focused, cooperative, and consistent with the Children’s emotional and physical health.

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

29. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court “may from time to time, upon a complaint after a divorce, revise and alter its judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the children. See also Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

30. The same principles apply to modifications of prior custody orders regardless of whether the original proceeding was a divorce, separation, or related custody action, as the Probate and Family Court has broad equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); Bouchard v. DeGagne, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 100 (2016).

31. In assessing whether joint legal custody remains appropriate, the Court considers the parents’ ability to communicate and cooperate regarding major decisions affecting the children. Where the level of conflict or lack of cooperation undermines effective shared decision-making, modification is appropriate. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); M.P. v. C.P., 87 Mass. App. Ct. 462 (2015).

32. Massachusetts appellate courts have made clear that a parent’s willingness and ability to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent is a critical factor in custody determinations. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

33. The Defendant’s actions, as described, show a pattern of:
   a. Unilaterally making scheduling and activity decisions that directly interfere with the Plaintiff’s parenting time;  
   b. Disparaging the Plaintiff in front of the Children; and  
   c. Blaming the Plaintiff in a manner that pressures the Children and contributes to anxiety and physical complaints.

34. This pattern demonstrates a breakdown in the ability to exercise joint legal custody in a cooperative manner and interferes with the Plaintiff’s relationship with the Children, constituting a material and substantial change in circumstances under G.L. c. 208, § 28, justifying modification of legal and physical custody and the parenting plan.

35. The requested modification is also consistent with the factors enumerated in G.L. c. 208, § 31, including: the past and present living arrangements of the Children; the relationship of the Children with each parent; each parent’s willingness to encourage a positive relationship with the other parent; and the Children’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs.

36. To protect the Children from further exposure to conflict and disparagement, to support their relationship with each parent in a healthy way, and to provide stability and clarity in decision-making, the Court should revise and clarify the existing custody and parenting-time provisions of the 2022 Custody Order.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

37. The Plaintiff requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2022 Custody Order and that modification is in the best interests of the Children.

38. The Plaintiff requests that the Court enter an amended order including, inter alia, the following terms (wording and structure subject to the Court’s discretion):

   a. **Primary Residential Custody.** The Children shall continue to reside primarily with the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, who shall be designated as the primary residential parent for school enrollment and similar purposes.

   b. **Legal Custody.**  
      i. The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody conditioned on their ability to communicate and cooperate in the Children’s best interests; or, in the alternative, if the Court finds that effective joint legal custody is no longer workable due to the level of conflict and lack of cooperation, sole legal custody shall be awarded to the Plaintiff, without prejudice to the Defendant’s right to access information from schools, medical providers, and other professionals consistent with applicable law.  
      (The Plaintiff asks the Court to choose the option that best protects the Children after hearing.)

   c. **Parenting Time Schedule.** The Defendant shall have parenting time according to a regular, defined schedule that the Court deems appropriate, which may include alternating weekends and such weekday or holiday time as the Court orders, clearly specifying the start and end times of transitions so as to reduce conflict and confusion.

   d. **Activity Scheduling and Extracurriculars.** No parent shall unilaterally enroll the Children in any recurring extracurricular, athletic, or social activity that occurs during the other parent’s regularly scheduled parenting time without first providing reasonable notice to, and obtaining the agreement of, the other parent, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the absence of agreement or further order of the Court, each parent’s scheduled parenting time shall have priority over newly added activities.

   e. **Communication and Decision-Making.** The parties shall communicate regarding the Children’s major decisions (including education, non-routine medical care, and significant extracurricular commitments) through a mutually agreed written method (such as email or a parenting communication application), to reduce conflict and provide a clear record of notices and agreements.

   f. **Non-Disparagement.** Each parent shall refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence or hearing of the Children, and shall not make statements to the Children that blame the other parent for reasonable parenting decisions, nor attempt to enlist the Children in adult disputes.

   g. **Support of Parent–Child Relationships.** Each parent shall affirmatively support the Children’s relationship with the other parent and shall not interfere with or undermine that relationship, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and applicable case law.

   h. **Health and Emotional Well-Being.** The parties shall cooperate to address any ongoing physical symptoms or emotional distress experienced by the Children (including but not limited to stomach aches and anxiety around transitions), and shall ensure that the Children have access to appropriate medical or therapeutic support if recommended by their pediatrician or a qualified mental health professional.

   i. **Further Orders as Necessary.** The Court may issue such further and additional orders as are just and proper to protect the Children’s best interests and to implement these modifications.

### VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2022 Custody Order concerning the Children, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law;

2. Find that modification of custody and parenting time is in the Children’s best interests;

3. Enter an order confirming that the Children shall reside primarily with the Plaintiff as their primary residential parent;

4. Modify the existing legal custody provisions, either (a) continuing joint legal custody conditioned upon compliance with specific communication and cooperation requirements, or (b) awarding the Plaintiff sole legal custody if the Court finds that joint legal custody is no longer in the Children’s best interests;

5. Establish a clear and specific parenting time schedule for the Defendant that minimizes conflict and ambiguity;

6. Enter detailed provisions governing scheduling of activities and extracurriculars, such that neither parent may unilaterally schedule recurring activities during the other parent’s time without agreement, and that the Children are not placed in the middle or blamed for matters outside their control;

7. Enter non-disparagement and cooperation provisions as outlined above, requiring each parent to foster and encourage the Children’s relationship with the other parent;

8. Order that the parties cooperate in addressing any emotional or physical symptoms the Children experience related to parental conflict or transitions, as recommended by qualified professionals;

9. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the Children’s best interests.

Respectfully submitted,  

Jessica Thompson  
Plaintiff, pro se
