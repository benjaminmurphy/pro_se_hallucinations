Defendant.  

____________________________________/

### COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)


Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Richards (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Her contact information for purposes of this action is:  
   Telephone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Thomas Richards is an individual residing at, and at all relevant times was the owner and person in control of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201 (“the Property”).

3. At all times material hereto, Defendant owned, controlled, managed, and/or maintained the Property, including the yard and trees adjacent to and overhanging the public sidewalk in front of the Property.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of bodily injuries sustained by Plaintiff on July 15, 2023, in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore falls within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Berkshire County because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and the Property is located in Berkshire County. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 3; G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. The Property, 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, is a residential home with a large, mature maple tree located in the front yard adjacent to the public sidewalk.

8. For a significant period of time prior to July 15, 2023, one of the major branches of this maple tree extended over and above the public sidewalk area used by pedestrians.

9. For a substantial time before the incident, that major branch appeared visibly cracked, drooping, and compromised, such that an ordinarily prudent person would recognize it as hazardous and at risk of failure.

10. Plaintiff frequently walked along this residential street and regularly passed by the Property and that maple tree as a pedestrian.

11. On multiple prior occasions, Plaintiff personally observed that the branch overhanging the sidewalk looked cracked, drooping, and unsafe.

12. Neighbors of the Property, who also were familiar with the condition of the tree, expressed concern that the branch posed a danger to pedestrians using the sidewalk.

13. Upon information and belief, prior to July 15, 2023, at least one or more of these neighbors communicated their concerns directly to Defendant, informed him that the branch appeared dangerous, and suggested that he have the tree and the branch inspected and/or removed by a qualified arborist.

14. Upon information and belief, Defendant acknowledged the existence of the problem and told at least one neighbor that he would “deal with it in the spring,” indicating his awareness of the condition and his intention to address it.

15. Despite this acknowledged awareness and the concerns raised, Defendant failed to retain an arborist, tree service, or other qualified professional to inspect, trim, brace, or remove the cracked and drooping branch.

16. Defendant failed to take any reasonable steps to warn pedestrians or others of the hazardous condition of the branch, such as posting warnings, temporarily blocking the sidewalk area beneath the branch, or reporting the hazardous condition to the City of Pittsfield.

17. Defendant’s failure to remedy or warn of the hazardous branch continued for a substantial time, during which the branch remained cracked, drooping, and progressively more dangerous.

18. On or about July 15, 2023, during the summer, the Pittsfield area experienced a typical seasonal thunderstorm with rainfall and wind, but nothing out of the ordinary for that time of year: there were no tornado warnings, no extraordinary wind events, and no extreme or unforeseeable weather conditions.

19. At approximately that date and time, Plaintiff was lawfully walking as a pedestrian along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, carrying grocery bags, and exercising due care for her own safety.

20. As Plaintiff passed directly under the overhanging cracked branch of Defendant’s maple tree, the branch suddenly snapped and fell, striking Plaintiff on her shoulder and back and forcefully knocking her to the ground.

21. The falling branch struck Plaintiff with substantial force, causing immediate pain, shock, and physical injury.

22. Emergency evaluation and subsequent medical care revealed that Plaintiff sustained, among other injuries, a shoulder strain and multiple bruises to her body as a direct and proximate result of being struck by the fallen branch.

23. Plaintiff’s injuries required medical evaluation and treatment, including but not limited to doctor visits and related diagnostic and therapeutic care.

24. Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses as a direct result of the injuries caused by the falling branch.

25. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed in a retail job and, due to her injuries, pain, and physical limitations, she was unable to work for approximately one week.

26. As a direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff lost approximately $600 in wages.

27. In addition to her economic losses, Plaintiff experienced and continues to experience pain, suffering, discomfort, and emotional distress associated with the incident and her injuries.

28. Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, wage loss, and other harms were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the unsafe and neglected condition of the cracked, drooping branch overhanging the sidewalk.

29. The ordinary seasonal storm on or about July 15, 2023, did not constitute an unforeseeable “act of God” but was the sort of routine weather that a reasonably prudent homeowner in Massachusetts should anticipate and take into account when maintaining large trees in close proximity to public walkways.

30. A reasonably prudent property owner, aware of an obviously cracked and drooping limb over a public sidewalk – and specifically warned by neighbors of its dangerous condition – would have taken steps to make the condition safe or warn others before such a limb could fall and injure a pedestrian.

31. Defendant’s failure to act to remedy, inspect, secure, or remove the hazardous branch, or to warn of the danger presented by the branch, was unreasonable and fell below the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent homeowner under Massachusetts law.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

32. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–31 as if fully set forth herein.

### Duty

33. Under Massachusetts common law, a landowner or person in control of real property owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to conditions on the premises. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (abolishing common law distinction between invitees and licensees and establishing a duty of reasonable care owed by property owners to all lawful visitors).

34. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of the Property at 123 Maple Street, owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff, a foreseeable pedestrian using the adjacent public sidewalk, to avoid subjecting her to an unreasonable risk of harm from dangerous conditions arising from the Property, including unsafe trees and branches extending over the sidewalk. See *Souza v. Beacon Hill Civic Ass’n*, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 574, 577–78 (2009) (recognizing duty of landowners with respect to conditions that create risks to users of adjacent public ways); *Robbins v. Atkins*, 413 Mass. 436, 437–38 (1992).

35. Defendant’s duty of reasonable care included, without limitation, the obligations to:

   a. Conduct reasonable inspections or observations of the Property, including trees and branches obviously overhanging public ways;  
   b. Recognize and address visibly defective, cracked, drooping, or otherwise dangerous tree branches that posed a foreseeable risk to pedestrians;  
   c. Take reasonable steps to repair, trim, secure, or remove hazardous branches;  
   d. Retain qualified professionals, such as arborists, when a reasonable person would do so in light of the observable condition; and/or  
   e. Warn foreseeable users of the sidewalk of known or reasonably knowable dangers.

36. This duty is consistent with G.L. c. 231, § 85, which provides that negligence in Massachusetts is determined according to what a reasonably prudent person would do under like circumstances.

### Breach

37. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other things:

   a. Failing to inspect adequately or properly monitor the condition of the large maple tree and its overhanging branches;  
   b. Failing to take action after the branch became obviously cracked, drooping, and dangerous;  
   c. Failing to act after he was informed by neighbors that the branch was hazardous and should be evaluated by an arborist;  
   d. Failing to retain a qualified arborist or tree service to inspect, trim, brace, or remove the dangerous branch;  
   e. Failing to remove, reduce, or adequately secure the hazardous branch prior to the foreseeable occurrence of ordinary summer storms; and  
   f. Failing to warn pedestrians, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition of the branch that overhung the sidewalk.

38. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner may be held liable where he knows or reasonably should know that a condition on his property creates a risk of harm to persons outside the premises and fails to take reasonable precautions. See *Prosser v. Commonwealth*, 398 Mass. 152, 155–56 (1986) (recognizing duty to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to persons using adjacent property or ways); *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 731–32 (2000).

39. The cracked, drooping branch overhanging the sidewalk was an open and obvious defect which, in light of its location directly above an area used by pedestrians, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm if not corrected. See *Godsoe v. Chicopee*, 335 Mass. 210, 212–13 (1957) (discussing duty to correct or warn of dangerous conditions where harm is foreseeable).

40. Defendant’s continued delay and failure to “deal with it” despite knowledge of the condition, and despite the likelihood of continued ordinary storms, was unreasonable and below the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent homeowner in Massachusetts.

41. To the extent Defendant may assert that the storm on July 15, 2023, constituted an “act of God,” such a defense is unavailable where the injury-producing harm results from a combination of natural forces and the defendant’s own negligence, or where ordinary weather is foreseeable. See *Dennis v. City of Boston*, 320 Mass. 48, 50–51 (1946) (act of God defense limited and does not excuse failure to exercise due care against foreseeable natural conditions).

### Causation

42. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.

43. But for Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, or remove the obviously hazardous branch, or to employ an arborist or other professional, the branch would not have fallen onto Plaintiff, and Plaintiff would not have suffered the injuries described herein.

44. The type of harm Plaintiff suffered—being struck by a falling tree branch from a visibly defective limb over a sidewalk during an ordinary storm—is precisely the kind of harm that makes Defendant’s inaction negligent and was entirely foreseeable. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–49 (2006) (foreseeability of risk is central to duty and proximate cause analysis).

45. Massachusetts law recognizes that a negligent defendant is liable for all harm that is reasonably foreseeable, even if the precise manner in which the harm occurs is not predicted in detail. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640–41 (1996).

### Damages

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, causing physical pain, limitations, and discomfort.

47. Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,500 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for treatment of her injuries. See *Peck v. Public Serv. Co. of N.H.*, 428 Mass. 727, 730 (1999) (recognizing recovery of reasonable medical expenses caused by negligence).

48. Plaintiff lost approximately $600 in wages due to her inability to work for about one week after the injury. See *Griffin v. Gen. Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362, 366 (1980) (lost earnings are recoverable as damages in negligence actions).

49. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer conscious pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress associated with her injuries and the incident. See *Kosters v. Seven-Up Co.*, 595 F.2d 347, 352–53 (6th Cir. 1979) (applying Massachusetts law) (pain and suffering as compensable element of damages); see also *McDonald v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 322 Mass. 581, 586 (1948).

50. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for her past and future pain and suffering, past and future medical expenses, past wage loss, and any future loss of earning capacity reasonably proven to flow from the incident, as well as any other compensable losses recognized under Massachusetts law. See *Harlow v. Chin*, 405 Mass. 697, 702–03 (1989).

51. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on any judgment for personal injuries at the statutory rate from the date of commencement of this action.

52. To the extent the doctrine of comparative negligence under G.L. c. 231, § 85 is implicated, Plaintiff alleges that she was at all times exercising reasonable care for her own safety, that she was lawfully using the sidewalk, and that any comparative negligence attributable to her is less than any negligence attributable to Defendant.

53. Even if Plaintiff were found to have been negligent in some degree (which she denies), her negligence would not have been greater than the negligence of Defendant, and therefore would not bar recovery under G.L. c. 231, § 85.
