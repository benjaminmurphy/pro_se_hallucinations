     Plaintiff,  

v.                                            Civil Action No. ___________

BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER,  
     Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
                     COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff James Miller (“Plaintiff”), as parent and next friend of his minor son, J.M., brings this Complaint against Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff James Miller is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is the father and legal guardian of J.M., a minor child, and brings this action on behalf of his minor son and on his own behalf for medical expenses and related losses.

2. J.M. is an eight-year-old minor child who, at all relevant times, was enrolled in and attended the after‑school program operated by Defendant at 1234 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.

3. Defendant Brockton Community Center is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts entity (whether organized as a nonprofit corporation or otherwise) with a principal place of business at 1234 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, which owns, operates, and/or controls an after‑school program and gym facility at that address.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its officers, employees, agents, and/or servants, held itself out to the public as providing a safe, supervised after‑school program for children, including gym activities that would be supervised by staff at all times.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.

6. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and Defendant transacts business and operates its facility there.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Defendant operates an after‑school program at its community center located at 1234 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, which includes use of a gymnasium for children’s recreational activities.

8. Defendant advertises and represents to parents and guardians that children participating in its after‑school program will be supervised at all times while in the gym, including during physical and athletic activities.

9. On or about September 15, 2023, J.M., then eight years old and small for his age, was attending Defendant’s after‑school program and was present in Defendant’s gymnasium as part of the program activities.

10. On that date, approximately twenty children were present in the gym and, pursuant to Defendant’s own policies and/or standard practices, there were supposed to be at least two staff members supervising the children during gym time.

11. At some point during the gym session, one of the two staff members left the gym and went to an office to perform paperwork, leaving only one staff member physically present in the gym to supervise the approximately twenty children.

12. The remaining staff member was positioned near the bleachers and, instead of actively supervising the children, was largely focused on and looking at her cell phone.

13. While supervision was inadequate and inattentive, two older boys, approximately twelve years old and significantly larger than J.M., began to engage in rough, tackle‑style play on the hardwood gym floor.

14. The rough tackle play was plainly visible and audible, was occurring in open view, and posed an obvious and foreseeable risk of serious injury to younger and smaller children in the gym, including J.M.

15. Other children observed the dangerous behavior of the two older boys and complained to the supervising staff member, informing her that the boys were playing roughly and tackling on the gym floor.

16. The supervising staff member responded dismissively and negligently, stating “boys will be boys,” and failed to intervene, separate the children, stop the tackle play, or implement any safety rules or alternative activities.

17. Defendant’s staff failed to enforce reasonable safety rules in the gym, failed to separate older and physically larger children from smaller and more vulnerable children during rough play, and failed to provide active supervision proportionate to the age, number, and behavior of the children present.

18. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to supervise and failure to stop the rough tackle play, one of the older, larger boys tackled J.M. forcefully on the hardwood floor.

19. J.M. was slammed to the ground, struck his head on the hard gym floor, and lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

20. Emergency services were summoned and/or J.M. was promptly transported to the emergency room, where he was evaluated and diagnosed with a concussion.

21. As a result of the concussion, J.M. experienced head pain, dizziness, confusion, and other symptoms consistent with a traumatic brain injury, and he missed several days of school following the incident.

22. The concussion and associated symptoms interfered with J.M.’s normal daily activities, caused him pain and suffering, and created anxiety and distress for both J.M. and Plaintiff.

23. Defendant’s negligent supervision and failure to enforce safe practices in the gym caused J.M.’s injuries and were a substantial contributing factor in those injuries.

24. Plaintiff, as J.M.’s parent, incurred medical expenses on behalf of his son as a result of the concussion and related treatment in an amount presently estimated at approximately Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).

25. Plaintiff also lost wages in an amount presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) because he was required to take time off from work to care for J.M. and attend medical appointments following the incident.

26. Additional medical expenses, future care, or educational accommodations may reasonably be expected as a result of the concussion, and Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to proof of such damages.

27. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its employees and agents, owed J.M., as a child lawfully on the premises and enrolled in its program, a duty to exercise reasonable care for his safety, including a heightened duty of care appropriate to the supervision of young children in physical activities.

28. Defendant breached that duty of reasonable care by failing to provide adequate staffing, failing to actively supervise the children, ignoring complaints and warnings from other children, and allowing dangerous tackle play to continue on a hard gym floor.

29. Plaintiff and J.M. were free from contributory negligence of any kind; as an eight‑year‑old child, J.M. was entitled to rely upon Defendant’s promised and reasonably expected supervision and safety measures.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE (ON BEHALF OF MINOR CHILD, J.M.)

30. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or operator that invites children onto its premises for a supervised program owes those children a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation and supervision of activities on the premises. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (establishing general duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors); Thorson v. Mandell, 402 Mass. 744, 747–48 (1988) (landowner must act as a reasonable person in maintaining premises).

32. The standard of care applicable to Defendant includes the obligation to provide adequate supervision of children engaged in physical activities, to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm from rough or dangerous play, and to act as a reasonably prudent operator of a youth recreation program under like circumstances. See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 54–57 (1983) (duty to protect where harm is foreseeable and relationship gives rise to obligation to take reasonable precautions); Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244, 246–47 (1982) (duty where harm to child is foreseeable).

33. Under the established elements of negligence articulated in Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006), and Restatement (Second) of Torts § 281, Plaintiff must show: (a) a duty of reasonable care owed by Defendant to J.M.; (b) a breach of that duty; (c) a causal connection between the breach and the injury; and (d) actual damages. Each of these elements is satisfied in this case.

34. Defendant owed J.M., an eight‑year‑old child enrolled in its after‑school program, a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising gym activities, including a duty to (a) provide a sufficient number of attentive staff; (b) monitor children’s behavior; (c) respond appropriately to reports of dangerous conduct; and (d) prevent older and physically larger children from engaging in tackle‑style play on a hard gym floor in proximity to smaller children.

35. Defendant undertook and assumed the responsibility to supervise children in the gym by offering a structured, supervised after‑school program and expressly representing that children would be supervised at all times during gym activities, thereby reinforcing its legal duty. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 54–55 (duty may arise from voluntary assumption of responsibility and representations made to those relying on the provider).

36. Defendant breached its duty of care to J.M. in one or more of the following respects, each of which independently and collectively constitutes negligence:

   a. Failing to maintain the required and/or a reasonably sufficient number of staff members in the gym while approximately twenty children were present;

   b. Allowing one of the two staff members to leave the gym to perform paperwork, leaving only a single supervisor for approximately twenty children engaged in athletic activity;

   c. Failing to ensure that the remaining supervisor provided active, continuous, and attentive supervision, and instead permitting her to remain near the bleachers and pay primary attention to her cell phone;

   d. Failing to implement or enforce reasonable rules prohibiting tackle‑style or rough play on the hard gym floor;

   e. Failing to respond to and act upon specific warnings from children that older boys were playing too roughly and engaging in tackle play;

   f. Failing to separate older, larger children from younger, smaller children when roughhousing behavior began;

   g. Failing to stop the dangerous tackle game after it became, or reasonably should have become, apparent that such conduct posed a serious risk of harm; and

   h. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent operator of a children’s after‑school program and gym facility under the same or similar circumstances.

37. The risk that unsupervised or inadequately supervised tackle‑style play between older and younger children on a hardwood gym floor would result in head injury or concussion to a smaller child, such as J.M., was reasonably foreseeable. See Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc., 355 Mass. 450, 454–55 (1969) (foreseeability of harm central to duty and breach); Afarian v. Massachusetts Elec. Co., 449 Mass. 257, 262–63 (2007) (foreseeability guides scope of duty and breach analysis).

38. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of J.M.’s concussion and related injuries. But for Defendant’s breaches of its duty of care, including its failure to stop the tackle play upon being notified, J.M. would not have been tackled to the floor and would not have sustained a head injury. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 146–47 (causation standard); Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (causation is satisfied where defendant’s conduct was a substantial contributing factor in producing harm).

39. Defendant’s negligence resulted in actual, compensable damages to J.M., including but not limited to:

   a. Physical injury in the form of a concussion and associated symptoms;

   b. Pain, suffering, and discomfort at the time of injury and thereafter;

   c. Emotional distress, fear, and anxiety related to the incident and its aftermath;

   d. Interference with his ability to attend school and participate in normal activities for several days;

   e. Risk of future complications or ongoing cognitive or emotional effects from the concussion.

40. Massachusetts law recognizes the right of a minor child to recover for personal injuries caused by the negligence of another, including pain and suffering. See G.L. c. 231, § 6D (governing recovery for pain and suffering in negligence actions involving bodily injury); see also Brune v. Belinkoff, 354 Mass. 102, 109–10 (1968) (adopting reasonable care standard in negligence actions); Flood v. Southland Corp., 416 Mass. 62, 71–72 (1993) (landowner and business operator’s duty to exercise reasonable care to protect patrons from foreseeable harm).

41. Plaintiff brings this claim as parent and next friend of J.M. pursuant to applicable Massachusetts law permitting parents and guardians to sue on behalf of minors. See, e.g., G.L. c. 230, § 5 (actions by or on behalf of minors and persons under disability); Mass. R. Civ. P. 17(b) & (c) (capacity of representative parties).

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.M. has suffered and continues to suffer damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

### COUNT II – NEGLIGENCE (PARENTAL CLAIM FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES AND RELATED LOSSES)

43. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 42 as if fully set forth herein.

44. Under Massachusetts law, a parent has an independent cause of action to recover medical expenses and other pecuniary losses incurred on behalf of an injured minor child as a result of a defendant’s negligence. See G.L. c. 231, § 85K (preserving negligence claims against certain charitable organizations subject to limitations); G.L. c. 233, § 20B (recognizing parent‑child relationship in context of medical testimony); see also Diaz v. Eli Lilly & Co., 364 Mass. 153, 167–68 (1973) (recognizing independent claims related to injuries within the family context, by analogy).

45. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred and is liable for reasonable and necessary medical expenses for the diagnosis and treatment of J.M.’s concussion and related injuries, in an amount presently estimated at approximately Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), subject to amendment as additional expenses are incurred or discovered.

46. As a further direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered lost wages in an amount presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00) because he was required to miss work in order to care for J.M., transport him to and from medical appointments, and monitor his recovery after the concussion.

47. Plaintiff may incur additional medical bills, therapy expenses, or related costs for J.M.’s care in the future, all of which are reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent conduct.

48. Plaintiff is entitled to recover these economic losses from Defendant as part of his independent negligence claim as J.M.’s parent and legal guardian.

### APPLICABLE STATUTORY AND COMMON‑LAW PRINCIPLES

49. This action is brought under the common law of negligence of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as informed and supplemented by:

   a. G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence; not applicable here because J.M. is eight years old and not contributorily negligent, but confirming the general framework);

   b. G.L. c. 231, § 6D (allowing recovery for pain and suffering in negligence actions upon proof of bodily injury);

   c. G.L. c. 231, §§ 85K and 85L (addressing negligence actions and, where applicable, claims against charitable organizations and associated standards of care and liability limitations);

   d. G.L. c. 260, § 2A (three‑year statute of limitations for personal injury actions, which this action meets, as it is filed within three years of the September 15, 2023 incident).

50. The duty and standard of care, as applied to these facts, are shaped by established Massachusetts precedents, including but not limited to:

   a. Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing rigid common‑law distinctions among lawful entrants and imposing a general duty of reasonable care);

   b. Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (duty to protect students where harm is foreseeable, recognizing a duty arising from the nature of the relationship and voluntary assumption of safety responsibilities);

   c. Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (defining negligence elements and emphasizing foreseeability);

   d. Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244 (1982) (duty to protect where conduct creates foreseeable risk to children);

   e. Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc., 355 Mass. 450 (1969) (duty of premises operators to protect patrons from reasonably foreseeable harm);

   f. Flood v. Southland Corp., 416 Mass. 62 (1993) (scope of duty to invitees and patrons on business premises);

   g. Afarian v. Massachusetts Elec. Co., 449 Mass. 257 (2007) (foreseeability and scope of duty);

   h. Brune v. Belinkoff, 354 Mass. 102 (1968) (reasonable care standard in negligence actions);

   i. Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., 399 Mass. 790 (1987) (causation and substantial contributing factor standard).

51. Under these statutes and cases, Defendant owed and breached a duty of reasonable care to J.M. and to Plaintiff, and Defendant is liable for the full extent of the damages legally and proximately caused by its negligence.

### DAMAGES

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.M. and Plaintiff have sustained damages, including but not limited to:

   a. For J.M.:

      i. Physical pain and suffering associated with the concussion and related symptoms;

      ii. Emotional distress, anxiety, and fear related to the incident and resulting medical treatment;

      iii. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with usual activities, including missing several days of school and normal childhood activities;

      iv. The risk of future complications from the concussion, to the extent proven at trial.

      i. Past medical expenses for emergency room care, diagnostic testing, follow‑up visits, and any related treatment for J.M., presently estimated at approximately $5,000.00, subject to proof at trial;

      ii. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00 for time taken off work to care for J.M. and attend medical appointments;

      iii. Future medical or related expenses for J.M.’s care, if any, to the extent reasonably certain and proven at trial.

53. Plaintiff is entitled to recover interest on any judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B (pre‑judgment interest in personal injury actions) and G.L. c. 235, § 8 (post‑judgment interest).

54. Plaintiff seeks all damages recoverable under Massachusetts law for negligence, including but not limited to those enumerated above.
