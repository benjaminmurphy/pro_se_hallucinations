      "proposition": "Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover for all damages proximately caused by Defendant\u2019s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and impairment or loss of enjoyment of life.",

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses liability, duty to warn, design negligence, consortium, and excessiveness of a damages award, but it does not set out or analyze the categories or scope of recoverable damages as a legal rule. The description of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and losses is used only to assess whether the jury\u2019s $440,000 verdict was excessive, not to articulate a doctrinal statement that Massachusetts law entitles plaintiffs to recover all proximate damages including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. Thus it does not serve as authority for the broad damages proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In concluding that the judge committed no error of law, we consider Ezila\u2019s age (twenty-nine) and weekly earnings ($140) at the time of the accident; the loss of ninety-five per cent of the function of her right hand (her dominant hand); her inability to perform many household tasks or to obtain employment; her pain and suffering, particularly while her hand was in the machine and while she was in the hospital where her fingers were amputated and skin grafts undertaken; her disfigurement, including scars from skin graft operations; her future need for artificial hands; and her continuing discomfort and embarrassment."
