v.                   Docket No. ___________

MICHAEL SMITH,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Michael Smith (“Defendant” or “Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Johnson (d/o/b: __________, age 10).

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, is an individual believed to reside in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Ethan Johnson.

3. The minor child, Ethan Johnson, currently resides primarily with the Plaintiff pursuant to an existing custody order of this Court.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this is a matter involving custody of a minor child whose home state is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody order was issued by this Court and the Plaintiff and the minor child reside in Bristol County.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about October 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment/Order (the “Existing Order”) granting the parties shared legal custody of the minor child, Ethan Johnson, with primary physical custody/residence with the Plaintiff and parenting time for the Defendant on certain weekends.

7. At the time the Existing Order was entered, the Court found, or implicitly determined, that both parents were then stable and capable of safely co‑parenting, and that the parenting plan then ordered was in the child’s best interests.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the Existing Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the safety and best interests of the minor child within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law, including but not limited to:  
   a. The Defendant’s apparent increased use of alcohol or other intoxicating substances during his parenting time;  
   b. The minor child’s observations and disclosures regarding such use;  
   c. Observed impairment of the Defendant while caring for the child; and  
   d. The child’s deteriorating condition (including exhaustion) immediately following weekends with the Defendant.

9. The minor child has reported to the Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at the Defendant’s home and that on certain occasions the Defendant “can’t walk straight.”

10. A neighbor who is familiar with the family situation sent the Plaintiff a video recording showing the Defendant stumbling and appearing impaired while removing the minor child from a vehicle late at night during the Defendant’s parenting time.

11. On information and belief, the Defendant’s use of alcohol or other intoxicants occurs during periods when he is responsible for the minor child’s care, including when driving with the child and during overnight parenting time.

12. The minor child’s school personnel have informed the Plaintiff that Ethan often appears exhausted on Monday mornings, following weekends spent at the Defendant’s residence. This pattern has become consistent and concerning.

13. The minor child’s physical appearance, behavior, and demeanor on Mondays (including, but not limited to, fatigue and difficulty focusing) reasonably suggest that his needs may not be appropriately met, and/or that he may not be receiving adequate rest and supervision, during overnights with the Defendant.

14. The Plaintiff has a good faith and reasonable belief, grounded in the child’s disclosures, the neighbor’s video evidence, and statements from school staff, that the Defendant may be abusing alcohol or other substances and may be impaired during parenting time with the minor child.

15. The circumstances described above were not contemplated by the Court at the time the Existing Order was entered, and they represent a material change in circumstances warranting reconsideration and modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions.

16. The continuing application of the Existing Order, in light of these changed circumstances, presents an unreasonable and unacceptable risk to the minor child’s safety, well‑being, and emotional and physical health.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

17. Under Massachusetts law, any order regarding custody or parenting time must serve the “best interests of the child.” See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

18. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., *Murphy v. Murphy*, 380 Mass. 454 (1980); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19. Continued unsupervised or unrestricted overnight parenting time where a parent is allegedly abusing alcohol or other intoxicants and appears impaired in the direct care of the child is inconsistent with the child’s best interests and may expose the child to risk of physical and emotional harm. See, e.g., *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983) (child’s welfare is paramount consideration); *Adoption of New England*, 364 Mass. 835 (1973).

20. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly emphasized the paramount importance of a child’s safety and stability in custody determinations. See, e.g., *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96 (court must protect child from potential harm); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript op.) (upholding limitations on visitation where necessary for child’s best interests); *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981) (deferring to trial court’s assessment of child’s welfare and need for protective conditions).

21. Where substance use or impairment by a parent during parenting time is credibly raised, the Court may impose appropriate safeguards, including supervision, conditions on visitation, or other protective orders, to ensure the child’s safety. See *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984) (court may impose conditions to protect children); *Adoption of Carlos*, 413 Mass. 339 (1992) (substance abuse relevant to parental fitness and child’s welfare).

22. In determining best interests, the Court may consider the minor child’s expressed experiences and observations, the pattern of behavior indicated by school reports, and objective evidence such as video recordings and third‑party observations. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 844–45 (court examines totality of circumstances); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 261–63.

23. The Plaintiff’s request is not intended to interfere with the child’s relationship with the Defendant, but rather to implement reasonable conditions and/or supervision so that the minor child can maintain a relationship with the Defendant in a manner that is safe and consistent with the child’s best interests.

24. Given the alleged impairment, late‑night driving and care of the minor child while possibly under the influence, and the child’s condition following weekends with the Defendant, modification of the Existing Order to provide for supervised or otherwise conditioned overnights with the Defendant is necessary to protect the child.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

25. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order of October 15, 2021, and that modification is required to serve the best interests of the minor child, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law, including but not limited to *Murphy v. Murphy*, *Custody of Vaughn*, and *Custody of Kali*.

26. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that this Court:

   a. Confirm that the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor child, Ethan Johnson;

   b. Confirm that the parties shall continue to share legal custody only to the extent that such shared legal custody remains in the child’s best interests and does not place the child at risk; and, if the Court finds that conflict or safety concerns render shared legal custody inappropriate, grant the Plaintiff sole legal custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31;

   c. Modify the Defendant’s parenting time so that any overnights with the Defendant are either:  
      i. Supervised by an appropriate third party or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court; or  
      ii. Subject to strict conditions designed to ensure the child’s safety, including but not limited to:  
         1. A prohibition on the use of alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs, or non‑prescribed controlled substances by the Defendant for at least twenty‑four (24) hours prior to and during any parenting time;  
         2. A prohibition on the Defendant operating a motor vehicle with the minor child as a passenger if the Defendant has consumed any alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs, or non‑prescribed controlled substances within the previous twenty‑four (24) hours;  
         3. The Defendant’s participation in and compliance with an alcohol and/or substance‑use evaluation by a qualified professional, and, if indicated, participation in recommended treatment;  
         4. The Defendant’s submission to random alcohol and/or drug testing at reasonable times, upon reasonable notice or as the Court deems appropriate, with results available to the Plaintiff and the Court; and  
         5. Any other safety‑related conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect the minor child;

   d. Alternatively, and until the Defendant demonstrates sustained sobriety and ability to safely parent, suspend the Defendant’s overnight parenting time and limit his parenting time to daytime visits, supervised or unsupervised as the Court deems appropriate, consistent with the minor child’s best interests;

   e. Order that all exchanges of the minor child occur at a safe, neutral location, and at times that avoid late‑night transitions where the Defendant’s alleged impairment has previously been observed;

   f. Order that the Defendant not consume or be under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants during any parenting time or for a reasonable period before parenting time, as determined by the Court;

   g. Order that the Defendant participate in any co‑parenting, parenting education, or other programs the Court finds helpful to the child’s welfare;

   h. Grant the Plaintiff authority to obtain information directly from the minor child’s school, medical providers, and counselors, and to share relevant safety concerns with such providers, consistent with applicable law and any existing or modified legal custody arrangement;

   i. Schedule this matter for a prompt Case Management Conference or Pre‑Trial Conference, and, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing to determine appropriate safeguards for the minor child; and

   j. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.

### VII. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION (SUMMARY OF AUTHORITIES)

27. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody or visitation judgment may be “revised or altered” upon a showing that “the circumstances of the parents or the benefit of the children” so require. See also *Murphy v. Murphy*, 380 Mass. 454 (1980).

28. The “material and substantial change in circumstances” standard is satisfied when new facts arise that were not and could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the prior judgment, and which affect the child’s welfare. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261–63 (2001).

29. The best interests of the child are the “touchstone” of any custody or visitation determination. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 841–45 (2003); G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10.

30. Substance abuse or impairment by a parent is a relevant and significant factor in assessing parental fitness and the safety and stability of the child’s environment. See *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704 (1984); *Adoption of Carlos*, 413 Mass. 339 (1992); *Adoption of Quentin*, 424 Mass. 882 (1997).

31. Courts are authorized to fashion orders, including supervised visitation and specific safety‑related conditions, to protect a child while preserving, where possible, the parent‑child relationship. See *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the October 15, 2021 custody order;

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time arrangement is necessary to protect the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Johnson;

3. Enter a Modified Judgment consistent with the requests set forth in Paragraph 26 above; and

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
SARAH JOHNSON,  
Pro Se
