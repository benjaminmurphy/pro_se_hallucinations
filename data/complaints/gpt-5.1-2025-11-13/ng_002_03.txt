COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED  

------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Jessica Wang (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Michael Davidson (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Wang is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff was a lawful user of public recreational space in the City of Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Davidson is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, kept, and/or controlled a dog that he regularly brought to a public park located near or at 30 Cole Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising from negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum amount required for civil jurisdiction in the District Court Department, exclusive of interest and costs, but does not exceed the jurisdictional maximum. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A, 21.

5. Venue is proper in the Newton Division of the District Court Department because the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 2, 8.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 15, 2023, at approximately 30 Cole Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a designated path in a public park (the “Park”).

7. The Park contains conspicuous posted signs stating that all dogs must be leashed at all times while in the Park or on its paths.

8. Upon information and belief, Defendant is a regular user of the Park and frequently allows his large dog to run off‑leash in the Park notwithstanding the posted leash requirements.

9. On June 15, 2023, Defendant was present in the Park with his large dog. Defendant had a leash in his possession, which he was holding over his shoulder, but the leash was not attached to the dog.

10. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from Plaintiff, talking with friends, and was not maintaining control over his dog.

11. As Plaintiff was jogging along the path, Defendant’s dog suddenly and without warning charged directly at Plaintiff from the side of the path, barking loudly and aggressively.

12. The dog ran toward Plaintiff at speed and closed the distance rapidly. At that moment, Plaintiff did not know whether the dog would attack or bite her.

13. Plaintiff reasonably perceived an imminent risk of being bitten or otherwise physically harmed by the charging, barking dog.

14. In a split‑second effort to avoid the dog and protect herself, Plaintiff swerved abruptly off the paved path to her right.

15. As Plaintiff left the path, she encountered uneven ground and an exposed tree root. Plaintiff’s foot caught on the tree root, causing her to lose balance.

16. Plaintiff fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path and landed with significant force on her outstretched arm and wrist.

17. As a direct result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a broken wrist.

18. The dog stopped when Plaintiff fell. Only after Plaintiff had fallen did Defendant call the dog back to him.

19. The dog did not physically strike or touch Plaintiff; however, Plaintiff’s evasive reaction to Defendant’s uncontrolled, charging dog was the direct and natural response to Defendant’s failure to restrain his dog.

20. Several other joggers and park users witnessed the incident, including the dog running off‑leash, charging and barking at Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s sudden attempt to avoid the dog, and Plaintiff’s fall.

21. Plaintiff was transported to receive emergency medical care and was treated for a fractured wrist at a hospital emergency room.

22. Plaintiff’s injuries required her to wear a brace for several weeks, to attend follow‑up medical care, and to endure pain, limitation of motion, and loss of function in her wrist and hand.

23. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time and lost approximately $1,200 in wages.

24. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for emergency treatment, diagnostic imaging, follow‑up care, and related medical services.

25. Plaintiff also was unable to participate in a piano recital for which she had been preparing, causing her emotional distress, frustration, and loss of enjoyment of life.

26. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was using the Park and jogging path in a foreseeable, ordinary, and lawful manner.

27. At all relevant times, Defendant knew or reasonably should have known:  
    a. that the Park required dogs to be on leashes at all times;  
    b. that his dog was large and capable of causing fear, injury, or loss of control if allowed to run loose; and  
    c. that allowing a large dog to run off‑leash and to charge at people created a foreseeable risk of physical injury to joggers and other park users, including injury caused by evasive action to avoid the dog.

28. The risk that a person would panic or take sudden evasive action, such as swerving or jumping away from a charging, barking dog and thereby fall and be injured, was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s conduct.

29. Defendant failed to keep his dog leashed and under control, in violation of posted park rules and in disregard of the safety of park users such as Plaintiff.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and suffered pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

31. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts common law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating foreseeable risks of harm to others. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–48 (2006); *Remy v. MacDonald*, 440 Mass. 675, 677–78 (2004).

33. Owners and keepers of dogs in Massachusetts owe a duty to use reasonable care in controlling and restraining their dogs so as to prevent foreseeable injury to others lawfully on public or private property. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147–49; *Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 283 Mass. 158, 161–62 (1933).

34. That general duty of reasonable care includes the obligation to comply with applicable statutes, ordinances, and posted rules concerning the control, restraint, and leashing of dogs in public places, and to avoid conduct that creates an unreasonable risk that others will suffer physical harm. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000).

35. The City of Newton, pursuant to G.L. c. 140, §§ 136A–174F, and its municipal home rule authority, has adopted ordinances and regulations requiring that dogs in public parks and on public ways be restrained or leashed, and the Park where this incident occurred was posted with signs expressly requiring all dogs to be on leashes.

36. Violation of a safety statute, ordinance, or regulation designed to protect the public can constitute evidence of negligence in Massachusetts. See *Bennett*, 408 Mass. at 358–59; *Kaneshiro v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 354 Mass. 630, 632–33 (1968); *Richards v. Warren*, 366 Mass. 782, 786 (1975).

37. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful park user, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, keeping, and control of his dog, including the duty to keep the dog on a leash as required by the posted rules and to prevent the dog from running at or charging park users.

38. Defendant breached that duty of care by, among other things:  
    a. bringing a large dog into the Park and allowing it to run off‑leash despite posted requirements that dogs be leashed;  
    b. failing to maintain proper physical control over the dog, even though Defendant was in possession of a leash;  
    c. allowing the dog to run freely at a distance from him while he conversed with friends, without close supervision;  
    d. failing to prevent the dog from charging, running toward, and barking at Plaintiff, a known and visible park user; and  
    e. failing to take timely and reasonable steps to recall, restrain, or otherwise control the dog before it created a foreseeable risk of harm.

39. It was reasonably foreseeable that allowing a large dog to run loose and to charge at a person on a jogging path could cause that person either to be physically struck or bitten by the dog or, alternatively, to take sudden evasive action (such as swerving, jumping, or running off the path) and thereby suffer injury from a fall or collision with some hazard in the vicinity. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147–49 (duty extends to foreseeable consequences of failure to control dangerous instrumentality); *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640–41 (1996) (foreseeability governs scope of duty).

40. Under Massachusetts law, a negligent actor is liable for all harm that is within the scope of the foreseeable risk created by his conduct, including harm that occurs when an injured person takes reasonable evasive action to avoid an immediate perceived threat. See *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978) (defendant liable where plaintiff was injured attempting to avoid danger created by defendant’s negligence); *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902–03 (1987) (same principle of foreseeable reaction to danger).

41. Plaintiff’s reaction—swerving off the path to avoid a charging, barking dog—was a reasonable and foreseeable response to the danger created by Defendant’s negligence. That Plaintiff’s injury ultimately resulted from her fall over an exposed tree root and down a small embankment does not break the chain of causation. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (proximate cause exists where defendant’s negligence is a substantial contributing factor in bringing about harm within foreseeable risk); *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002).

42. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages. Defendant’s conduct created the very risk—injury during evasive action taken to avoid an uncontrolled animal—that resulted in Plaintiff’s harm.

43. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligence and did not voluntarily or unreasonably expose herself to the danger created by Defendant’s off‑leash dog. Plaintiff was simply jogging on the path in a normal and foreseeable manner.

44. To the extent Plaintiff’s own conduct is alleged to have contributed to her injuries, any such comparative negligence is minimal and, in any event, does not exceed fifty percent of the total negligence that proximately caused her injuries. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence).

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained and continues to sustain the following damages, among others:

   a. **Medical Expenses:** Approximately $2,500 in past medical bills related to emergency room treatment, diagnostic imaging, and follow‑up care for her broken wrist, and the reasonable value of any future medical care that may be required. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85K (regarding damages and prejudgment interest);

   b. **Lost Wages and Impaired Earning Capacity:** Approximately $1,200 in lost income due to missed work while recovering from the injury, and any additional loss or impairment of earning capacity proven at trial;

   c. **Pain and Suffering:** Physical pain, discomfort, limitation of motion, and interference with daily activities and hobbies, including playing the piano and participating in a scheduled piano recital;

   d. **Emotional Distress and Loss of Enjoyment of Life:** Emotional distress, fear, anxiety, frustration, and loss of enjoyment of life associated with the incident, the injury, and the resulting limitations;

   e. **Other Consequential Damages:** Any and all other consequential and incidental damages, costs, and losses that are reasonably certain to be proven at trial, including but not limited to transportation costs for medical care and out‑of‑pocket expenses.

46. Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all her damages proximately caused by his negligence under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146–49; *Vassallo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.*, 428 Mass. 1, 21–22 (1998) (damages in negligence include all reasonably foreseeable injuries flowing from wrongful conduct).
