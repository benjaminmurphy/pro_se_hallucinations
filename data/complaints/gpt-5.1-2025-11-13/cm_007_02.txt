MICHAEL COLLINS,  
    Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Michael Collins (“Father”), is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:  
   a. Samantha Collins, date of birth: ____________ (age 12).

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters of custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child under G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Court’s prior judgment entered on May 14, 2019.

5. Venue in the Middlesex Division of the Probate and Family Court is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3, because the existing judgment was entered here and the child resides within this county.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

6. On or about May 14, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment (or Separation Agreement incorporated and merged into a Judgment) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor child (“2019 Judgment”).

7. Under the 2019 Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody of Samantha and equal (50/50) physical custody on an alternating week‑on, week‑off schedule. This schedule has been in place since approximately May 2019.

8. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, both parties lived in close proximity to each other, were in good physical health, and were able to provide safe, independent care for Samantha during their respective parenting time.

9. Following entry of the 2019 Judgment, the 50/50 week‑on/week‑off arrangement functioned well for several years. Samantha developed and maintained healthy routines, academic performance, and emotional stability in both homes.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the safety and best interests of the minor child, as required by G.L. c. 208, § 28 and cases such as *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); and *Mussa v. Mass. Trial Court*, 66 Mass. App. Ct. 1116 (2006) (Rule 1:28).

11. Recently, Father has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that significantly impairs his mobility, balance, and ability to respond quickly in physical situations involving the minor child.

12. As a result of this condition, Father has experienced multiple falls in his home, including falls in the presence of or in proximity to Samantha.

13. Father’s treating physician has instructed Father that, due to his condition, he should not be alone with the minor child in circumstances involving stairs, transfers, or any setting that might require rapid physical response to protect the child from harm.

14. Notwithstanding these medical limitations, Father has insisted on maintaining the same 50/50, week‑on/week‑off schedule established by the 2019 Judgment, without modification to reflect his diminished physical capacity.

15. During Father’s parenting time, Father at times relies on Samantha, a 12‑year‑old child, to assist him with physical tasks such as helping him transfer between his wheelchair and bed, retrieving or carrying items for him, and otherwise supporting his mobility.

16. Samantha has expressed to Mother that she feels scared, overwhelmed, and responsible for Father’s physical safety during these episodes, particularly when Father is unsteady or at risk of falling.

17. Samantha’s role in assisting with Father’s mobility and physical care is developmentally inappropriate given her age and exposes her to unnecessary emotional stress and potential physical danger.

18. The combination of Father’s progressive neurological condition, his documented falls, the medical instructions limiting his ability to be alone with the child in certain settings, and his continued insistence on an unchanged 50/50 schedule constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the child’s safety and welfare, within the meaning of *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); and *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

19. The circumstances now facing Samantha were not contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the 2019 Judgment and could not reasonably have been anticipated, satisfying the standard for modification articulated in *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) and *Granata v. Granata*, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 362 (2017).

20. Father’s condition is described as progressive, such that his physical limitations are likely to continue and may worsen over time, increasing the risks to Samantha if the current custodial arrangement is left unchanged.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

21. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting‑time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); and *Custody of Zia*, 455 Mass. 530 (2009).

22. In assessing the child’s best interests, the Court must consider the child’s safety, emotional well‑being, stability, and the capacity of each parent to provide appropriate care, guidance, and a secure environment. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843‑44.

23. While Father’s diagnosis and physical limitations do not, by themselves, disqualify him from parenting, the practical impact of his condition on his ability to safely manage the child’s day‑to‑day care—particularly in emergency or physically demanding situations—must be weighed under the best‑interests standard. See *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. 595 (1981); *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007).

24. It is not in Samantha’s best interests to bear a significant caregiving burden for a physically disabled parent, to worry about Father’s safety, or to be placed in situations where her own physical safety could be compromised due to Father’s inability to respond promptly to hazards such as falls, stairs, or other emergencies.

25. The current 50/50 week‑on/week‑off arrangement, which was appropriate when both parents were healthy and fully able to care for the child, no longer serves Samantha’s best interests in light of Father’s current and evolving medical condition.

26. Mother is able and willing to assume primary physical custody of Samantha, to provide a stable, safe home environment, to ensure continuity of schooling, medical care, and activities, and to facilitate and encourage Samantha’s continued relationship with Father to the fullest extent safely possible.

27. A modification to grant Mother primary physical custody, while preserving meaningful and frequent parenting time for Father in settings and durations that can be safely managed in light of his condition, will better protect Samantha’s physical safety, emotional well‑being, and developmental needs, as contemplated by G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); and *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

28. The requested modification is not sought to interfere with Father’s relationship with Samantha, but rather to conform the parenting plan to current medical realities and to reduce the inappropriate caregiving burden that has fallen on a 12‑year‑old child.

### V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

29. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify any judgment regarding custody or parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See also *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

30. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a significant change in a parent’s health or capacity that affects the child’s welfare may constitute the requisite material and substantial change. See, e.g., *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (changes in family circumstances and parental capacity may warrant modification); *Granata v. Granata*, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 362 (2017).

31. The combination of Father’s progressive neurological diagnosis, documented falls, medical instructions limiting his ability to be alone with the child in certain physical situations, and reliance on Samantha to assist with his mobility and personal care, together with their effect on Samantha’s safety and emotional well‑being, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the cases cited above.

32. Where, as here, the existing custodial arrangement has become inconsistent with the child’s safety and best interests, this Court has both the authority and the obligation to modify the prior judgment. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

33. In fashioning a modified order, the Court may grant one parent primary physical custody while maintaining joint legal custody, and may craft a parenting‑time schedule that reflects the child’s best interests in light of the current circumstances. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

34. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2019 Judgment, and that a modification is necessary to protect the best interests of the minor child.

35. Mother specifically requests that:

   a. **Primary Physical Custody**: Mother be awarded primary physical custody of Samantha, with Samantha’s principal residence to be with Mother.

   b. **Legal Custody**: The parties continue to share joint legal custody, subject to further order of the Court, so long as they are able to communicate regarding major decisions affecting the child’s health, education, and welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 31.

   c. **Parenting Time for Father**: Father be granted reasonable, frequent, and meaningful parenting time with Samantha, structured in a manner that takes into account Father’s medical condition and ensures the child’s safety, such as:
      - Regular, scheduled parenting time with Father on weekends or specific days, of reduced duration as compared to the 50/50 week‑on/week‑off schedule;  
      - Consideration of daytime visits, supervised or assisted as medically indicated, especially where stairs or physically demanding environments are involved; and  
      - Parenting time to occur in locations and under conditions that minimize physical risk to Samantha and eliminate any expectation that she serve as a primary caregiver or physical assistant to Father.

   d. **Transportation and Logistics**: Transportation and exchange of the child be arranged in a manner reasonably accommodating Father’s physical limitations while prioritizing Samantha’s safety and routine.

   e. **Further Orders as Needed**: The Court enter any additional orders necessary to implement a safe and appropriate parenting plan, including, if needed, the appointment of a Guardian ad Litem or other professional to evaluate the child’s best interests, pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 56A and related authority.

   f. **All Other Relief**: The Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 14, 2019 custody and parenting‑time order;

2. Determine that it is in the best interests of the minor child, Samantha Collins, that the existing physical‑custody and parenting‑time provisions be modified;

3. Award Jessica Collins primary physical custody of Samantha, with joint legal custody to remain with both parents, subject to further order of the Court;

4. Establish a revised parenting‑time schedule for Michael Collins that provides frequent and meaningful contact with Samantha in a manner that is safe, developmentally appropriate, and consistent with Father’s current medical limitations;

5. Enter such additional orders relating to transportation, decision‑making, and communication between the parties as may be necessary to implement the modified custodial arrangements; and

6. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, appropriate, and in the best interests of the child.

Respectfully submitted,
