MARK THOMPSON,

-------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Avery Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Avery Johnson is an individual residing at and renting an apartment located at 45 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, owns, manages, and/or controls the residential rental property located at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, including the Premises and the adjacent unit currently under renovation.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and is responsible for ensuring Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and habitability of the Premises.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and applicable court rules.

5. The amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court. Plaintiff seeks damages of approximately Eight Hundred Dollars ($800), plus statutory damages, costs, interest, and such other relief as the Court deems just.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Cambridge. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2; Mass. R. Civ. P. 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.

8. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid, or been ready, willing, and able to pay, monthly rent in the amount of Two Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($2,200) to Defendant pursuant to the rental agreement.

9. As a matter of law, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929).

10. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises” by a tenant.

11. Plaintiff works from home and regularly conducts work-related calls and other business activities at the Premises during daytime hours.

12. In or about early October 2025, Defendant commenced substantial renovation or construction work in the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises at 45 Elm Street.

13. The work has involved frequent and loud drilling, hammering, banging, and other construction activity, as well as loud conversation by the workers immediately adjacent to, or in very close proximity to, Plaintiff’s Premises.

14. The construction noise has typically begun at or around 8:00 a.m. and continued until around 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, with little or no respite during those hours.

15. The disruptive construction noise has persisted on an almost daily basis for approximately two (2) months, and Defendant has indicated that it may continue for an additional one (1) to two (2) months.

16. The noise has been so loud and continuous that Plaintiff has had difficulty hearing and participating in work-related telephone and video calls, has been forced to reschedule or relocate work activities where possible, and has suffered significant interference with the normal and reasonable use and enjoyment of the Premises.

17. In addition to the noise, dust and debris generated by the renovation work have entered Plaintiff’s Premises through vents or other openings, causing discomfort and concern for cleanliness and air quality within the apartment.

18. Plaintiff has complained to Defendant about the intensity, duration, and impact of the construction noise and dust, and has requested relief to mitigate these conditions and protect Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

19. Defendant has acknowledged the renovation work and its impact on Plaintiff, and offered Plaintiff a one‑time rent reduction of approximately One Hundred Dollars ($100) for one month.

20. This minor, temporary rent reduction has not adequately compensated for, or alleviated, the ongoing and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises over a multi‑month period.

21. While Defendant notified Plaintiff generally that renovation work would occur and has limited the work to daytime weekday hours, the scope, intensity, and prolonged duration of the noise and dust have nonetheless substantially deprived Plaintiff of the quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises that a reasonable tenant would expect. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

22. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been continuous and ongoing over a period of at least two months and is expected to continue for another one to two months, resulting in a prolonged and material impairment of the value of the tenancy to Plaintiff.

23. Defendant, as landlord, has the ability and obligation to plan, schedule, and manage renovation work in a way that does not unreasonably and substantially interfere with tenants’ quiet enjoyment of their apartments.

24. Defendant either knew or reasonably should have known that the manner and duration of the renovation work, including the intense weekday daytime noise and dust infiltration into Plaintiff’s unit, would substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, particularly where Plaintiff works from home.

25. Defendant’s actions and omissions have caused Plaintiff substantial annoyance, discomfort, stress, loss of use of significant portions of the apartment during normal business hours, and impairment of Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises as a reasonably quiet place to live and work.

26. As a result of Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, the value of the tenancy to Plaintiff has been significantly diminished, and Plaintiff has suffered damages estimated at approximately Eight Hundred Dollars ($800), exclusive of any statutory multiple damages or other relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

27. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–26 as if fully set forth herein.

28. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and G.L. c. 186, § 14 expressly prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

29. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant against acts or omissions by a landlord (or those for whom the landlord is responsible) that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929).

30. The standard for a breach of quiet enjoyment is whether the landlord’s conduct, or failure to act, has the “natural and probable effect” of substantially interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

31. A landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 can arise from actions that are not malicious but are nevertheless unreasonable and cause substantial interference with the tenant’s enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–19; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979).

32. Here, Defendant, directly or indirectly, caused or allowed ongoing, intense construction noise and dust from the adjacent unit to penetrate Plaintiff’s Premises on an almost daily basis, for many consecutive weeks, during core daytime hours.

33. This pattern and duration of disruptive noise and dust constituted a substantial and material interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as a residence and place of work, exceeding the level of inconvenience a reasonable tenant should be expected to tolerate.

34. The interference was not momentary or trivial, but ongoing for months and anticipated to continue further, materially impairing the quiet enjoyment and value of the tenancy. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982) (recognizing substantial interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment from persistent conditions); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

35. Defendant had control over the renovations, the manner in which they were conducted, and the mitigation measures that could have reduced the impact on Plaintiff, but failed to adequately manage or mitigate the noise and dust.

36. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that carrying out renovations in the manner and duration described above, adjacent to Plaintiff’s home and workplace, would have the natural and probable effect of substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

37. Defendant’s conduct and omissions therefore constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts common law and a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–19; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 199–201; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

38. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or, at the tenant’s election, for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

39. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages from the diminished value of the tenancy, distress, and loss of use, reasonably estimated at Eight Hundred Dollars ($800). See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (damages for diminished use and enjoyment); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 400–02 (1982) (upholding damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

40. Although Plaintiff is proceeding pro se and does not presently seek attorney’s fees, Plaintiff seeks actual damages and such statutory remedies as are available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to three months’ rent if the Court finds such relief appropriate, together with costs and interest.

41. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is continuing or is reasonably expected to continue in the immediate future, and injunctive or other equitable relief may be necessary to prevent further harm. See Doe, 417 Mass. at 289–90 (equitable relief appropriate to protect tenants’ rights).
