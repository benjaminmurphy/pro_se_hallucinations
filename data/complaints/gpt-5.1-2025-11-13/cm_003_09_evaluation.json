      "support_reasoning": "The quoted concurrence in Smith v. McDonald is focused on statutory interpretation of the paternity statute, the mother\u2019s sole legal custody before adjudication, and the inapplicability of the Yannas \u2018removal\u2019 framework. It discusses stability and preserving the status quo, but does not address or articulate any \u2018material change in circumstances\u2019 requirement, nor does it describe that requirement as a mechanism to ensure stability while allowing response to changed factual underpinnings. Thus, this case does not provide direct authority for the specific proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"After paternity was established, the judge was obligated to take as a given that the mother and the child resided 400 miles apart from, and in another State than, the father, and to fashion custody and visitation orders pursuant to the three factors set out in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), again respecting and not disturbing the mother\u2019s decision to relocate. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003) ('If the parenting arrangement in which a child has lived is satisfactory and is reasonably capable of preservation, it is ordinarily in the child\u2019s best interests to maintain that arrangement\u2026').\""
