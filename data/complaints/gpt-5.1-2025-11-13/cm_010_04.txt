PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
MIDDLESEX DIVISION

SARAH THOMPSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.                    
MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

Docket No.: ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time)  

PARTIES AND JURISDICTION  

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson (“Mother”), resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the biological mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, born [Month] [Day], 2015 (now age 10).

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the biological father of the minor child, Emily Johnson.

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters relating to the custody, care, and support of the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10, 20 (as applicable); G.L. c. 215, § 6; and the prior Judgment of this Court dated May 15, 2018.

4. Venue in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court is proper because the prior Judgment was entered in this division and the child resides within the jurisdiction of this Court.

PRIOR JUDGMENT  

5. On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child, Emily Johnson (the “2018 Judgment”).

6. Pursuant to the 2018 Judgment, the parties share (or, if applicable, one party holds) legal custody of Emily, with primary physical custody / primary residence granted to Father, and with Mother having limited parenting time consisting of:

   a. Weekend parenting time (on a limited basis); and  

   b. One weeknight dinner visit each week, without an overnight.  

7. The parenting plan adopted at that time was expressly based on Mother’s circumstances in 2018, including:  

   a. Mother’s enrollment in graduate school with a demanding and inflexible academic schedule;  

   b. Mother’s residence in a small studio apartment, which did not reasonably accommodate the child for extended or regular overnights; and  

   c. The Court’s assessment at that time of the child’s best interests in light of Mother’s then-limited availability and housing situation.  

8. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, substantial and material changes in circumstances affecting the child’s best interests have occurred, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions.  

MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES  

9. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody or parenting-time order where (1) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:  

   • G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of judgments regarding custody of minor children);  
   • G.L. c. 208, § 31 (defining legal and physical custody and the “best interests of the child” standard);  
   • G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a) (modification of custody and visitation orders in paternity cases);  
   • Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (modification requires material change of circumstances and best interests analysis);  
   • Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests analysis must consider present circumstances, including child’s needs and parental capacities);  
   • Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (custody determinations and modifications hinge upon best interests of the child, not parental preferences).  

10. Since the entry of the 2018 Judgment, the following material and substantial changes have occurred:

Mother’s Education and Employment  

11. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, Mother was enrolled in graduate school, with demanding coursework, variable hours, and limited control over her schedule. She often had evening classes, study obligations, and clinical or practicum responsibilities that limited her practical ability to provide routine care for Emily during weeknights and extended weekends.

12. Since that time, Mother has successfully completed her graduate degree.

13. Mother now has a stable, full-time job with regular, predictable, and “normal” daytime hours, providing her with consistent evenings and weekends free to care for Emily.

14. Mother’s current employment and schedule allow her to reliably meet Emily’s day-to-day needs, including transportation to and from school and activities, homework supervision, meals, bedtime routines, and weekend activities.

15. Mother’s increased availability and stability constitute a material change from the circumstances the Court considered in 2018 when limiting her parenting time. See, e.g., Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (finding that a material change may arise when a parent’s living or employment circumstances have significantly improved); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (stability in a parent’s lifestyle and home can support a modification in custody or parenting time).

Mother’s Housing and Ability to Provide Appropriate Accommodations  

16. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, Mother lived in a small studio apartment, which the Court reasonably viewed as less than ideal for extended or frequent overnight parenting time with a preschool-aged child.

17. Mother now resides in a two-bedroom apartment in Middlesex County.

18. Mother has arranged her home so that Emily has her own bedroom, with her own bed, clothes, personal belongings, and space, providing a stable and comfortable environment for overnight and extended parenting time.

19. Mother’s improved housing — both in size and suitability for the child — is a significant and material change from the circumstances underlying the prior order, warranting reconsideration of the parenting schedule. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (recognizing that changes in a custodial or residential situation must be evaluated within the broader context of the child’s best interests); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

Child’s Age, Maturity, and Evolving Needs  

20. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, Emily was approximately four years old, of preschool age.

21. Emily is now ten years old, school-aged, and significantly more mature. Her developmental needs, social life, schooling, and emotional capacity are all materially different from when the prior judgment was issued.

22. With Emily’s increased age and maturity, she can better articulate her feelings, preferences, and needs with respect to her relationships with both parents and the amount of time she spends in each household.

23. Massachusetts law recognizes that as children grow older, their preferences and developmental needs may become more relevant to the best-interests analysis. See, e.g., Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 231–32 (1998) (a child’s preferences may be considered in a best-interests determination, especially as the child matures); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (emphasizing the importance of present circumstances and the evolving needs and attachments of the child).

24. Emily’s present age and developmental stage constitute a material change in circumstances from the time when the parenting plan was fashioned for a four-year-old with a nonresidential, limited-schedule mother.

Strengthened Mother–Child Relationship  

25. Since the 2018 Judgment, and particularly over the last several years, Mother and Emily have developed a very close, loving, and secure relationship.

26. Emily looks to Mother for emotional support, guidance with school and social issues, and regular participation in her life and activities.

27. Emily’s therapist has reported that Emily feels sad and guilty when she must leave Mother’s home after short visits, and has expressed a desire for more time, including additional overnights, with Mother.

28. Emily has independently written a letter to the Court expressing her wish to spend more time with Mother and to have more overnights at Mother’s home.

29. While a minor child’s preference is not determinative, Massachusetts courts recognize that the child’s expressed wishes, particularly those of a mature child, are one factor to be weighed in assessing best interests. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 231–32; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 599.  

30. The strengthening of the Mother–child bond, Emily’s increased desire to spend more time with Mother, and her articulated distress over the current limited arrangement are material changes that were not present or foreseeable at the time of the 2018 Judgment.

Father’s Resistance to Reasonable Adjustment of Schedule  

31. Mother has attempted to raise with Father, in a reasonable manner, the possibility of modifying or informally expanding Emily’s time with Mother, given Mother’s improved circumstances and Emily’s stated wishes.

32. Father has refused to discuss any substantive changes to the parenting plan.

33. When Emily has attempted to bring up her desire for more time with Mother, Father has become angry or upset, which has caused Emily additional stress and emotional conflict.

34. Father’s refusal to consider expanded contact with Mother, even as circumstances have significantly changed and as the child has expressed a clear desire for more time, exacerbates Emily’s feelings of guilt and anxiety and undermines her emotional well-being.

35. This pattern of resistance to reasonable modification in light of changed circumstances supports the need for Court intervention to adjust the schedule in Emily’s best interests. See, e.g., Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript) (recognizing that court intervention may be necessary where one parent’s conduct impedes the child’s relationship with the other parent); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (emphasizing promotion of frequent and continuing contact with both parents when in the child’s best interests).

36. The totality of these changes — Mother’s completion of graduate school, her stable employment with normal hours, her move to a suitable two-bedroom apartment where Emily has her own room, Emily’s increased age and maturity, the strengthening of the Mother–child bond, Emily’s expressed wish for more time with Mother, and Father’s refusal to reasonably adjust the schedule — constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since May 15, 2018.

BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD  

37. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the overarching standard in any custody or parenting-time determination is the “best interests of the child.” See also G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

38. The best-interests analysis considers, among other factors:

   a. The child’s age, needs, and developmental stage;  

   b. The child’s emotional ties with each parent;  

   c. Each parent’s capacity to meet the child’s physical, emotional, moral, and educational needs;  

   d. The willingness of each parent to support and encourage the child’s relationship with the other parent; and  

   e. The stability of the child’s environment and the need for continued contact with both parents, where appropriate.  

See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).

39. Mother is fully able and willing to support Emily’s relationship with Father and to foster frequent and continuing contact between Emily and Father, consistent with Emily’s best interests.

40. Mother’s improved employment and housing now allow her to provide Emily with a stable, safe, and nurturing home environment for extended periods, including school nights and weekends.

41. Emily’s emotional health and sense of security will be enhanced by having more meaningful, routine, and overnight time with Mother, rather than the currently limited weekend and one-weeknight-dinner-only arrangement.

42. Expanded overnights and parenting time with Mother would:

   a. Allow Emily to develop deeper day-to-day connections with Mother;  

   b. Reduce Emily’s reported guilt and sadness about leaving Mother’s home after short visits;  

   c. Give Emily greater stability and predictability in her relationships with both parents; and  

   d. More accurately reflect Emily’s present needs, wishes, and attachments as a ten-year-old child.  

43. The requested modification does not seek to impair or sever Emily’s relationship with Father, but rather to adjust the current plan so that Emily can enjoy substantial, meaningful time with both parents.

44. Massachusetts public policy strongly favors arrangements that maintain and encourage a child’s ongoing relationships with both parents, whenever consistent with the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

45. Considering the material changes in circumstances and the factors enumerated above, it is in Emily Johnson’s best interests that the Court modify the existing parenting-time provisions to grant Mother increased and regular overnights and additional parenting time.

REQUESTED MODIFICATION  

46. Mother seeks a modification of the 2018 Judgment solely with respect to physical custody / parenting time (and any related provisions necessary to effectuate an updated parenting schedule), without changing any existing legal-custody designation except as the Court deems necessary and in the child’s best interests.

47. Mother respectfully requests that the Court enter an order substantially increasing her parenting time and overnights with Emily, including, for example (subject to the Court’s adjustment as it finds appropriate):

   a. Regular, weekly overnight parenting time during the school year, such as from after school (or 5:00 p.m.) one weekday until school drop-off (or 9:00 a.m.) the following morning;  

   b. Extended weekend parenting time on alternating weekends, including overnights from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m.) through Sunday evening;  

   c. A fair and reasonable division of school vacations, holidays, and summer parenting time, so that Emily spends substantial uninterrupted periods with each parent; and  

   d. Any other schedule or allocation of physical custody that the Court finds to be in Emily’s best interests, reflecting Mother’s improved stability and Emily’s present needs and preferences.  

48. Mother further requests that the Court reaffirm that both parents shall encourage and support Emily’s relationship with the other parent, refrain from disparaging the other parent in Emily’s presence, and make reasonable efforts to reduce conflict so that Emily is not placed in the middle of adult disputes.

49. In seeking this modification, Mother does not allege that Father is unfit or that his home is unsafe, but rather that the prior limited parenting-time schedule is no longer appropriate in light of the material changes in circumstances and Emily’s best interests.

50. Accordingly, under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, and related case law, the Court should find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and that modifying the existing custody / parenting-time order is necessary and appropriate for the best interests of Emily Johnson.

RELIEF REQUESTED  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2018 Judgment concerning custody and parenting time for Emily Johnson;

2. Find that modification of the existing custody / parenting-time provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson;

3. Modify the prior Judgment to provide the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, with substantially increased parenting time and overnights with Emily Johnson, including a regular school-year schedule, alternating weekends, and a fair division of holidays, vacations, and summer time, or such other schedule as the Court deems to be in Emily’s best interests;

4. Order that both parties support and foster Emily’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from conduct that undermines that relationship;

5. Order any additional provisions regarding communication, transportation, and logistics as the Court deems necessary to implement the modified parenting plan;

6. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
SARAH THOMPSON,
