EMILY CARTER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

JAMES MCALLISTER,  
    Defendant.  


COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)


Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Carter”) alleges as follows against Defendant James McAllister (“Defendant” or “Mr. McAllister”):


                              I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 456 Green Street, Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts 01604.

2. Defendant James McAllister is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential premises located at 456 Green Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 (the “Premises”).

3. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.


                          II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A and G.L. c. 212, § 3, in that Plaintiff seeks money damages well within this Court’s jurisdictional limits arising from a residential landlord‑tenant relationship in Worcester, Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in the Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the Premises are located in Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this county.


                           III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a tenancy with Defendant for a residential apartment located at 456 Green Street, Worcester, MA 01604.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises as her home since on or about May 1, 2022.

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Premises is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has paid rent to Defendant and has substantially complied with her obligations as a tenant.

10. Plaintiff maintains the Premises, and in particular the kitchen, in a clean and sanitary condition, regularly cleaning food preparation and storage areas and disposing of trash appropriately.

11. Approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen, including on countertops, in cabinets, and near food storage areas.

12. The presence of mouse droppings indicates an active rodent infestation in or affecting the Premises and presents health and safety concerns, including the possible transmission of disease and contamination of food.

13. Upon first discovering mouse droppings, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem.

14. After Plaintiff’s notice, Defendant placed a few mouse traps in or around the kitchen area.

15. The traps caught approximately two mice; however, Plaintiff continued to find fresh mouse droppings on a regular basis thereafter.

16. Plaintiff informed Defendant that the mouse problem was ongoing and that she continued to find droppings in the kitchen.

17. Defendant responded, in substance, that such conditions were “normal for older buildings” and suggested that Plaintiff needed to keep the kitchen “cleaner,” notwithstanding Plaintiff’s already high level of cleanliness.

18. Plaintiff reasonably took offense at Defendant’s implication that she was the cause of the infestation, given her efforts to keep the kitchen spotless.

19. At some point after Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant hired an exterminator to visit the Premises.

20. The exterminator made a single visit and implemented limited pest control measures.

21. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive and/or follow‑up treatment to address the rodent problem effectively.

22. Plaintiff communicated to Defendant that the exterminator had indicated that more thorough and ongoing treatment was likely necessary to resolve the infestation affecting the Premises.

23. Defendant refused to authorize or arrange for additional, comprehensive pest control measures, stating that such measures were “overkill” and “too expensive.”

24. Since Defendant’s limited response, Plaintiff has continued to discover mouse droppings in her kitchen on a weekly basis over a period of several months.

25. Because of the ongoing rodent activity and contamination, Plaintiff has had to discard approximately $200 worth of food products, including boxed, bagged, and other unsealed items that were exposed to potential contamination.

26. Plaintiff, in an effort to mitigate the problem and protect her remaining food from contamination, purchased plastic storage containers and similar items to seal and protect food, at a cost of approximately $80.

27. Plaintiff has incurred these food and container costs as a direct result of the rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to abate it.

28. The persistent presence of mouse droppings and evidence of rodent activity has made Plaintiff anxious and uncomfortable about cooking and eating in her own kitchen.

29. Plaintiff reasonably fears disease and contamination whenever she prepares or consumes food in the Premises due to the mouse droppings and the inadequately addressed infestation.

30. The rodent infestation and contamination substantially interfere with the ordinary and reasonable use and enjoyment of the Premises as a residence, particularly with respect to safe and sanitary food preparation and consumption.

31. Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant that the problem persisted and that she continued to find mouse droppings, but Defendant has not taken sufficient steps to remedy the infestation or prevent its recurrence.

32. Defendant has refused to implement the more comprehensive pest control measures recommended by the exterminator and reasonably necessary to cure the infestation.

33. Defendant’s failure to adequately and promptly remedy the rodent infestation constitutes a failure to maintain the Premises in a condition fit for human habitation, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 CMR 410.550 (Rodent and insect infestation) and 105 CMR 410.000 provisions requiring that the owner maintain the premises free from infestation.

34. Under 105 CMR 410.550, an owner is responsible for maintaining dwelling units free from rodents where two or more units are infested or where the infestation is the result of structural or building conditions, and must take adequate measures to prevent and eliminate such infestation.

35. The rodent infestation and resulting unsanitary conditions in Plaintiff’s home constitute a condition that endangers or materially impairs the health, safety, or well‑being of Plaintiff, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and relevant case law.

36. Defendant has had actual notice of the rodent infestation for at least approximately three months before the date of this Complaint.

37. Despite such actual notice and ample opportunity, Defendant has failed and refused to take the actions reasonably necessary to eliminate the rodent infestation and to keep the Premises free from such conditions.

38. Defendant’s conduct and inaction constitute a knowing or at least negligent disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant to use and quietly enjoy the Premises, including the kitchen and food preparation areas.

39. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages including, but not limited to, approximately $200 in spoiled or discarded food and approximately $80 in purchased storage containers and related protective items, totaling approximately $280.

40. Plaintiff has also suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her kitchen and emotional distress, anxiety, and discomfort from being unable to safely and comfortably cook and eat in her home.

41. The fair rental value of the Premises has been diminished by the persistent rodent infestation and unsanitary conditions.

42. At all relevant times, the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy under Massachusetts law was in effect.

43. Defendant’s actions and omissions, as described above, caused a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.


          IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
                            (G.L. c. 186, § 14)

44. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 43 as if fully set forth herein.

45. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any lessor or landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

46. Under Massachusetts law, residential tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment both by statute (G.L. c. 186, § 14) and by common law. See, e.g., Spence v. O’Brien, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983).

47. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, resulting in conditions that materially endanger or impair the health, safety, or well‑being of the tenant, can constitute an interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102‑03 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).

48. In Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s failure to take adequate action to correct serious sanitary code violations and flooding, after notice, could constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and support an award of damages for emotional distress.

49. In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court explained that a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment where its conduct or inaction causes a substantial interference with the tenant’s use of the premises, even if the landlord does not intend the result.

50. Under Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and its progeny, compliance with the State Sanitary Code is a basic obligation of residential landlords, and violations of the Code can support tenant remedies including rent abatement and damages.

51. In Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), the Court reiterated that serious or persistent sanitary code violations, when the landlord has notice and fails to correct them, can amount to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

52. Massachusetts courts have specifically recognized that rodent infestations and unsanitary conditions can constitute breaches of the warranty of habitability and quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 198‑99 (1979) (serious code violations, including vermin infestations, justify rent abatement and tenant remedies); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908‑09 (1987) (sanitary code violations give rise to damages).

53. Under 105 CMR 410.020 and related provisions, the presence of rodent infestation in residential premises is a violation of the State Sanitary Code and creates conditions that may “endanger or materially impair the health or safety and well‑being of an occupant,” which is the standard referenced in G.L. c. 186, § 14.

54. 105 CMR 410.550 (Rodent and insect infestation) requires owners to maintain the premises free from rodents and to take whatever measures are necessary to exterminate rodents and prevent reinfestation, particularly in multi‑unit buildings or where the infestation is due to structural or building conditions.

55. Defendant’s failure to comply with the State Sanitary Code and to maintain the Premises free from rodent infestation, despite notice, constitutes a violation of his statutory duty as landlord and underlies the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788‑89 (1994).

56. Defendant had actual knowledge of the rodent infestation for several months prior to the filing of this Complaint, by virtue of Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and the exterminator’s professional assessment that more comprehensive treatment was required.

57. Despite such knowledge, Defendant unreasonably limited his response to placing a few traps and arranging a single exterminator visit, and then refused to authorize further measures recommended by the exterminator, citing cost.

58. Defendant’s refusal to undertake adequate corrective measures in the face of persistent rodent infestation, contamination of Plaintiff’s food, and ongoing unsanitary conditions constitutes a “direct or indirect” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

59. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been substantial and continuous over a period of months, affecting essential aspects of her residential use, including the ability to safely store, prepare, and consume food in her own home.

60. Massachusetts courts have held that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when a landlord’s acts or omissions result in conditions that unreasonably interfere with the tenant’s comfort, repose, and use of the premises, even absent an intent to harass or evict. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716‑18; Doe v. Boston Housing Auth., 404 Mass. 710, 715‑16 (1989).

61. In addition, G.L. c. 186, § 14 has been interpreted broadly to protect tenants from serious interferences with their tenancy caused by the landlord’s failure to maintain habitable conditions when the landlord has notice and an opportunity to cure. See Al‑Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850‑53; Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

62. By reason of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (recognizing that Plaintiff is self‑represented but reserving rights should she later retain counsel).

63. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200; three months’ rent is therefore $3,600.

64. Plaintiff’s actual out‑of‑pocket damages for spoiled food and protective containers total approximately $280, and Plaintiff has also suffered non‑economic damages including anxiety, distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of her kitchen and home.

65. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of not less than three months’ rent ($3,600), plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, and any additional appropriate relief as determined by the Court.

66. To the extent the Court deems it appropriate, Plaintiff also seeks rent abatement corresponding to the diminished fair rental value of the Premises during the period of the infestation, consistent with Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).


                               V. DAMAGES

67. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered:

    a. Out‑of‑pocket expenses of approximately $200 for food that had to be discarded due to contamination or reasonable fear of contamination from mouse droppings and rodent activity;

    b. Out‑of‑pocket expenses of approximately $80 for plastic containers and other items purchased to protect food and attempt to mitigate the infestation, for a total of approximately $280 in direct pecuniary loss;

    c. Loss of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly the kitchen and food preparation areas, during the period of the infestation;

    d. Anxiety, emotional distress, and discomfort associated with living in a rodent‑infested environment and being unable to safely and comfortably cook and eat in her home;

    e. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises for the period during which the infestation persisted, in an amount to be determined at trial;

    f. Statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount not less than three months’ rent ($3,600), plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

68. Plaintiff currently estimates her out‑of‑pocket monetary damages at approximately $280 and seeks such damages as part of the overall statutory and compensatory relief available under G.L. c. 186, § 14.


                            VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant James McAllister, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 by failing to take adequate measures to abate the rodent infestation and maintain the Premises in a safe and sanitary condition, despite notice;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount equal to the greater of Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, i.e., not less than $3,600;

C. An award of Plaintiff’s actual damages, including but not limited to approximately $280 in out‑of‑pocket expenses for spoiled food and protective containers, and damages for loss of use and enjoyment and emotional distress in an amount to be determined by the Court;

D. An award of rent abatement and/or diminution in value damages for the period during which the rodent infestation and unsanitary conditions persisted, in an amount to be determined by the Court;

E. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable court rules;

F. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, should Plaintiff later retain counsel;

G. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.


                           VII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
