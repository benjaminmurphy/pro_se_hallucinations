CIVIL ACTION NO. __________


COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)


Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, for her Complaint against Defendant, Mark Thompson, states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Collins (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing at 125 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103.

2. Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), is an individual and the owner and/or manager of the residential rental property located at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01103 (the “Premises”), where Plaintiff resides as a tenant.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought in the Housing Court Department, Springfield Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 5, which grant the Housing Court jurisdiction over civil actions involving residential housing, including claims arising out of landlord‑tenant relationships and breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5. Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, § 8; G.L. c. 185C, § 4.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.

7. Under the tenancy agreement, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant.

8. Plaintiff has timely paid, or stood ready, willing, and able to pay, all rent due under the tenancy during the period relevant to this Complaint.

9. Plaintiff used one of the two bedrooms in the Premises as a home office for her work. The second bedroom was an essential part of the value of the tenancy for Plaintiff, as it provided a dedicated workspace that allowed her to work from home.

10. Approximately six weeks prior to the date of this Complaint, in or about mid‑October 2025, the electrical service to one of the bedrooms in the Premises (the bedroom Plaintiff used as a home office) failed.

11. Specifically, in that bedroom, all electrical outlets ceased functioning and the overhead light fixture no longer operated.

12. The rest of the apartment retained electrical service, but the affected bedroom became entirely unusable due to the lack of power and lighting.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of electrical service in that bedroom.

14. Defendant sent an electrician to the Premises. The electrician informed Plaintiff, and upon information and belief informed Defendant, that the wiring problem in that bedroom would require a more extensive repair to fix properly.

15. Defendant has acknowledged to Plaintiff that the repair is needed, but has stated that the repair is “complicated” due to the building’s old wiring and that he is “getting quotes” for the work.

16. Despite having actual notice of the loss of electrical service and the need for repair, Defendant has failed, for approximately six weeks, to restore electrical service to the affected bedroom.

17. As a result, Plaintiff has been entirely unable to use that bedroom, and in particular has been unable to use it as a home office.

18. Because she can no longer work from the bedroom office space, Plaintiff has been forced to conduct her work in public spaces such as coffee shops and in a coworking facility.

19. Plaintiff has incurred out‑of‑pocket expenses of approximately $15 per workday for coffee and food at coffee shops, solely to have somewhere to sit and work because her bedroom office is unusable.

20. Plaintiff has also been required to purchase a coworking space membership at a cost of approximately $150 per month in order to have a functional workspace.

21. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to repair the electrical defect and restore the use of the bedroom, Plaintiff’s office furniture, work materials, and other belongings have been crammed into the living room of the Premises.

22. The displacement of the office use from the bedroom into the living room has substantially interfered with the normal, comfortable use of the living room and has negatively affected Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the apartment as a whole.

23. The complete lack of electrical service in the bedroom for an extended period of about six weeks has rendered that room uninhabitable and unfit for its ordinary purposes.

24. Electricity is a basic and essential service and utility that must be provided and maintained by a residential landlord in Massachusetts as part of the implied warranty of habitability and statutory duties under the State Sanitary Code and related regulations. See, e.g., G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. § 410.351 (requiring provision of electrical service and maintenance in safe working order).

25. Defendant’s failure to correct the electrical defect in the bedroom for an extended period, after notice and an opportunity to repair, constitutes a substantial and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

26. Plaintiff has suffered financial losses, inconvenience, distress, and loss of use of a significant portion of the Premises as a direct result of Defendant’s failure to restore electrical service.

27. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has been damaged in at least the amount of $900, representing a combination of rent‑based damages and consequential losses for alternative workspace and related expenses attributable to the unusable bedroom and the substantial interference with her tenancy.

28. At all relevant times, Defendant has had the ability, through reasonable diligence and expense, to engage qualified professionals to repair and restore electrical service to the bedroom, but has failed and refused to do so in a timely manner.

29. Defendant’s conduct and inaction, in light of his actual knowledge of the defect and its effect on Plaintiff’s use of a significant portion of the Premises, constitutes at least a negligent, if not willful, disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory and common‑law rights to quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

30. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and a landlord who does so “shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

32. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, is read into every residential tenancy in Massachusetts, whether written or oral. See, e.g.:

   a. **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.,** 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994) (recognizing scope of statutory quiet enjoyment);  
   b. **Lowery v. Robinson,** 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982) (quiet enjoyment covenant implied and enforceable in residential leases).

33. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when there is a serious or substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See:

   a. **Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis,** 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (substantial interference standard; landlord liability for conditions they fail to remedy);  
   b. **Blackett v. Olanoff,** 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977) (landlord liable where conditions substantially impair tenant’s enjoyment, even absent specific intent);  
   c. **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas,** 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994) (quiet enjoyment breach where landlord fails to correct serious conditions);  
   d. **Simon v. Solomon,** 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982) (repeated flooding and failure to repair constituted substantial interference and breach of quiet enjoyment).

34. A landlord’s failure, after notice, to correct serious housing defects within the landlord’s control, including defects impacting utilities such as electricity, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See:

   a. **Hemingway v. Boston Hous. Auth.,** 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973) (failure to repair substandard conditions; breach of habitability and related landlord duties);  
   b. **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson,** 379 Mass. 196, 201–03 (1979) (landlord’s failure to remedy code violations and defective conditions may result in liability and rent abatement).

35. Massachusetts courts have recognized that a landlord’s inaction in the face of known, ongoing conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises may constitute “indirect interference” cognizable under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Al‑Ziab,** 424 Mass. at 850–51; **Blackett,** 371 Mass. at 718–19.

36. At all relevant times, Defendant had actual notice that the bedroom in Plaintiff’s apartment had no electrical service, rendering it unusable, and that this condition had persisted for weeks.

37. Defendant’s failure and refusal, over a period of approximately six weeks, to restore electrical service to the affected bedroom, despite notice and the availability of professional repair, constitutes a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of a material portion of the Premises.

38. Defendant’s inaction has effectively deprived Plaintiff of the use of one of the apartment’s two bedrooms and the home office function for which Plaintiff reasonably relied upon that room, thereby substantially diminishing the value of the tenancy to Plaintiff.

39. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is continuing, as of the filing of this Complaint, because the electrical service has not been restored and the bedroom remains unusable.

40. The State Sanitary Code and related regulations require that landlords provide and maintain safe and functional electrical service. See, e.g.:

   a. G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L (authorizing promulgation and enforcement of sanitary code);  
   b. 105 C.M.R. 410.351 (requiring adequate electrical facilities and wiring maintained in good working order);  
   c. 105 C.M.R. 410.200 et seq. (landlord responsibilities for maintenance of essential facilities).

   While Plaintiff’s sole cause of action here is for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant’s failure to comply with these obligations underscores the seriousness of the interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises. See **Hemingway,** 363 Mass. at 199–201; **Cruz Mgmt.,** 417 Mass. at 789–90.

41. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as alleged above, constitute at least a negligent, and in light of the ongoing nature and Defendant’s continuing inaction, arguably a willful, violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Al‑Ziab,** 424 Mass. at 850–51 (landlord liable under § 14 where conduct is at least negligent); **Simon,** 385 Mass. at 102–04.

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use of one of the two bedrooms in the Premises for approximately six weeks (and continuing);  
   b. Diminution in the value of the tenancy due to the deprivation of a functional bedroom and home office;  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses reasonably incurred for alternative workspace, including daily expenditures at coffee shops (approximately $15 per day) and a coworking membership of approximately $150 per month; and  
   d. Inconvenience, disruption, and distress arising from the dislocation of Plaintiff’s work and the crowding of office equipment into the living room, making the apartment substantially less livable.

43. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Although Plaintiff appears pro se at this time, she reserves her right to seek reasonable attorney’s fees should she later obtain counsel.

44. Plaintiff reasonably values her damages at not less than $900 at this time, and she seeks all remedies available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to statutory minimum damages of three months’ rent if greater than her actual and consequential damages, as well as court costs.

D. An order that Defendant immediately and properly repair and restore electrical service to the affected bedroom at the Premises and otherwise refrain from further interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises;

E. An award of costs of this action, including filing and service costs, as permitted under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

F. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 should Plaintiff later retain counsel and incur such fees; and

G. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
