Those particular factors come from other authorities (e.g., G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 31 and Custody of a Minor). Hugo focuses on deference to the trial judge and the weighing of expert and lay evidence, not on setting out a specific factor test of the type described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cOnce the judge concluded that parental unfitness was established, he correctly determined that the central question was whether it was in Hugo\u2019s best interests to remain with his foster mother or to be transferred to the care and custody of his aunt. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (c). The \u2018best interests of a child\u2019 is a question that presents the trial judge \u2018with a classic example of a discretionary decision.\u2019 \u2026 We recognize that in this field it is neither possible nor desirable to make decisions with precision, and that \u2018much must be left to the trial judge\u2019s experience and judgment.\u2019\u201d"
