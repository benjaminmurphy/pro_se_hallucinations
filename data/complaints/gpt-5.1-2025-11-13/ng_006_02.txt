### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY – BICYCLE “DOORING” COLLISION)

Plaintiff Alex Rivera (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Jordan Smith (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Alex Rivera is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff was a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Jordan Smith is an individual who resides in Massachusetts and, at all times relevant, operated a motor vehicle in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action seeking monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage arising from Defendant’s negligence in operating and exiting a motor vehicle in Boston, Massachusetts.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the cause of action arose in Suffolk County, specifically at or near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant resides in Massachusetts and/or regularly operates a motor vehicle within the Commonwealth, and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately 8:00 a.m. (or such other time as may be shown at trial), Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bicycle lane on Commonwealth Avenue, near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, in Boston, Massachusetts.

8. Commonwealth Avenue is a public roadway in the City of Boston, subject to the traffic laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including, but not limited to, G.L. c. 89, G.L. c. 90, and G.L. c. 85.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating the bicycle in a safe, prudent, and lawful manner, keeping within the marked bicycle lane, traveling in the proper direction of traffic, and obeying all applicable traffic controls.

10. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet and otherwise taking reasonable precautions for personal safety.

11. At the same date and time, Defendant was operating or had just operated a motor vehicle, believed to be used for rideshare purposes, and had parked or stopped the vehicle in or near a designated loading zone immediately adjacent to the bicycle lane at or near 1234 Commonwealth Avenue.

12. Defendant was parked or standing with the vehicle parallel to the curb, on the right side of the roadway, immediately beside the marked bicycle lane used by cyclists such as Plaintiff.

13. Without first determining that it was reasonably safe to do so, and without keeping a proper lookout for traffic, including a reasonably foreseeable bicyclist traveling in the adjacent bicycle lane, Defendant suddenly and forcefully opened the driver’s-side door of the vehicle into the bicycle lane.

14. Defendant failed to check mirrors, failed to look over his shoulder, and failed to ascertain whether any cyclist was approaching from behind before opening the door into the path of traffic.

15. Plaintiff was riding lawfully in the bicycle lane and had no reasonable opportunity to stop, swerve, or otherwise avoid the unexpected obstruction of the door suddenly swinging into the lane immediately in front of Plaintiff’s path.

16. Plaintiff’s bicycle struck the edge of the open driver’s-side door. The impact caused Plaintiff to be thrown from the bicycle and to land violently on the pavement.

17. As a direct and proximate result of the collision, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including but not limited to:  
    a. Road rash, abrasions, and contusions to the arms and legs; and  
    b. A chipped front tooth requiring dental treatment.

18. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and significantly damaged in the collision, rendering it unsafe and unusable for continued commuting and requiring replacement.

19. At the scene of the incident, Defendant admitted to Plaintiff, in substance, that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at or checking his phone, and that he opened the door without seeing Plaintiff.

20. Defendant’s on‑scene admission that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was on his phone evidences Defendant’s inattention and failure to keep a proper lookout for other lawful users of the roadway, including bicyclists.

21. Subsequently, when Plaintiff presented a claim to Defendant’s motor vehicle liability insurer, Plaintiff was informed that Defendant had changed his version of the events and falsely claimed that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

22. Plaintiff was not weaving in and out of traffic and, at all relevant times, remained within the marked bicycle lane in a safe and predictable manner.

23. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was on the way to work, and as a result of the collision, Plaintiff missed work and lost approximately $800.00 in wages.

24. Plaintiff incurred medical and dental expenses of approximately $2,500.00 for treatment of the injuries sustained in the collision, and reasonably anticipates additional medical, dental, and/or related expenses in the future.

25. Plaintiff also incurred costs to repair or replace the damaged bicycle and related equipment, and is entitled to recover such property damages in an amount to be proven at trial.

26. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff experienced physical pain, emotional distress, inconvenience, interference with activities of daily living, and a loss or diminution of enjoyment of life.

27. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a lawful user of the adjacent bicycle lane and public way, to exercise reasonable care in the operation, stopping, standing, and exiting of Defendant’s motor vehicle, including the opening of vehicle doors into an area of foreseeable bicycle traffic.

28. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things, failing to maintain a proper lookout, failing to yield to bicyclists in the bicycle lane, opening a door into the lane without first ascertaining that it was safe to do so, and by being distracted by use of a cell phone at or immediately before opening his door.

29. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages, and there was no contributory negligence on the part of Plaintiff.

30. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligent conduct and reasonably relied upon other users of the roadway, including Defendant, to comply with Massachusetts traffic and safety laws.

---

### IV. LEGAL BASIS – NEGLIGENCE UNDER MASSACHUSETTS LAW

31. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–30 as though fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts common law, a driver or occupant of a motor vehicle owes a duty to exercise reasonable care toward all foreseeable users of the highway, including bicyclists using a marked bike lane. See, e.g., **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696–98 (2000) (discussing duty of reasonable care owed by motorists to others on roadway); **Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.**, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902–03 (1987) (general negligence principles).

33. Negligence in Massachusetts is established where the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care, breached that duty, and such breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries and damages. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); **Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.**, 389 Mass. 47, 56 (1983).

34. Massachusetts statutes and regulations further define and reinforce the duty owed by motorists and vehicle occupants when opening doors into areas of traffic. Specifically, G.L. c. 90, § 14 provides in relevant part that:  
   “No person shall open a door on a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists, or leave a door open on the side of a vehicle available to moving traffic for a period of time longer than necessary to load or unload passengers.”  

   This provision expressly contemplates the safety of bicyclists and codifies a standard of care applicable to Defendant’s conduct.

35. Under G.L. c. 89, §§ 1–4B, and G.L. c. 90, §§ 14 and 17, motorists must operate and act with due care so as not to endanger the lives or safety of any person lawfully using the roadway, including those in designated bicycle lanes.

36. The violation of a safety statute designed to protect the class of persons of which Plaintiff is a member (bicyclists), such as G.L. c. 90, § 14, may be considered evidence of negligence. See **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 359 (1990) (statutory violation as evidence of negligence); **LaClair v. Silberline Mfg. Co.**, 379 Mass. 21, 28–29 (1979).

37. As a bicyclist riding in a marked bike lane adjacent to Defendant’s vehicle, Plaintiff was within the class of persons the statute was designed to protect, and the type of harm suffered—collision with a suddenly opened vehicle door—was precisely the type of harm the statute seeks to prevent.

38. Massachusetts case law recognizes that motorists and others using public ways must anticipate the presence of cyclists and act with reasonable care toward them. See, e.g., **Commonwealth v. Campbell**, 394 Mass. 77, 86 (1985) (discussing duty of due care to others on the roadway); **Irwin v. Ware**, 392 Mass. 745, 756–57 (1984) (foreseeability and duty in roadway‑related injuries).

39. A driver’s or occupant’s distraction caused by the use of a cell phone or other device does not excuse the failure to maintain a proper lookout and comply with duties under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., **Mass. Gen. Laws c. 90, § 13B** (restricting handheld mobile device use while operating a motor vehicle, reflecting legislative concern over distraction and roadway safety).

40. Under G.L. c. 85, § 11B, bicycles are permitted on most public ways, and bicyclists are generally afforded the rights and subject to the duties of drivers of vehicles, further establishing that Plaintiff was lawfully present and entitled to protection as a roadway user.

41. The presence of a marked bicycle lane on Commonwealth Avenue emphasizes that bicyclists are a foreseeable and expected part of traffic, and that motorists and occupants must account for cyclists’ presence when stopping, standing, and opening doors. See **Hudson v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 481 Mass. 282, 286–87 (2019) (recognizing duties arising from foreseeable users of transportation ways); **Lyon v. Morphew**, 424 Mass. 828, 832 (1997) (duty to those foreseeably at risk).

42. Under Massachusetts comparative negligence law, G.L. c. 231, § 85, a plaintiff’s recovery is not barred unless the plaintiff’s negligence exceeds that of the defendant. Plaintiff denies any negligence and, in any event, Plaintiff’s share of causal fault, if any, was far less than that of Defendant.

43. To the extent Defendant or his insurer alleges that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” Plaintiff specifically denies this allegation and asserts that it is contrary to Defendant’s earlier on‑scene admission and to the physical facts of the collision. Disputed issues of witness credibility are for the trier of fact. See **O’Connor v. Raymark Indus., Inc.**, 401 Mass. 586, 589 (1988).

---

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

44. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–43 as though fully set forth herein.

45. At all times relevant, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation, parking, and exiting of his motor vehicle, including the opening of vehicle doors, so as not to unreasonably endanger or interfere with other lawful users of the road, including bicyclists in the adjacent bike lane.

46. Defendant breached this duty of care, including but not limited to the following acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to keep a proper lookout for bicyclists traveling lawfully in the adjacent bicycle lane;  
   b. Failing to check his mirrors and observe oncoming bicycle traffic prior to opening the driver’s‑side door;  
   c. Opening the door into an active lane of bicycle traffic when it was not reasonably safe to do so;  
   d. Failing to comply with G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related provisions governing safe opening of vehicle doors and consideration of bicyclists;  
   e. Becoming distracted by checking or using a cell phone at or around the time of opening the door instead of paying attention to traffic conditions;  
   f. Failing to appreciate the foreseeable risk that a bicyclist would be traveling in the marked bicycle lane adjacent to his vehicle; and  
   g. Failing to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.

47. Defendant’s violations of G.L. c. 90, § 14, and other applicable safety statutes and regulations constitute evidence of negligence and, together with his common‑law breaches of duty, establish liability for Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff was thrown from his bicycle, suffered physical injuries and property damage, and incurred medical and dental expenses, lost wages, and other losses as described herein.

49. Plaintiff’s damages include, but are not limited to:

   a. Medical and dental expenses of approximately $2,500.00 to date, with additional medical, dental, or related care reasonably anticipated in the future;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $800.00 arising from missed work days due to the incident and recovery time;  
   c. Damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle, including a bent and compromised frame and related components, requiring replacement or substantial repair;  
   d. Out‑of‑pocket expenses related to transportation and other costs incurred as a result of being unable to use the bicycle for commuting;  
   e. Physical pain, suffering, and discomfort associated with road rash, abrasions, and the dental injury;  
   f. Emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience arising from the collision, medical treatment, and disruption of daily activities; and  
   g. Loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of the ability to engage in recreational and commuting bicycling and other normal activities.

50. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent conduct, including the sudden and unsafe opening of a vehicle door into a marked bicycle lane and the failure to pay adequate attention to traffic conditions while distracted by a phone.

51. Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent to bringing this action, to the extent any such conditions are applicable, or such conditions have been waived or excused.

### VI. DAMAGES

52. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–51 as though fully set forth herein.

53. Plaintiff seeks recovery of all damages available under Massachusetts law for personal injury and property damage caused by negligence, including but not limited to:

   a. Reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses incurred and to be incurred;  
   b. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity;  
   c. Property damage to the bicycle and related equipment;  
   d. Pain and suffering, physical and mental;  
   e. Emotional distress and mental anguish;  
   f. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with usual activities; and  
   g. All other damages permitted by Massachusetts law.

54. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B and 6C, Plaintiff also seeks prejudgment and post‑judgment interest on any verdict, award, or judgment in this action, at the statutory rate.

55. The total amount of damages will be determined by the jury, but Plaintiff reasonably believes that the damages exceed the jurisdictional minimum of this Court and, upon information and belief, exceed $25,000.00.
