    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jasmine Reed (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jasmine Reed is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (“Premises”). Plaintiff is and at all relevant times has been a residential tenant at the Premises.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual, on information and belief residing in Massachusetts, and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental property located at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been responsible for the ownership, operation, management, and maintenance of the Premises, including the heating system serving Plaintiff’s apartment.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, arising out of conditions and conduct affecting Plaintiff’s residential tenancy in Boston (Dorchester neighborhood).

5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3, and 20, because this action concerns a residential tenancy and property located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

6. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, is approximately $1,200, within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,800, payable to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff’s tenancy has been a residential tenancy for her personal and family use.

10. As landlord, Defendant is required under Massachusetts law to provide and maintain heat in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; 105 C.M.R. 410.201 (requiring heat during the heating season sufficient to maintain minimum indoor temperatures).

11. During the winter of 2024–2025 (including December 2024 through approximately March 2025), the heating system for Plaintiff’s apartment repeatedly malfunctioned.

12. Plaintiff’s heat did not completely shut off, but during cold weather, primarily in the evenings and night hours, the temperature in the apartment would repeatedly drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for periods of several hours at a time.

13. These low temperatures occurred on numerous occasions over the course of the winter heating season, rendering the apartment unreasonably cold and uncomfortable and below what is required by the State Sanitary Code and by ordinary standards of habitability.

14. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the recurring heating problems. In response, Defendant sent repair personnel to the Premises on two separate occasions during the winter.

15. After the first repair visit, the heat functioned adequately for approximately one week, after which the same pattern of temperature drops reoccurred.

16. After the second repair visit, the repair person informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and indicated that there was “not much more to do,” even though the recurring heat drops continued.

17. Despite notice of continuing problems and the inadequacy of the repairs, Defendant failed to ensure that the heating system reliably maintained legally required and reasonable temperatures in Plaintiff’s apartment throughout the heating season.

18. Because of the recurring loss of adequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and use two electric space heaters in order to keep the apartment livable.

19. The use of space heaters substantially increased Plaintiff’s utility costs, adding approximately $150 per month to her electric bill during the affected months.

20. Plaintiff also developed bronchitis in or about January 2025. Her medical provider advised that the cold indoor air likely contributed to or worsened her illness.

21. As a result of this illness, Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred out‑of‑pocket expenses, including the cost of antibiotics and related medical care.

22. At all relevant times, Plaintiff used the Premises in a reasonable, lawful, and normal manner and did not cause or contribute to the heating defects.

23. Defendant has asserted that the heat is “working” because it never went completely out and the building was not “freezing.” Nevertheless, the repeated and substantial drops in temperature to approximately 60 degrees for hours at a time made the apartment unreasonably cold and interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

24. The repeated heating failures and Defendant’s failure to permanently correct them caused Plaintiff substantial discomfort, loss of use and enjoyment of her home, increased utility expenses, and physical illness and related losses.

25. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent during the affected period.

26. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $1,200 in actual monetary damages, including increased utility costs and medical‑related losses, in addition to non‑economic harm such as discomfort, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

27. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–26 as if fully set forth herein.

28. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not, directly or indirectly, interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. A landlord’s failure to maintain essential services such as heat, after notice and within a reasonable time, can constitute such an interference.

29. Massachusetts law implies in every residential lease a covenant of quiet enjoyment and a warranty of habitability, which includes the duty to provide heat sufficient to comply with the State Sanitary Code and to maintain the premises in a condition fit for human habitation. See, e.g., *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).

30. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.201, requires landlords to provide heating facilities during the heating season capable of maintaining minimum indoor temperatures in dwelling units. Failure to meet Sanitary Code requirements can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–201; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

31. Landlords are strictly liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment, without the need to prove that the landlord acted with malice or bad faith. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977).

32. A landlord’s failure to make effective repairs to known serious conditions, resulting in continued or repeated loss or insufficiency of essential services, constitutes “interference” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

33. Here, Defendant knew or should have known that Plaintiff’s apartment was experiencing recurring heat failures and substantial temperature drops below sanitary and reasonable levels during the winter heating season.

34. Defendant’s efforts to repair the heating system were inadequate and failed to correct the ongoing problem, allowing the condition to persist over an extended period of time.

35. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning heating system in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, after notice and over an extended period, caused a substantial and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 718–19; *Simon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03.

36. The repeated exposure to cold temperatures forced Plaintiff to rely on space heaters, increased her utility expenses, caused or aggravated illness, and made parts of the Premises uncomfortable and, at times, effectively unusable for normal living, sleep, and daily activities.

37. The interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home was substantial, not trivial or de minimis, and persisted through a significant portion of the heating season. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994) (substantial interference standard); *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 200–01.

38. Defendant’s conduct and omissions violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law. See, e.g., *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51; *Lowery*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 198–201.

39. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: increased utility bills (approximately $150 per month for several winter months); lost wages for days of work missed due to illness; medical and prescription costs related to bronchitis; and non‑economic damages for discomfort, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises. See *Simon*, 385 Mass. at 102–06 (recognizing recovery for emotional distress and discomfort under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

40. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any are incurred). See also *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 200–01.

41. Three months’ rent at Plaintiff’s rental rate of $1,800 per month equals $5,400. Plaintiff’s actual damages are presently estimated at approximately $1,200. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is therefore entitled to not less than three months’ rent as statutory damages, plus costs, and such further relief as the Court deems just.
