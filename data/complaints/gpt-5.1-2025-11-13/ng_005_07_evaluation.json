The opinion narrows, rather than expands, landowners\u2019 duties with respect to adjacent public roads and emphasizes that the Commonwealth, not the private entity, controls the highway.

The court further distinguishes purely economic loss absent physical damage (not recoverable) from economic loss that is consequential to physical property damage (recoverable to the extent of loss of use).
