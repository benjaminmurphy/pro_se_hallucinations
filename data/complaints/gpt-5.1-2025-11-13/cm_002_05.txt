IN THE MATTER OF:  

SOPHIE DAVIS, a minor  

by  

JESSICA TAYLOR,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL DAVIS,  
Defendant.  

-----------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)  
-----------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Davis (date of birth omitted here for privacy), age 8.

2. The Defendant, Michael Davis (“Father”), upon information and belief, currently resides, or intends imminently to reside, in the State of New Hampshire, having previously resided in or near Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The minor child, Sophie Davis (“Sophie” or “the child”), has resided in Massachusetts for substantially all of her life and currently attends school in or near Cambridge, Massachusetts.

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters concerning Sophie pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, M.G.L. c. 209B, as well as the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C. § 1738A), because Massachusetts is and has been the child’s home state.

5. On or about March 15, 2021, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, Cambridge, Massachusetts, entered a Judgment and/or Order concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time for Sophie (the “Existing Custody Order”).

6. Under the Existing Custody Order, Mother has primary physical custody of Sophie, while Father has parenting time on Wednesdays and on alternating weekends. The parenting schedule was expressly or implicitly premised on both parents residing in relative proximity in the Cambridge area and Sophie attending a local Cambridge-area school.

7. This is a Complaint for Modification brought pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related Massachusetts case law, seeking modification of the Existing Custody Order as it relates to the parenting-time schedule, based on a material and substantial change in circumstances and the best interests of the child.

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS: MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. At the time the Existing Custody Order was entered on March 15, 2021, both Mother and Father resided in or near Cambridge, Massachusetts, at a relatively short distance from one another and from Sophie’s school.

9. The parenting plan adopted at that time—which includes a midweek overnight on Wednesdays with Father and alternating weekend parenting time—was reasonable and workable under those circumstances because it assumed:
   a. short travel times between parents’ homes;  
   b. minimal disruption to Sophie’s sleep and school schedule; and  
   c. continuity in her participation in local after‑school and extracurricular activities.

10. Since entry of the Existing Custody Order, circumstances have materially and substantially changed. Father now seeks, and/or has commenced steps, to relocate his residence to New Hampshire for a job opportunity, while still attempting to maintain the existing parenting schedule without alteration.

11. The anticipated or actual relocation of Father to New Hampshire significantly increases the distance between households and between Father’s residence and Sophie’s school, such that routine travel from Cambridge to Father’s new residence in New Hampshire is approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in typical traffic conditions.

12. The continuation of a midweek overnight (Wednesday) parenting time in New Hampshire, followed by Sophie’s return to school in Cambridge the following morning, would require:
   a. a lengthy commute of approximately ninety (90) minutes each way on a school night;  
   b. waking Sophie substantially earlier than her usual school-day schedule; and  
   c. regularly arriving home late on Wednesday nights, reducing time for homework, proper rest, and normal bedtime routines.

13. The increased distance and travel time have already begun to affect Sophie adversely. She has exhibited anxiety about the long drives, has expressed worry and distress about missing or being late to her after‑school activities, and has been concerned about being tired for school the next day.

14. Mother has observed that Sophie’s anxiety manifests in the form of:
   a. verbal expressions of dread about the long drives and disrupted schedule;  
   b. heightened emotional distress when discussing upcoming midweek visits involving long travel; and  
   c. difficulty winding down and going to sleep on nights associated with extended commutes.

15. If the current schedule remains unchanged while Father resides in New Hampshire, Sophie’s regular weekly routine would be substantially disrupted, including but not limited to:
   a. decreased time available for homework and studying on Wednesdays;  
   b. compromised participation in after-school activities, clubs, sports, or enrichment programs;  
   c. reduced sleep and rest, including earlier wake‑up times on Thursday mornings; and  
   d. increased stress and fatigue which may affect her educational progress, emotional regulation, and overall wellbeing.

16. These developments—specifically, Father’s relocation or intended relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting burdens on Sophie’s school‑week schedule and emotional health—constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not contemplated when the Existing Custody Order was entered on March 15, 2021.

17. Mother does not seek to restrict Father’s relationship with Sophie nor to interfere with meaningful parenting time. Rather, Mother seeks an adjustment to the schedule so that parenting time is exercised in a manner that is consistent with Sophie’s best interests, developmental needs, and practical realities of distance and school obligations.

18. Mother has proposed eliminating the midweek overnight given the increased distance and instead adjusting weekend parenting time and/or arranging for alternate reasonable parenting opportunities that do not impose frequent, lengthy midweek commutes on the child.

19. Maintaining the Existing Custody Order without modification in the face of Father’s relocation would undermine Sophie’s stability and welfare, contrary to the governing standard of the “best interests of the child” under Massachusetts law.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD

20. Massachusetts law provides that a court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time judgment upon a showing of a “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” and where modification is in the “best interests of the child.” See M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

21. In *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), the Supreme Judicial Court held that the Probate and Family Court may modify custody or parenting time when a material change of circumstances has occurred since the prior order and where modification is necessary to serve the child’s best interests.

22. Massachusetts courts consistently emphasize that the “paramount concern” in custody and parenting matters is the best interests of the child. *Silvia v. Silvia*, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 342 (1980); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402–03 (1981); *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981).

23. In determining best interests and whether modification is appropriate, the Court considers, among other factors, the child’s emotional and physical needs, stability and continuity of care, the effect of changes in residence or schooling, and the impact of parental decisions on the child’s daily life. See *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710–12 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–85 (2006); *M.G.L. c. 208, § 31*.

24. While *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), address removal and relocation, they underscore the need to weigh the child’s relationship with each parent, educational stability, and the practical effect of geography on parenting time—considerations that are equally relevant to a request to modify parenting schedules in light of a parent’s relocation.

25. In *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015), the Appeals Court acknowledged that a material change may arise when post‑judgment developments—such as relocation or shifts in logistical realities—render the existing parenting plan impracticable or inconsistent with the child’s best interests.

26. Massachusetts courts have recognized that repeated, lengthy travel and disruption of a child’s routine can be detrimental, and that parenting plans must be tailored to the child’s age, schooling, and developmental needs. See *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 908 (2005) (decision focusing on the practical realities of parenting time and child’s schedule); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript) (emphasizing need to adapt custody and visitation to serve best interests).

27. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court has authority to “make such judgment as it considers appropriate” regarding the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children upon a showing of changed circumstances. Similar authority exists in actions involving nonmarital children under M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

28. M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 defines “shared legal custody,” “sole legal custody,” “shared physical custody,” and “sole physical custody” and affirms that any custody or visitation order must promote the child’s welfare and development; any schedule that unduly disrupts schooling, sleep, or emotional health may be altered accordingly.

29. Under these statutes and cases, the Mother bears the burden of demonstrating that (a) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Custody Order; and (b) the requested modification is in Sophie’s best interests. Mother satisfies both elements here.

### IV. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

30. Father’s relocation or intended relocation to New Hampshire—which significantly alters the geographic proximity between the households and between Father’s residence and Sophie’s school—constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances not anticipated at the time of the 2021 judgment. See *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 151–52; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

31. Under the new circumstances, strict adherence to the existing midweek overnight schedule would predictably result in:
   a. prolonged travel times during school nights;  
   b. chronic reduction in Sophie’s sleep and rest;  
   c. interference with homework, after‑school activities, and social development; and  
   d. increased emotional stress and anxiety, as already observed.

32. These detrimental effects implicate Sophie’s educational performance, physical health, emotional security, and overall wellbeing—core components of the “best interests” analysis under *Silvia v. Silvia*, 9 Mass. App. Ct. at 342; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 402–03; and M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31.

33. The Court is not required to wait until Sophie’s academic performance or mental health measurably declines before acting. Where the evidence shows that the current order, in light of new circumstances, is reasonably likely to harm the child’s well‑being, modification is both appropriate and necessary. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

34. Consistent with *Yannas* and *Mason*, the Court must balance the child’s relationship with each parent against logistical realities and the practical effect of distance on the child’s daily life. Here, the continuation of frequent midweek overnights at a great distance from school imposes burdens on Sophie far disproportionate to any benefit of preserving the midweek overnight in its current form.

35. The requested modification—removing the midweek overnight and reasonably restructuring weekend parenting time—is narrowly tailored to preserve Father’s meaningful relationship and substantial parenting time with Sophie while preventing predictable, ongoing harm to her educational, emotional, and physical wellbeing.

36. The proposed modification respects Sophie’s need for stability in schooling and routine, which Massachusetts courts have recognized as highly significant in custody and parenting‑time decisions. See *M.G.L. c. 208, § 31*; *Silvia v. Silvia*, 9 Mass. App. Ct. at 342; *Rosenwasser*, 63 Mass. App. Ct. at 908.

37. Thus, in light of the material change in circumstances and in order to protect and promote Sophie’s best interests, the Existing Custody Order should be modified to:
   a. eliminate the midweek overnight parenting time with Father while he resides at such a distance; and  
   b. adjust and clarify weekend and/or holiday/summer schedules to maintain a strong parent‑child relationship with Father in a developmentally appropriate way.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

38. Mother respectfully requests that the Court enter an order modifying the Existing Custody Order dated March 15, 2021, as follows (or in substantially similar form):

   a. **Elimination of Midweek Overnight:**  
      The Wednesday overnight parenting time with Father shall be removed while Father’s primary residence is at a distance that would require more than approximately one hour of one‑way travel between Sophie’s school and Father’s residence.

   b. **Alternative Midweek Contact (Non‑Overnight):**  
      To the extent feasible without significant disruption to Sophie’s after‑school activities, Mother is amenable to Father exercising reasonable midweek contact that does not require an overnight—such as a weekday dinner visit in the Cambridge area, or video/telephone contact at a mutually convenient time—provided it does not interfere with Sophie’s homework, bedtime, or scheduled activities.

   c. **Adjustment of Weekend Parenting Time:**  
      The alternating weekend parenting schedule shall be maintained or, if the Court finds it appropriate, slightly expanded or adjusted to allow Father compensatory or additional weekend time in order to preserve a meaningful relationship with Sophie in light of the removal of the midweek overnight, so long as such adjustment does not unduly burden Sophie’s schooling or activities.

   d. **Holiday and Vacation Schedule:**  
      The Court may, in its discretion, clarify or adjust holiday and school‑vacation schedules to ensure that Father has ample opportunity to spend extended, less disruptive time with Sophie (e.g., long weekends, school vacations, and/or summer weeks), in a manner that minimizes repeated long drives during the school week.

   e. **Transportation Responsibilities:**  
      The Court may allocate or adjust transportation responsibilities in a way that is equitable in light of Father’s unilateral relocation and the distance involved, such as assigning Father primary responsibility for pick‑up and drop‑off for his parenting time, absent extraordinary circumstances.

   f. **Further Orders in the Child’s Best Interests:**  
      The Court may issue such further orders and directives as it deems necessary and proper to effectuate this modification and to protect the best interests of Sophie.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Custody Order dated March 15, 2021, specifically due to Father’s relocation or intended relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting impact on Sophie’s schedule, travel, and emotional wellbeing;

2. Find that modification of the Existing Custody Order is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Davis, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and applicable case law, including but not limited to *Custody of Vaughn*, *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, *Mason v. Coleman*, *Silvia v. Silvia*, *Rolde v. Rolde*, *Murray v. Super*, and *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*;

3. Modify the Existing Custody Order to:
   a. eliminate the midweek (Wednesday) overnight parenting time with Father while he resides at or near his anticipated location in New Hampshire or any other location requiring similar extended travel;  
   b. allow for reasonable, non‑overnight midweek contact where feasible and not disruptive to Sophie’s schooling and activities;  
   c. maintain and/or reasonably adjust alternating weekend parenting time, and clarify or adjust holiday and vacation schedules, in a manner that supports and preserves Sophie’s relationship with Father without imposing repeated lengthy commutes on school nights; and  
   d. allocate transportation responsibilities fairly in light of the relocation;

4. Order that all other provisions of the March 15, 2021 judgment not inconsistent with the Court’s new orders remain in full force and effect;

5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA TAYLOR
