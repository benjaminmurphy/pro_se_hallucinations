                           COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE
                      (Jury Trial Demanded – Personal Injury)


Plaintiff Lucas Thompson (“Plaintiff”), on behalf of himself and his minor son, by way of Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”), alleges as follows:

                                I.   PARTIES

1.   Plaintiff Lucas Thompson is an individual residing in Plymouth County, Massachusetts. He is the father and natural guardian of his minor son (“Minor Child”), who was eight (8) years old at the time of the incident described below.

2.   Defendant Brockton Community Center is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts nonprofit or community-based entity that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls an after‑school program and recreational facility located at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

3.   At all relevant times, Defendant held itself out to the public, including Plaintiff, as providing supervised after‑school and recreational programming for children, including gym activities, at the above‑referenced address.

4.   At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its employees, agents, and/or apparent agents, was engaged in the business of providing childcare, youth programming, and after‑school supervision for a fee or other consideration.

                         II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.   This is a civil action for negligence seeking monetary damages in an amount within the jurisdiction of this Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 21.

6.   The incident giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

7.   Venue is proper in Brockton District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the Defendant has a usual place of business in this county and the cause of action arose here.

8.   Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant resides in, maintains a usual place of business in, and conducts substantial activities within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions alleged herein occurred within this Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

                       III.   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

9.   Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–8 as if fully restated herein.

10.  On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s Minor Child was enrolled in, and attending, an after‑school program operated by Defendant at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

11.  Defendant advertised and represented, expressly and by implication, that children in its after‑school program would be supervised at all times while in the gymnasium and other activity areas.

12.  Plaintiff reasonably relied upon Defendant’s representations regarding supervision and safety in deciding to enroll his Minor Child in the program and to allow him to attend on September 15, 2023.

13.  On September 15, 2023, during scheduled after‑school programming, Defendant’s staff brought approximately twenty (20) children, including Plaintiff’s Minor Child, into the gymnasium at the facility.

14.  At that time, Defendant’s policy and/or representation provided that there would be two staff members supervising the children in the gymnasium.

15.  Despite this policy and representation, only one staff member remained in the gymnasium; the other staff member left the gym to go to an office area to do paperwork, thereby leaving only a single distracted staff person to supervise approximately twenty children engaging in active and potentially hazardous play in a gym setting.

16.  The remaining staff member positioned herself near the bleachers, and, upon information and belief, spent substantial time looking at and using her mobile phone instead of actively supervising the children.

17.  While inadequately supervised, two older boys, approximately twelve (12) years old, began engaging in a rough “tackle” style game on the hardwood gym floor, involving physical tackling, shoving, and taking other children to the ground.

18.  The tackle game was plainly observable, ongoing, and of sufficient duration that a reasonably attentive supervisor would have observed it, intervened, and either stopped the dangerous conduct or separated the children involved.

19.  Several children, including at least one child other than Plaintiff’s Minor Child, informed the staff member that the older boys were playing roughly and tackling other kids.

20.  In response to these specific warnings, the staff member negligently dismissed the concern, stating words to the effect of “boys will be boys,” and failed to take any meaningful steps to stop, control, or supervise the rough and dangerous play.

21.  The staff member did not instruct the older boys to stop the tackle game, did not separate them from the smaller children, did not implement any safety rules, and did not otherwise provide reasonable and appropriate supervision.

22.  Plaintiff’s Minor Child, an eight‑year‑old who is small for his age, was present in close proximity to the older boys during this rough tackle game.

23.  As a direct and foreseeable consequence of the lack of supervision and failure to intervene, one of the larger, older boys tackled Plaintiff’s Minor Child with significant force, taking him down onto the hard, unpadded, hardwood gym floor.

24.  Plaintiff’s Minor Child struck his head forcefully on the floor and lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

25.  Loss of consciousness following a blow to the head is a well‑recognized sign of serious head injury and concussion, and constitutes a medical emergency.

26.  Following this incident, emergency medical care was required, and Plaintiff’s Minor Child was transported to the emergency room.

27.  At the hospital emergency department, Plaintiff’s Minor Child was diagnosed with a concussion and loss of consciousness.

28.  As a result of the incident and injury, Plaintiff’s Minor Child experienced physical pain, headaches, dizziness, confusion, and other symptoms consistent with concussion.

29.  Due to his injuries, Plaintiff’s Minor Child missed several days of school, and his normal activities were restricted upon medical advice.

30.  Plaintiff incurred medical expenses on behalf of his Minor Child relating to emergency care, diagnostic evaluation, and follow-up treatment in an amount of approximately Five Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($5,200.00), and continues to incur, or is reasonably expected to incur, additional medical and related expenses.

31.  Plaintiff also personally lost approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) in wages due to time taken off from work to care for his injured son, transport him to medical appointments, and monitor his recovery.

32.  Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, economic losses, including but not limited to medical expenses and lost wages, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.

33.  Plaintiff’s Minor Child has suffered, and may continue to suffer, physical pain, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non‑economic damages as a direct and proximate result of the September 15, 2023 incident.

34.  The dangerous roughhousing and tackle play that caused Plaintiff’s son’s injury was reasonably foreseeable to a provider of youth and after‑school recreational services, particularly where older, larger children were engaged in physical contact play with younger, smaller children on a hard surface.

35.  Defendant knew or should have known that leaving only one inattentive staff member to supervise approximately twenty children engaged in gym play, and ignoring reports of rough tackling, created an unreasonable and unacceptable risk of physical injury to the children, including Plaintiff’s Minor Child.

36.  Defendant had the ability and duty to implement reasonable safety rules for play in the gym, to prohibit tackle or rough contact play on the hard gym floor, to provide adequate supervision, and to respond promptly and appropriately to reports of dangerous conduct.

37.  Defendant’s failure to provide adequate staffing, to ensure active supervision, and to intervene when notified of dangerous behavior constituted a breach of its duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff’s Minor Child.

38.  Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s Minor Child’s fall, head impact, loss of consciousness, and concussion, and in causing Plaintiff’s related economic and non‑economic damages.

39.  At all relevant times, Defendant’s employees and agents were acting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency, such that Defendant is vicariously liable for their negligence under the doctrine of respondeat superior.

40.  Alternatively, and in addition, Defendant is directly liable for its own negligence in hiring, training, staffing, and supervising personnel, and in promulgating and enforcing (or failing to promulgate and enforce) appropriate safety and supervision policies for children in its care.

                     IV.   NEGLIGENCE (Sole Cause of Action)

41.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–40 as if fully set forth herein.

A. Duty of Care

42.  Under Massachusetts law, a person or entity that undertakes to provide childcare, after‑school programming, youth supervision, or similar services owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect children in its custody from unreasonable risk of physical harm. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence framework); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331 (1983); Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244, 435 N.E.2d 339 (1982).

43.  As an operator of an after‑school program and recreational facility, Defendant owed Plaintiff’s Minor Child a duty to exercise reasonable care in:  
     a.   supervising children in its custody;  
     b.   maintaining safe conditions for play in the gymnasium;  
     c.   adopting and enforcing safety rules appropriate to the age and abilities of the children; and  
     d.   responding reasonably to foreseeable risks and known dangerous conduct.

44.  Defendant had a special relationship with Plaintiff’s Minor Child, akin to a school‑student or custodian‑ward relationship, that created a duty to take reasonable measures for his safety while in Defendant’s care. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 51–53; Irwin v. Town of Ware, 392 Mass. 745, 467 N.E.2d 1292 (1984).

45.  Children, especially younger children, are owed an enhanced degree of care commensurate with their age, size, and known vulnerabilities. See Copithorne v. Framingham Union Hosp., 401 Mass. 860, 860–61, 519 N.E.2d 1329 (1988); Lane v. Epinard, 318 Mass. 664, 63 N.E.2d 463 (1945).

B. Breach of Duty

46.  Defendant, through its employees and agents, breached its duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff and his Minor Child, including but not limited to the following ways:

     a.   Failing to provide adequate staff supervision in the gymnasium, including permitting one staff person to leave approximately twenty children substantially unsupervised in an active play area;

     b.   Failing to ensure that the remaining staff member gave active, attentive, and continuous supervision to the children, instead permitting that person to sit near the bleachers and focus on her cellular phone;

     c.   Failing to implement and enforce reasonable rules prohibiting rough tackle play and dangerous physical contact games among children, particularly where older, larger children interacted with younger, smaller children on a hard surface;

     d.   Failing to take any corrective or protective action when informed by other children that older boys were engaging in rough tackling that posed a foreseeable risk of injury;

     e.   Minimizing and ignoring credible reports of dangerous conduct with the dismissive statement “boys will be boys,” instead of intervening promptly to stop the hazardous play;

     f.   Failing to separate younger, smaller children, including Plaintiff’s Minor Child, from older, larger children engaged in rough physical play;

     g.   Failing to adequately hire, train, and supervise staff in appropriate child supervision, risk recognition, and intervention techniques;

     h.   Failing to adhere to its own represented policies and advertised promise of “supervision at all times” for children in the gym; and

     i.   Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent after‑school program and community center would act under the same or similar circumstances.

47.  Under Massachusetts law, negligence consists of the failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 144, 849 N.E.2d 829 (2006); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696, 722 N.E.2d 971 (2000).

48.  Defendant’s above‑described conduct fell below the standard of care of a reasonably prudent youth program or community center operator, and constituted negligence.

49.  The risk that a young child could be seriously injured if older boys engaged in rough tackling games on a hard floor without adequate adult supervision was both obvious and reasonably foreseeable. See Irwin, 392 Mass. at 756–57; Mullins, 389 Mass. at 56.

50.  Defendant’s negligent conduct was not a mere error in judgment, but a systemic failure to provide the level of supervision promised to parents and required by common law.

C. Causation

51.  Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of the incident on September 15, 2023, in which Plaintiff’s Minor Child was tackled, struck his head on the hardwood floor, lost consciousness, and sustained a concussion.

52.  Had Defendant provided proper staffing, active supervision, and prompt intervention upon being warned of the rough tackle game, the tackle that injured Plaintiff’s son would not have occurred, or its severity would have been substantially diminished.

53.  Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable when its negligent conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff’s harm. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 146; Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 318–19, 771 N.E.2d 770 (2002).

54.  Plaintiff’s and his Minor Child’s injuries and damages were the natural, probable, and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.

D. Damages

55.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s Minor Child suffered bodily injuries including, but not limited to, a concussion, loss of consciousness, pain, headaches, dizziness, and other concussion‑related symptoms.

56.  Plaintiff’s Minor Child suffered and may continue to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, emotional distress, fear, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment of life.

57.  Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,200.00 for evaluation and treatment of his Minor Child’s injuries, and is reasonably likely to incur further medical expenses.

58.  Plaintiff has suffered lost wages of approximately $1,500.00 due to time taken away from work to care for his injured son and attend medical appointments.

59.  Plaintiff has suffered additional incidental and consequential expenses associated with the injury and recovery process.

60.  Defendant’s negligence has caused Plaintiff, acting on behalf of his son, to sustain damages compensable under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to those allowed under G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B & 85.

61.  To the extent, if any, comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff asserts that his Minor Child exercised the degree of care to be expected of a reasonably careful child of like age, intelligence, and experience, and that any negligence attributable to him is minimal, and in any event, Plaintiff’s recovery is governed by Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85. See Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 525 N.E.2d 1305 (1988).

62.  Plaintiff seeks all damages allowed by Massachusetts law for personal injury due to negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other damages supported by the evidence and applicable law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85; Ferriter v. Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, Inc., 381 Mass. 507, 413 N.E.2d 690 (1980).

                     V.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Lucas Thompson, on behalf of himself and his minor son, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Brockton Community Center, and award the following relief:

A.   Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but sufficient to fully and fairly compensate Plaintiff and his Minor Child for all injuries and losses suffered, including:

     1.   Past and future medical expenses related to the September 15, 2023 injury;

     2.   Past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity suffered by Plaintiff;

     3.   Pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life suffered by Plaintiff’s Minor Child;

     4.   Any other special or general damages permitted under Massachusetts law;

B.   Statutory interest on the judgment as allowed by G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C.   Costs of this action as allowed by law;

D.   Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                          VI.   JURY DEMAND

Pursuant to Massachusetts law, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable. See G.L. c. 218, § 19A; Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

                                        Respectfully submitted,

                                        PLAINTIFF,
