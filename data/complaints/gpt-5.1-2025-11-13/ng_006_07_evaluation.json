Instead, it focuses on product design negligence, adequacy of warnings, assumption of risk, and whether directed verdicts were proper based on the evidence, without articulating a broad rule about negligence/comparative fault being jury questions. The brief statement that assumption of risk is rarely decided as a matter of law is related but not the same proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "City Tank and Old Dominion also argue that their motions for directed verdicts and for judgments notwithstanding the verdicts should have been allowed because Uloth assumed the risk as matter of law.\n\nRarely, if ever, can it be said that a plaintiff has assumed the risk as matter of law.\n\n... Although his testimony concerning his awareness of the danger of the packer panel was contradictory, resolution of conflicting testimony is the jury\u2019s function."
