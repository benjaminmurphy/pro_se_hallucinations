Docket No. __________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Jessica Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Martinez”) alleges as follows against Defendant Robert Hargrove (“Defendant” or “Mr. Hargrove”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martinez is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant Robert Hargrove is an individual, on information and belief residing in Massachusetts, and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. At all times relevant, Defendant has been a “landlord” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and G.L. c. 239, and has exercised control over repairs and essential building systems at the Premises.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and § 19A, because the claims arise under Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the Premises are located in Brockton, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this division.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about April 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (the “Apartment” or “Rental Unit”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment as her home since on or about April 1, 2022.

8. Plaintiff’s current rent is $1,200 per month, payable to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has paid her rent or has been ready, willing, and able to pay rent as required by her tenancy, and has otherwise complied with her material obligations as a tenant.

10. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied warranty of habitability and an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 186, § 14.

11. Hot water is an essential service and is required in residential rental premises under G.L. c. 111, § 127A and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.190 and 410.200, which require landlords to provide a continuous supply of hot water at required temperatures.

12. On or about three weeks prior to December 1, 2025 (approximately early November 2025), the hot water in Plaintiff’s Apartment failed completely, leaving Plaintiff without hot water for bathing, washing dishes, and other ordinary household uses (the “Hot Water Failure”).

13. On the same day that Plaintiff discovered the Hot Water Failure, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant by text message and/or other communication that the Apartment had no hot water and that urgent repair was needed.

14. Defendant acknowledged the problem and told Plaintiff that the water heater required a part and that he had ordered the part.

15. Approximately one week after Plaintiff’s initial report, there was still no hot water in the Apartment.

16. Plaintiff again communicated with Defendant after that first week, and Defendant stated that the part for the water heater was “backordered.”

17. Approximately two weeks after Plaintiff’s initial report, there was still no hot water in the Apartment, and Defendant again told Plaintiff that the part had not arrived and that he was still “working on it.”

18. As of the date of this Complaint, approximately three weeks have passed since the Hot Water Failure, and there is still no hot water in Plaintiff’s Apartment.

19. During this entire three‑week period, Plaintiff has had to take cold showers in the Apartment or to forego showering there entirely.

20. Because of the lack of hot water, Plaintiff was forced to obtain a gym membership, costing her approximately $30 per month, for the primary purpose of accessing hot showers and basic hygiene facilities.

21. Plaintiff has also incurred additional expenses in gasoline and transportation to travel to and from the gym for showers.

22. Plaintiff is the parent of a young baby who lives with her in the Apartment.

23. Due to the lack of hot water, Plaintiff has been unable to safely and reasonably bathe her baby in the Apartment and has had to take her baby to her mother’s house for baths, incurring additional inconvenience, travel, and disruption to family life.

24. Boiling water on the stove for dishes and other cleaning has been burdensome, time‑consuming, and poses additional safety risks in an apartment with a baby.

25. Plaintiff has repeatedly and promptly informed Defendant that the lack of hot water continues and that it is severely interfering with her normal use of the Apartment.

26. Defendant has told Plaintiff that he is “working on it” and blamed a backordered part, but has failed to restore hot water within a reasonable time.

27. Defendant has not provided Plaintiff with any meaningful alternative (such as a temporary heater, access to another unit with working hot water, rent reduction, or relocation) during the three‑week period without hot water.

28. Defendant has not reduced Plaintiff’s rent during the time she has been without hot water, despite the Apartment’s substantially diminished value and habitability.

29. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord cannot avoid liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by claiming that a contractor, supplier, or third party has delayed repairs, where the landlord retains control of the premises and has the duty to maintain essential services. See, e.g., Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

30. The continued absence of hot water for a period of approximately three weeks constitutes a serious interference with the health, safety, and comfort of a residential tenant and violates the State Sanitary Code. See 105 CMR 410.190, 410.200, and 410.750; G.L. c. 111, § 127A; see also Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).

31. The State Sanitary Code violations and the prolonged lack of hot water directly interfere with Plaintiff’s right “to quiet enjoyment of [her] premises in [her] tenancy” under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

32. Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home for ordinary, expected purposes—bathing, washing dishes, cleaning, and caring for her baby—has been materially and substantially impaired by the Hot Water Failure.

33. Plaintiff has suffered discomfort, distress, inconvenience, and disruption of normal family life due to the absence of hot water.

34. Plaintiff has suffered out‑of‑pocket economic losses, including at least $30 for a gym membership used primarily to obtain hot showers, as well as gasoline costs and travel expenses, as a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to restore hot water.

35. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has suffered at least $450 in total damages to date, including economic losses, loss of value and use of the Apartment, and consequential harms, and reserves the right to seek additional damages as permitted by law.

36. At all relevant times, Defendant had notice of the Hot Water Failure and an adequate opportunity to remedy it by repair, replacement, or other reasonable measures.

37. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water for approximately three weeks, despite repeated notice, has been at least negligent, and under G.L. c. 186, § 14 constitutes an “act or omission” which interrupts or interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

38. Plaintiff has not unreasonably refused Defendant access for repairs, and nothing Plaintiff has done or failed to do has caused the Hot Water Failure or delayed its repair.

39. Plaintiff brings this action solely for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, § 14.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

40. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–39 above as if fully set forth herein.

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” by any act or omission, and is liable in damages (including multiple damages) for such interference.

42. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law into Plaintiff’s residential tenancy. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

43. A material and substantial failure to maintain essential services and sanitary conditions—such as hot water required by the State Sanitary Code—constitutes an actionable interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:

   a. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s failure to remedy chronic flooding and sewage backups violated covenant of quiet enjoyment);

   b. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where acts or omissions substantially interfere with tenants’ enjoyment even if not intended);

   c. Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (sanitary code violations and related conditions can support quiet enjoyment claims);

   d. Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing importance of maintaining premises in habitable condition);

   e. Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (landlord’s failure to repair conditions after notice may breach quiet enjoyment);

   f. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (substantial code violations and lack of essential services justify tenant relief).

44. Massachusetts law and the State Sanitary Code require that landlords provide tenants with hot water at minimum specified temperatures at all times. See G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 CMR 410.190, 410.200; see also 105 CMR 410.750.

45. Defendant’s failure, for Approximately three weeks, to provide hot water to Plaintiff’s Apartment—an essential service mandated by the State Sanitary Code—constitutes a serious and substantial violation of the sanitary code and materially impairs the character and value of the leased premises. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

46. A landlord’s “omission” that allows serious conditions to persist after notice—including essential service failures—constitutes an interference with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, even where the landlord does not act with bad faith or ill will. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

47. Defendant had actual notice of the lack of hot water at the time of Plaintiff’s initial report and at multiple points thereafter, yet failed to correct the condition within a reasonable time as required by law. See 105 CMR 410.750 (landlord’s duty to correct code violations within specified periods).

48. The duration of the Hot Water Failure—approximately three weeks—far exceeds any reasonable time for restoring an essential service, particularly where no temporary measure, rent abatement, or alternative arrangement was provided.

49. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water or otherwise remedy the problem in a timely manner is an “act or omission” prohibited by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and directly caused an interruption of, and interference with, Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home.

50. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment includes, but is not limited to:

   a. The inability to take normal hot showers or baths in the Apartment;

   b. The inability to safely and reasonably bathe her baby in the Apartment;

   c. The need to use a gym membership primarily to bathe, and the associated costs and inconvenience;

   d. The need to boil water for dishes and cleaning, posing extra labor and safety concerns;

   e. The emotional distress, discomfort, and loss of dignity associated with living without hot water in her home;

   f. The general loss of the use and value of the Apartment as a habitable dwelling.

51. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or at least three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (even where the tenant is self‑represented, the statute authorizes such relief).

52. Plaintiff’s actual damages include, but are not limited to:

   a. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for a gym membership (approximately $30 per month) and related transportation costs incurred for the purpose of basic hygiene;

   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment due to the substantial interference caused by the lack of hot water;

   c. Loss of the fair rental value of the Apartment as compared to a code‑compliant apartment with functioning hot water;

   d. Emotional distress, discomfort, inconvenience, and disruption to daily life and childcare responsibilities.

53. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that, as of the filing of this Complaint, she has suffered at least $450 in damages, and she seeks all damages available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including multiple damages if applicable.

54. The breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment by Defendant was knowing or, at minimum, occurred after Defendant had repeated notice and failed to act with reasonable promptness, thereby justifying enhanced statutory damages. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

55. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment against Defendant for damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to actual and consequential damages, statutory multiple damages (at least three months’ rent or actual damages, whichever is greater), costs, and such further relief as this Court deems just.

56. To the extent necessary, Plaintiff also relies on the statutory and regulatory framework governing minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, including G.L. c. 111, § 127A and 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., as evidence of the uninhabitable and unlawful conditions that give rise to the breach of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977).


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Martinez respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Robert Hargrove, and grant the following relief:

   1. Out‑of‑pocket costs for a gym membership used for showers and related transportation expenses;  

   2. Damages for loss of use and enjoyment and diminished value of the Apartment during the period without hot water;  

   3. Damages for discomfort, inconvenience, and disruption of family life caused by the lack of hot water;

C. Statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount not less than three months’ rent or Plaintiff’s actual damages (including consequential damages), whichever is greater;

D. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

E. Costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs;

F. Reasonable attorney’s fees as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14 (to the extent Plaintiff retains counsel or as otherwise allowed by law);

G. Any further or different relief that this Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.


### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
