CIVIL ACTION NO. ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE (PERSONAL INJURY)  
AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Somerville Grocery Store LLC (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Somerville Grocery Store LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company, organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its principal place of business in Massachusetts and operating a retail grocery store located at 150 Washington Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Store”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, maintained, and/or controlled the Store, including the premises, aisles, and common areas provided for use by customers and invitees.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injuries and related damages resulting from Defendant’s negligence under Massachusetts law.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, placing this matter within the original jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and/or 8, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County and the Store where Plaintiff was injured is located in Middlesex County.

7. At all times material hereto, Defendant conducted business in Middlesex County and purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in this Commonwealth such that the exercise of jurisdiction comports with G.L. c. 223A and with due process.

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

8. On or about August 12, 2023, at approximately midday on a Saturday afternoon, Plaintiff entered the Store at 150 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, as a paying customer to purchase groceries.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on Defendant’s premises. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (abolishing common-law distinction between licensees and invitees and imposing duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

10. Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Store, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, maintenance, and control of its premises, including the aisles and walking surfaces, to keep them in a reasonably safe condition for customers. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).

11. On August 12, 2023, Plaintiff was shopping in the dairy aisle of the Store.

12. While walking normally and exercising due care for her own safety, Plaintiff stepped into a substantial puddle of spilled milk on the floor of the dairy aisle.

13. The puddle of milk was not small or trivial. There were visible grocery cart tracks running through the milk, indicating that multiple customers and/or carts had passed through the spill before Plaintiff’s fall.

14. There were no warning signs, cones, “wet floor” placards, or other visual or verbal warnings in or around the dairy aisle to alert Plaintiff or other customers to the presence of the spilled milk or the dangerous condition it created.

15. As a direct result of stepping onto the milk-covered, slippery surface, Plaintiff’s foot slipped out from under her, causing her to fall forcefully onto her hip on the hard floor.

16. Plaintiff experienced immediate pain in her hip as a result of the fall.

17. At or about the time of Plaintiff’s fall, a Store employee was working in close proximity—approximately fifteen (15) feet away—stocking shelves in the same general area of the dairy aisle.

18. After the fall, the employee approached Plaintiff and, in substance, stated that he had noticed the spilled milk “a few minutes ago,” but was finishing what he was doing before going to get a mop and address the spill.

19. The employee’s statement demonstrates that Defendant, through its agent/employee, had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition (the milk spill) before Plaintiff’s fall, and failed to take timely and reasonable steps to remedy or warn of the hazard.

20. The visible cart tracks through the spilled milk, the size of the puddle, and the employee’s admission that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” before Plaintiff’s fall further indicate that the condition existed for a sufficient length of time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, knew or should have known of the spill and either corrected it or warned customers. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

21. With reasonable safety practices, including adequate inspection, prompt cleanup, and timely placement of warning signs, Defendant could and should have prevented Plaintiff’s fall and injuries.

22. Following the fall, Plaintiff, believing initially that her injury might be minor, completed her grocery shopping and returned home.

23. As the day progressed and into the night, Plaintiff’s hip pain intensified, making it difficult to walk, sit, sleep, and perform normal activities.

24. On or about August 13, 2023, the day after the incident, Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an urgent care facility.

25. At urgent care, Plaintiff was evaluated, including a physical examination, and was diagnosed with a hip sprain.

26. Plaintiff was referred for and subsequently underwent a course of physical therapy to treat the injuries sustained in the fall.

27. As a direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for evaluation and treatment of her hip injury, including urgent care and physical therapy, in an amount presently estimated to be approximately $2,500, and expected to be proven more precisely at trial.

28. As a further direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff was unable to work several scheduled shifts at her café job during her recovery period, and thereby suffered lost wages in an amount presently estimated to be approximately $1,200, and expected to be proven more precisely at trial.

29. Plaintiff experienced and continues to experience pain, discomfort, and limitation of movement in her hip, interfering with her daily life and activities.

30. Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and impairment of her normal activities of daily living as a direct and proximate result of the fall and Defendant’s negligence.

31. Plaintiff has complied, to the extent applicable, with the provisions of Massachusetts law governing the commencement of civil actions for personal injury, including but not limited to G.L. c. 231.

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (PREMISES LIABILITY)

32. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–31 as if fully restated herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land owes a duty to all lawful visitors to act as a reasonable person in maintaining his property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of avoiding the risk. Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973); Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154 (2013).

34. Defendant, as the owner and/or operator of the Store open to the public, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition; to inspect for unsafe conditions; to correct unsafe conditions within a reasonable time; and to warn lawful visitors of any dangers of which it knew or should have known. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 782–83 (2007); Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

35. Defendant further owed a duty to implement and enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the regular inspection, cleanup, and maintenance of floors; for the timely correction of spills; and for the placement of adequate warnings when hazardous conditions existed or were reasonably foreseeable. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 786–88 (discussing reasonable measures to discover and remedy transitory hazards); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 376–77 (2010).

36. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Failing to maintain the floor of the dairy aisle in a reasonably safe condition for customers, including Plaintiff;

   b. Failing to timely inspect, monitor, and supervise the condition of the dairy aisle for spills, slippery substances, and other hazards;

   c. Allowing a substantial puddle of spilled milk to remain on the floor for an unreasonable period of time;

   d. Failing to timely clean, remove, or otherwise remedy the puddle of spilled milk after having actual or constructive notice of that dangerous condition;

   e. Failing to place warning signs, cones, “wet floor” placards, or other warnings in the area of the spill once the dangerous condition was, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been, discovered;

   f. Failing to properly train, supervise, and instruct its employees regarding the prompt detection and remediation of spills and floor hazards and the use of warning devices;

   g. Permitting an employee, who had actual knowledge of the spill, to delay responding to the hazard and instead “finish what he was doing,” thereby allowing the hazard to continue and endanger customers, including Plaintiff;

   h. Failing to adopt and/or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for floor inspection, spill response, and customer safety consistent with the standards of care in the grocery retail industry;

   i. Failing to act as a reasonably prudent person and business owner would under the same or similar circumstances.

37. Defendant’s knowledge of the dangerous condition is established by, among other things, the Store employee’s post-incident admission that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but did not yet take steps to clean it up or warn customers. This constitutes actual notice to Defendant through its employee-agent. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 56 (1983) (duty of reasonable care includes taking reasonable precautions against foreseeable risks).

38. Even if Defendant did not have actual knowledge of the spill, the size of the puddle, its location in a high-traffic dairy aisle, the visible cart tracks through the milk, and the presence of an employee in close proximity demonstrate that the dangerous condition existed long enough that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it. This establishes constructive notice. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 786–87 (discussing constructive notice and methods to infer duration of hazard).

39. The risk that a customer will slip and fall on spilled liquid in a supermarket aisle is foreseeable as a matter of common experience, and Massachusetts law requires reasonable measures to protect against such risks. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 788–89; Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 375–77.

40. Plaintiff did not create the dangerous condition and had no actual knowledge of the spilled milk prior to her fall.

41. The spilled milk was difficult or impossible to discern in time to avoid it under the circumstances, given the absence of any warning signs or cones and the reasonable expectation that Defendant would maintain safe walking surfaces.

42. Plaintiff at all relevant times acted as a reasonably prudent person for her own safety and was exercising due care while shopping in the Store.

43. To the extent Defendant may assert comparative negligence or other defenses, Plaintiff denies any negligence on her part. In any event, Plaintiff’s conduct, if deemed negligent in any respect, was not greater than the negligence of Defendant, and any damages shall be diminished only in proportion to any negligence attributed to Plaintiff pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85. See Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 63–64 (1988).

44. Defendant’s breaches of duty were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. “Proximate cause” under Massachusetts law requires that the negligence be a substantial contributing factor in producing the harm. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury to her hip, including but not limited to a hip sprain, pain, and functional limitations.

46. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses related to emergency/urgent evaluation, diagnostic procedures, treatment, and physical therapy in an amount presently estimated at approximately $2,500, subject to proof at trial. See G.L. c. 233, § 79G (admissibility of medical and hospital records and bills).

47. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including missing several shifts from her café employment, in an amount presently estimated at approximately $1,200, subject to proof at trial.

48. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience conscious pain and suffering, physical discomfort, and emotional distress as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall. See G.L. c. 231, § 60F (recognizing damages for pain and suffering in personal injury actions).

49. Plaintiff has suffered impairment of and interference with her ability to participate in and enjoy the normal activities of daily living, including work, household tasks, recreation, and other aspects of life.

50. Plaintiff has suffered and will in the future suffer loss of enjoyment of life arising from the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence. See Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 871–72 (1991) (recognizing damages for loss of enjoyment of life as part of pain and suffering).

51. Plaintiff has incurred and may continue to incur additional out-of-pocket expenses relating to her injuries, including transportation for medical treatment, over-the-counter and prescription medications, and other incidental costs associated with her care and recovery.

52. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to reasonable medical expenses, lost wages and earning capacity, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and other consequential damages. See G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions).

53. Defendant is vicariously liable, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and/or servants, including but not limited to the employee who observed the spill and failed to take prompt corrective action, because such acts and omissions occurred within the course and scope of their employment and in furtherance of Defendant’s business. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–20 (2002).

54. Defendant is also directly liable for its own negligence in failing to adopt, implement, and enforce reasonable policies and procedures for inspection, maintenance, spill response, and customer safety on its premises.

55. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions.

56. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–55 as if fully restated herein.

   b. Past medical expenses in an amount presently estimated to be approximately $2,500, with additional medical expenses reasonably anticipated in the future if further treatment is required;
