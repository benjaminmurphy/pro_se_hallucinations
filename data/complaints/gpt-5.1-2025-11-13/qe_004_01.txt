    Defendant.  
--------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Maria Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this action against Defendant John Carter (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) and states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maria Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant John Carter is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

3. At all times relevant, Defendant has been the landlord of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action arising out of a residential landlord–tenant relationship, including claims concerning quiet enjoyment and conditions of residential rental property.

5. Venue is proper in the Worcester Division of the District Court Department / Central Division of the Housing Court because the Premises are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and all relevant events occurred within this division. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1–2; G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3–4.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603.

7. Plaintiff’s tenancy is residential and at all relevant times has been for the use and occupancy of Plaintiff as her home.

8. Plaintiff has paid (and continues to pay) monthly rent in the amount of $1,200 to Defendant.

9. At all times relevant, Plaintiff has complied with her obligations as a tenant, including timely payment of rent and reasonable care of the Premises.

10. Massachusetts law imposes an implied warranty of habitability and an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in every residential tenancy. See Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 239, § 8A.

11. In or around early September 2025, approximately three months before the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen in the Premises.

12. Plaintiff found droppings on kitchen counters, inside kitchen cabinets, and in areas where she stores food.

13. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mouse problem after first discovering the droppings, doing so within a reasonable time and in a manner reasonably calculated to inform Defendant, as required by Massachusetts law for notice of conditions. See, e.g., Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–48 (2005).

14. After Plaintiff’s initial complaint, Defendant placed a few mouse traps in or near the kitchen area.

15. The traps caught only a small number of mice (approximately two), and the presence of mouse droppings continued on a regular basis.

16. Plaintiff continued to find fresh mouse droppings in her kitchen over a period of months, including weekly occurrences during September, October, and November 2025.

17. Defendant told Plaintiff that mice were “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff needed to keep her kitchen cleaner, despite the fact that Plaintiff keeps her kitchen clean and sanitary.

18. Plaintiff maintains a high level of cleanliness in the kitchen, including promptly cleaning surfaces, properly storing food, and taking out trash regularly.

19. Plaintiff reasonably believes, and was told by an exterminator, that the mouse infestation is not due to Plaintiff’s housekeeping but to the building’s condition, including possible entry points, gaps, or structural defects permitting rodents to enter.

20. At one point during this period, Defendant hired an exterminator for a single visit to the building.

21. The exterminator treated the property once and informed Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive and ongoing pest-control measures to effectively address the infestation.

22. Plaintiff relayed or attempted to relay these concerns and recommendations to Defendant.

23. Defendant declined to authorize additional or more comprehensive extermination services, stating that such treatment would be “overkill” and “too expensive.”

24. Despite Defendant’s minimal steps, the mouse problem persisted, and Plaintiff continued to discover mouse droppings regularly in the kitchen.

25. The presence of rodents and rodent droppings in the Premises constitutes a material violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.550 (pest control) and 105 C.M.R. 410.602 (conditions deemed to endanger or impair health or safety).

26. Under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and the State Sanitary Code, landlords are responsible for maintaining dwellings in compliance with minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, including the duty to exterminate rodents and other pests and to maintain the structure in rodent-free condition.

27. The presence of rodent droppings in areas where food is prepared and stored poses health and safety risks, including risk of contamination and disease.

28. Because of the ongoing mouse infestation, Plaintiff has been forced to discard food items that were potentially contaminated or that could no longer be safely consumed.

29. Over the last several months, Plaintiff has had to throw away food stored in boxes or bags that were not fully sealed or that could have come into contact with rodent droppings, with an approximate value of $200.

30. To protect her remaining food and to attempt to mitigate the problem, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers and other protective storage items for approximately $80.

31. Thus, as a direct result of Defendant’s failure to adequately address the rodent infestation, Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses totaling approximately $280.

32. In addition to monetary losses, Plaintiff has experienced significant anxiety, discomfort, and distress in her home due to the presence of rodents and their droppings.

33. Plaintiff feels unsafe and uneasy cooking, eating, or preparing food in her own kitchen.

34. Plaintiff’s enjoyment and use of the Premises have been substantially and unreasonably interfered with by the persistent rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to provide effective remedial measures.

35. Defendant’s response to the infestation has been inadequate and indifferent, consisting of only a few traps and a single exterminator visit, and a refusal to engage in more comprehensive pest-control measures despite clear ongoing problems.

36. Defendant has implied that the ongoing condition is Plaintiff’s fault by accusing her of not keeping the kitchen clean, despite the exterminator’s assessment and Plaintiff’s own cleaning efforts.

37. Defendant’s conduct in failing to eliminate the infestation, in minimizing the severity of the problem, and in blaming Plaintiff for the condition has been intentional or, at a minimum, in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and well-being.

38. The continuing presence of rodents and rodent droppings constitutes a “serious interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, and Massachusetts case law, including Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 717–19 (1977) (landlord liable where actions or omissions cause substantial interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment) and Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 283–84 (1994).

39. Defendant’s failure to correct the rodent infestation, despite notice of the problem and the continuing nature of the condition, constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law.

40. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a result of Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to: (a) approximately $280 in out-of-pocket expenses, (b) loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Premises, particularly the kitchen, (c) emotional distress and anxiety related to living with pests in her home, and (d) diminution in the value of the rental premises during the period of infestation.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

41. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. Under Massachusetts law, every residential rental agreement includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14, which protects tenants against serious interference with their tenancy caused by the landlord or those acting under his authority.

43. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or, alternatively, for minimum statutory damages of three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

44. To establish a claim under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant must show a serious interference with her quiet enjoyment caused by the landlord or by someone acting for the landlord. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982).

45. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when conditions substantially impair the character and value of the leased premises and the landlord fails to take reasonable steps to remedy them after notice. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708, 720–21 (2002).

46. A recurring infestation of rodents in a dwelling unit, particularly in food preparation areas, constitutes a significant interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises and violates state sanitary and housing codes. See 105 C.M.R. 410.550, 410.602; see also Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–203 (1973).

47. Landlords have a non-delegable duty to maintain residential premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and to make necessary repairs and take steps to abate conditions that endanger or materially impair the health, safety, or well-being of tenants. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 200–01; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–02 (1979).

48. A landlord’s failure to correct serious code violations after notice can constitute an “indirect interference” with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 283–84 (1994); Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–49 (2005).

49. Here, Plaintiff gave Defendant timely notice of the rodent infestation and continuing mouse droppings in the kitchen.

50. Despite having notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to eradicate the infestation and to maintain the Premises in sanitary and habitable condition, instead doing only minimal measures (a few traps and one exterminator visit) and refusing further comprehensive treatment.

51. Defendant’s refusal to follow the exterminator’s recommendation for more comprehensive treatment and his decision to prioritize cost savings over Plaintiff’s health, safety, and quiet enjoyment constitute intentional or reckless conduct within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982) (landlord’s deliberate failure to remedy serious water and sewage conditions supported quiet enjoyment violation); Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

52. Defendant’s statements that the infestation was “normal for older buildings” and that Plaintiff should simply be “cleaner,” combined with his refusal to authorize adequate pest control, demonstrate that Defendant knowingly and consciously chose not to correct the condition despite understanding its impact on Plaintiff’s occupancy.

53. Defendant’s conduct has caused a substantial and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, particularly the kitchen, which is essential to normal residential life.

54. The presence of rodent droppings in the kitchen and food storage areas has effectively deprived Plaintiff of the full and safe use of that portion of the Premises, resulting in a partial constructive eviction of that area. See Westland Housing Corp. v. Scott, 312 Mass. 375, 381–82 (1942) (constructive eviction arises where landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with tenant’s beneficial enjoyment of the premises).

55. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:
    a. Property loss in the form of food discarded due to rodent contamination (approximately $200);  
    b. Costs for plastic containers and related protective items (approximately $80);  
    c. Loss of use and enjoyment of the kitchen and diminution in the value of the Premises during the period of infestation; and  
    d. Emotional distress, anxiety, and discomfort associated with living with rodents and their droppings.

56. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or, at her election, statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (if any attorney is later retained).

57. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200; three months’ rent is $3,600. Three months’ rent substantially exceeds the approximately $280 in out-of-pocket damages identified above.

58. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover statutory damages in the amount of at least $3,600, along with costs and, if applicable, reasonable attorney’s fees, for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant John Carter and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, by failing to abate the rodent infestation and maintain the Premises in habitable and sanitary condition;

C. An order awarding Plaintiff her costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs under applicable law;

D. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, in the event Plaintiff later retains counsel, or such other relief related to legal assistance as the Court deems appropriate;

E. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to appropriate orders to ensure that the Premises are brought into compliance with the State Sanitary Code and maintained free from rodent infestation.
