**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Plaintiff,

v.

**RYAN SMITH,**  
Defendant.  

____________________________________/

### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE


Plaintiff Mark Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Ryan Smith (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Mark Johnson is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Ryan Smith is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was operating a motor vehicle in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising out of a bicycle–motor vehicle “dooring” collision that occurred in Boston, Massachusetts on September 12, 2023.

4. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 when considering Plaintiff’s past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering and other non‑economic damages.

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and 9 because the cause of action arose in Suffolk County and Defendant was operating a motor vehicle at 55 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, at the time of the incident.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about September 12, 2023, at approximately 8:00 a.m. (or such other time as discovery may show), Plaintiff was riding his bicycle to work in Boston, Massachusetts.

7. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was traveling eastbound on Commonwealth Avenue, in Boston, in a clearly marked bicycle lane adjacent to the roadway and a curbside loading zone near 55 Commonwealth Avenue.

8. Plaintiff was operating his bicycle in a careful, prudent, and lawful manner, complying with applicable traffic signs, signals, and markings, and in accordance with Massachusetts bicycle and traffic laws, including but not limited to G.L. c. 85, § 11B, G.L. c. 89, and G.L. c. 90.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was wearing an appropriate bicycle helmet and exercising due care for his own safety.

10. At or about the same time and place, Defendant was operating, controlling, and/or in charge of a motor vehicle used as a rideshare vehicle that was stopped or parked in a curbside loading zone immediately adjacent to the bicycle lane at or near 55 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

11. Defendant’s vehicle was positioned such that the driver’s side door, when opened, would extend into and directly across the marked bicycle lane in which Plaintiff was lawfully traveling.

12. Without first checking his side mirrors, rear‑view mirror, looking over his shoulder, or otherwise ascertaining that it was safe to open his door, Defendant suddenly and abruptly swung open the driver’s side door directly into the path of Plaintiff’s oncoming bicycle.

13. Defendant opened his door into the bike lane at or near the exact moment Plaintiff was lawfully passing alongside Defendant’s vehicle, leaving Plaintiff no reasonable time or distance in which to brake, avoid, or safely maneuver around the opened door.

14. Plaintiff was confronted with a sudden, unexpected, and unavoidable obstacle when Defendant’s door entered and blocked the bicycle lane.

15. As a direct and immediate result of Defendant’s abrupt opening of his vehicle door into the path of Plaintiff’s bicycle, Plaintiff collided with the edge of the open door.

16. The impact caused Plaintiff to be thrown forward and off his bicycle, crashing onto the pavement of the roadway.

17. Plaintiff sustained abrasions and “road rash” on his arms and legs, as well as a chipped front tooth as a direct and proximate result of the impact with Defendant’s door and the pavement.

18. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and damaged in the collision and was rendered unsafe and not reasonably repairable for regular use.

19. At the scene of the collision, Defendant admitted to Plaintiff, in substance and effect, that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he had been looking at or “checking” his phone, and that he opened his door without properly looking for bicyclists.

20. Defendant’s admission that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was distracted by his phone constitutes an admission of fault and is evidence that Defendant failed to keep a proper lookout before opening his vehicle door.

21. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a reasonably foreseeable user of the roadway and bicycle lane adjacent to Defendant’s vehicle, a duty to exercise reasonable care, to comply with Massachusetts traffic and bicycle safety laws, and specifically to ensure that the door of his motor vehicle could be opened safely without endangering passing bicyclists and other traffic.

22. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:

   a. Failing to check his mirror, blind spot, or otherwise look for approaching bicyclists before opening his door;

   b. Opening his vehicle door into a marked bicycle lane when it was not safe to do so;

   c. Opening his vehicle door when it was foreseeable that bicyclists would be traveling in the lane adjacent to his vehicle;

   d. Failing to keep a proper lookout for bicyclists and other lawful users of the roadway;

   e. Becoming distracted by his cell phone immediately prior to opening his door;

   f. Failing to comply with applicable Massachusetts statutes and regulations governing the opening of vehicle doors and the sharing of the road with bicyclists; and

   g. Failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

23. After the collision, Plaintiff promptly sought necessary medical and dental treatment, including but not limited to evaluation and treatment for his abrasions and dental work to repair his chipped front tooth.

24. Plaintiff reasonably incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,500 for treatment relating to the injuries he suffered in the collision, including but not limited to emergency care, follow‑up medical visits, and dental procedures.

25. Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time following the collision and thereby lost wages in the approximate amount of $500.

26. Plaintiff’s bicycle, which had a sound frame prior to the collision, suffered a bent and damaged frame as a result of the impact, requiring Plaintiff to replace the bicycle at his own expense.

27. In addition to his out‑of‑pocket economic losses, Plaintiff experienced and continues to experience physical pain, discomfort, limitations in his activities of daily living, and emotional distress and anxiety related to riding a bicycle in traffic following the collision.

28. Plaintiff timely presented a claim to Defendant’s motor vehicle insurer, reporting that Defendant had opened his door into the bike lane and caused the collision while Plaintiff was riding lawfully and steadily in the marked lane.

29. Plaintiff cooperated with the insurer’s investigation; however, the insurer subsequently informed Plaintiff that Defendant had claimed that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

30. Plaintiff was not weaving in and out of traffic; he was riding steadily and lawfully within the marked bicycle lane on Commonwealth Avenue at the time of the collision.

31. Any assertions by Defendant that Plaintiff was weaving in and out of traffic are false and appear to have been made in an effort to avoid responsibility for Defendant’s own negligent conduct.

32. Plaintiff’s own conduct did not cause or contribute to the collision, and Plaintiff at all times exercised reasonable care and complied with applicable laws.

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injuries, dental injuries, property damage, lost wages, medical expenses, pain and suffering, mental anguish, and impairment in his enjoyment of life, all to his damage in an amount to be determined at trial.

### IV. APPLICABLE MASSACHUSETTS LAW

34. Under Massachusetts law, all motorists owe a duty of reasonable care to other users of the roadway, including bicyclists lawfully traveling in bike lanes and on public ways. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (general duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors); *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 731–32 (2000).

35. The elements of a negligence claim in Massachusetts are: (1) the existence of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the breach and the plaintiff’s injury; and (4) actual damages. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

36. A violation of a safety statute designed to protect a particular class of persons, such as bicyclists and other lawful road users, may be evidence of negligence. *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990); *Lindsey v. Massios*, 372 Mass. 79, 83 (1977).

37. G.L. c. 90, § 14 provides that motorists shall “slow down and pass bicycles only when it is safe to do so” and requires due care to avoid colliding with bicyclists; it further provides that motor vehicle operators and passengers shall “not open a door unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists,” and shall not leave a door open on the side available to moving traffic for a period of time longer than necessary to load or unload passengers.

38. G.L. c. 85, § 11B and related provisions recognize bicyclists as lawful and legitimate users of public ways and require that they be afforded the same rights and subject to the same duties as drivers of motor vehicles, except as otherwise specifically provided.

39. Massachusetts appellate courts have long recognized that an operator of a motor vehicle has a duty to exercise reasonable care in opening doors of a parked vehicle so as not to endanger passing traffic. See, e.g., *Koonce v. Aldo Realty Trust*, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 1001 (1979) (Rule 1:28 decision, noting duty to avoid creating sudden obstruction in path of plaintiff); see generally *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 60–61 (1983) (defining scope of duty by foreseeability).

40. Negligence may be established by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences, and a plaintiff is not required to exclude every possible cause other than the defendant’s negligence. *Zeigler v. Rater*, 318 Mass. 76, 79 (1945); *Carey v. New Yorker of Worcester, Inc.*, 355 Mass. 450, 453 (1969).

41. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, comparative negligence, any negligence on the part of Plaintiff—if found to exist and to be less than 51% of the total negligence—would merely reduce, but not bar, his recovery; Plaintiff denies any comparative fault but pleads in the alternative that his negligence, if any, was less than that of Defendant.

42. A tortfeasor in Massachusetts “takes the plaintiff as he finds him,” and is responsible for all damages proximately caused by his negligence, even if the plaintiff is particularly susceptible to injury. *Wallace v. Ludwig*, 292 Mass. 251, 255 (1935); *O’Connor v. Raymark Indus., Inc.*, 401 Mass. 586, 590 (1988).

43. Pain and suffering and other non‑economic damages are recoverable in negligence actions under Massachusetts common law. *Morrissey v. New England Deaconess Ass’n–Abundant Life Communities, Inc.*, 458 Mass. 580, 589 (2011); *Furtado v. Furtado*, 380 Mass. 137, 142 (1980).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

44. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 43 as if fully set forth herein.

45. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation and control of his motor vehicle and in opening and maintaining his vehicle doors, so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others, including bicyclists lawfully using the adjacent bicycle lane.

46. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty under G.L. c. 90, § 14, G.L. c. 85, § 11B, and related Massachusetts traffic safety statutes and regulations, to refrain from opening a vehicle door into the path of moving traffic, including a marked bicycle lane, unless and until it was reasonably safe to do so.

47. Defendant breached his duties of care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to keep a proper lookout for bicyclists and other traffic before opening his driver’s side door;

   b. Opening his vehicle door into a marked bicycle lane when a bicyclist (Plaintiff) was approaching and it was not reasonably safe to do so;

   c. Failing to check mirrors and blind spots prior to opening the door;

   d. Being distracted by his cell phone immediately prior to opening his door;

   e. Failing to appreciate the foreseeable risk to bicyclists traveling in the bicycle lane adjacent to the loading zone;

   f. Failing to comply with G.L. c. 90, § 14’s prohibition on opening doors when it is not reasonably safe and where it interferes with the movement of traffic, including bicyclists; and

   g. Otherwise failing to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like or similar circumstances.

48. Defendant’s actions and omissions described herein constituted negligence under Massachusetts common law. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146–47; *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. at 696.

49. Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14 and related regulations designed to protect the safety of bicyclists and users of the public way is evidence of negligence and further supports Plaintiff’s claim. *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. at 358; *Lindsey v. Massios*, 372 Mass. at 83.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff collided with the open door of Defendant’s vehicle, was thrown to the pavement, and sustained the following injuries and damages:

   a. Physical injuries including abrasions and road rash to his arms and legs;

   b. Dental injury, specifically a chipped front tooth requiring dental repair;

   c. Property damage, including a bent and damaged bicycle frame necessitating replacement or substantial repair;

   d. Past medical and dental expenses of approximately $1,500, and such additional expenses as may be proven at trial;

   e. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $500 resulting from time missed from work due to his injuries, as well as any further loss of earning capacity that may be established at trial;

   f. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, discomfort, and limitations on activities of daily living;

   g. Emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life, particularly related to riding a bicycle in traffic; and

   h. Such additional special and general damages as evidence may show.

51. Plaintiff has suffered, and may continue to suffer, physical and emotional harms, as well as economic losses, and is entitled to full compensation for these damages under Massachusetts law. *Morrissey*, 458 Mass. at 589; *Furtado*, 380 Mass. at 142.

52. Any negligence alleged by Defendant or others to have been committed by Plaintiff is expressly denied. In the alternative, and without admitting any comparative negligence, Plaintiff pleads that any negligence attributed to him was less than that of Defendant and therefore does not bar recovery under G.L. c. 231, § 85.
