The court discusses standards of proof, parental fitness, and children\u2019s need for a safe, stable environment, but it does not address or weigh a parent\u2019s willingness or ability to foster the child\u2019s relationship with the other parent as a custody factor. Thus, it does not provide authority for the specific proposition cited.",

The court\u2019s best\u2011interests analysis focuses on developmental needs, stability, attachments, and relative/foster placements, not on promoting a child\u2019s relationship with an opposing parent. Thus, it does not establish the principle that fostering the child\u2019s relationship with the other parent is a critical custody factor.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Once the judge concluded that parental unfitness was established, he correctly determined that the central question was whether it was in Hugo\u2019s best interests to remain with his foster mother or to be transferred to the care and custody of his aunt. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (c). The \u201cbest interests of a child\u201d is a question that presents the trial judge \u201cwith a classic example of a discretionary decision.\u201d ... Here, the judge had to weigh the benefits of stability, of keeping Hugo in his present home, with moving him to a family where, in his judgment, it is more likely that Hugo will receive the home support, stability, and reinforcement of efforts to address his developmental needs so critical to his future development."
