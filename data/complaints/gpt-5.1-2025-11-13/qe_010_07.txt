COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  



I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, where she rents and occupies a residential apartment.

2. Defendant Sarah Bennett (“Defendant”) is an individual and the owner and/or manager of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Premises”), which she rents to Plaintiff.

3. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the tenancy of an apartment at the Premises, located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Lowell District Court.

4. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

5. This action is brought for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, specifically G.L. c. 186, § 14.

6. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 223, § 8, because the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the causes of action arose within this judicial district.



II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises since on or about May 1, 2022, and is a lawful tenant of Defendant.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord, owner, and/or person in control of the Premises, including Plaintiff’s apartment and the bathroom therein.

9. Plaintiff’s bathroom at the Premises has no window and relies solely on a mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation.

10. In 2025, visible mold growth began to appear in the bathroom, initially in the corner of the shower area.

11. Over time, the mold spread from the corner of the shower to the ceiling and other bathroom surfaces, becoming extensive and obvious.

12. Plaintiff regularly uses the bathroom exhaust fan during showers, although not necessarily every single time, and takes ordinary hot showers typical for a residential tenant.

13. After the mold appeared, Plaintiff began experiencing respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which she had not experienced prior to the mold growth in the bathroom.

14. Plaintiff consulted a medical doctor, who opined that Plaintiff’s respiratory symptoms were likely related to or exacerbated by the mold in her bathroom and advised that the mold condition should be remediated.

15. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the mold condition. Defendant came to inspect the bathroom and observed the mold.

16. Rather than acknowledging her responsibility as landlord to maintain the Premises in a habitable and safe condition, Defendant blamed Plaintiff, claiming Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and took showers that were “too hot and too long.”

17. Defendant has stated she will only “clean” the existing mold growth but will not take steps to properly remediate the mold condition or address the underlying cause, including the inadequate ventilation in a bathroom with no window and only a fan that has proven insufficient.

18. Defendant has refused to take reasonable steps to correct the conditions, including but not limited to: (a) arranging for professional mold remediation; (b) ensuring the bathroom ventilation is adequate; and/or (c) repairing or upgrading the exhaust fan or other systems so as to prevent recurrence.

19. Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property that became moldy and unusable, including a shower curtain and towels, with an approximate replacement cost of $60.

20. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure to adequately remedy it have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, particularly her ability to safely use the bathroom for bathing and other ordinary purposes.

21. Plaintiff has experienced fear and anxiety about her health, discomfort using the bathroom, and actual physical respiratory symptoms that her doctor has linked to the mold condition.

22. The persistent mold, inadequate ventilation, and Defendant’s refusal to properly remediate constitute an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her tenancy.

23. Plaintiff estimates her damages, exclusive of any statutory multipliers, at approximately $150, including rent-based damages for loss of use and enjoyment of the premises and property losses, and seeks all relief available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including mandatory minimum damages and multiple damages as provided by law.



III. LEGAL BACKGROUND

24. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

25. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

26. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when the landlord, by act or omission, causes a serious interference with the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 283–84 (1994).

27. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in compliance with the state Sanitary Code and health and safety requirements can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–77 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

28. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., imposes duties on landlords to maintain residential dwellings in a condition that does not endanger or materially impair the health or safety of the occupants, including requirements that bathrooms be adequately ventilated and kept free from chronic dampness and mold that may affect health. See 105 C.M.R. 410.100 (ventilation), 410.750–410.830 (owner responsibilities).

29. In Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973), the Supreme Judicial Court held that substantial code violations affecting health and safety can constitute a breach of obligations owed to the tenant and justify rent abatement and other remedies.

30. A landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for conditions that the landlord knows about and fails to remedy with reasonable diligence, where those conditions substantially interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. See Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 748–50 (2005); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

31. Massachusetts courts recognize that ongoing unhealthy or unsafe conditions, including environmental or sanitary problems such as water infiltration, dampness, or mold-like conditions, which a landlord fails to reasonably address, may amount to a serious interference with quiet enjoyment. See Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 776–77; Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Doe, 417 Mass. at 283–84.

32. A tenant prevailing on a claim under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is entitled to “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. See Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 399–401 (1982).

33. Defendant, by failing to properly remediate the mold condition and to provide adequate ventilation and a safe, sanitary bathroom, has violated her obligations under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related common-law duties to ensure that Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is not seriously interfered with.



IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

34. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–33 as if fully set forth herein.

35. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in connection with Plaintiff’s tenancy at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law.

36. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the substantial mold growth in Plaintiff’s bathroom and the lack of adequate ventilation in a windowless bathroom dependent solely on a mechanical exhaust fan.

37. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the mold condition and its impact on her health and use of the premises, giving Defendant opportunity to correct the problem.

38. Despite having notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to properly remediate the mold, to investigate the cause of the excessive moisture, or to repair or upgrade the ventilation or other building systems needed to prevent recurring mold in a bathroom without a window.

39. Defendant instead blamed Plaintiff for the condition, refused to address underlying ventilation or moisture issues, and offered only inadequate, temporary “cleaning” of visible mold.

40. Defendant’s acts and omissions allowed the mold condition and related unhealthy bathroom environment to continue for a significant period, interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to safely use the bathroom and to comfortably reside in the Premises.

41. The mold condition and inadequately ventilated bathroom materially impaired Plaintiff’s health and safety, as evidenced by Plaintiff’s respiratory symptoms and her doctor’s opinion that the symptoms are likely related to the mold.

42. Defendant’s failure to correct the mold and ventilation issues, after notice, constitutes a serious interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment and thus a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and cases such as Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994), and Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Premises; (b) discomfort, distress, and inconvenience; (c) respiratory symptoms and health-related impacts; and (d) property loss of at least $60 for a shower curtain and towels rendered unusable by mold.

44. Plaintiff estimates her actual damages at approximately $150; however, under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover not less than three months’ rent or her actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, even if she appears pro se. See Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 399–401 (1982).

45. Defendant’s conduct was willful, intentional, or at least in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, insofar as Defendant knew of the condition, refused to take adequate remedial measures, and attempted to shift blame to Plaintiff rather than comply with her statutory and common-law duties.



V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Sarah Bennett and award the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount to be determined by the Court, including at least three months’ rent (3 × $1,200 = $3,600) or Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, together with statutory multiple damages as applicable.

C. Compensation for Plaintiff’s actual damages, including but not limited to:  
   1. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises;  
   2. Property damage for personal items destroyed by mold (approximately $60); and  
   3. Non-economic harms such as discomfort, distress, and inconvenience associated with the unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.

D. Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14; and to the extent Plaintiff proceeds pro se, any allowed costs and fees to which she may be legally entitled.

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.



VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.



Respectfully submitted,
