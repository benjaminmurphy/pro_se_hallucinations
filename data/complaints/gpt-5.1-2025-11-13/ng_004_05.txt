    Plaintiff,  

v.  

SARAH THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  


COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)


Plaintiff Emily Martinez (“Plaintiff”), acting pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Sarah Thompson (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Martinez is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff was lawfully present at the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

2. Defendant Sarah Thompson is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or person in control of the three‑unit residential apartment building and abutting sidewalk located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, possessed, and/or controlled the Premises and assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the sidewalk abutting the Premises, including snow and ice removal.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for negligence arising out of a slip‑and‑fall incident that occurred on February 15, 2023, at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $7,000, inclusive of medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, but is within the jurisdictional limits of the Worcester District Court. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A, 19C.

6. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, § 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Defendant owns and/or controls a three‑unit residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603.

8. The Premises include an abutting sidewalk that tenants, guests, invitees, delivery persons, and members of the public use for ingress and egress to the building.

9. On or about February 13–15, 2023, a snowstorm occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts, depositing snow and creating winter conditions on and around the Premises.

10. Following the snowstorm and prior to February 15, 2023, Defendant or her agents undertook snow removal on the sidewalk by shoveling a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk.

11. Defendant did not apply salt, sand, ice melt, or any other reasonable traction or melting material to the shoveled path after the storm.

12. Over the next couple of days, temperatures fluctuated above and below freezing, causing snow and ice to melt during the day and refreeze at night, creating a dangerous sheet of ice on the narrow shoveled path.

13. As a result of this melt‑and‑refreeze cycle and Defendant’s failure to treat the path with sand, salt, or similar measures, a slippery, transparent, and dangerous sheet of ice formed on the walkway, rendering it unreasonably hazardous to pedestrians.

14. Tenants of the Premises, observing the icy condition, texted Defendant to complain about the dangerous ice on the sidewalk and to request that she take further steps to make the area safe.

15. The tenants also sent photographs of the ice condition to Defendant by text message.

16. In response, Defendant told the tenants, in substance, that “the sun will take care of it,” thereby expressly declining to take corrective measures such as sanding, salting, or otherwise treating the hazardous condition.

17. Defendant therefore had actual notice of the dangerous icy condition on the sidewalk for at least some time before February 15, 2023, and consciously chose not to remedy it.

18. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was working as a grocery delivery person and routinely delivered groceries to tenants at various addresses in Worcester, including the Premises.

19. On February 15, 2023, at approximately __________ (time unknown), Plaintiff arrived at 123 Maple Street to deliver groceries to a lawful tenant of the building.

20. Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as an invitee and/or lawful visitor, performing a delivery for the benefit of a tenant and in connection with the ordinary use of the property.

21. Plaintiff approached the building by walking on the sidewalk along the narrow shoveled path left by Defendant.

22. The icy condition on the path was not open and obvious to Plaintiff, or, to the extent it was visible at all, it appeared to be a normal, passable walkway that other persons used, and Plaintiff acted reasonably in walking there. See Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 340–41 (2010).

23. As Plaintiff proceeded up the sidewalk in a normal manner, her feet suddenly slipped out from under her on the sheet of ice, causing her to fall backward forcefully onto the hard sidewalk surface.

24. Plaintiff landed on her lower back, experiencing immediate and severe pain.

25. As a direct result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained a lower back injury requiring medical evaluation and treatment.

26. After the incident, tenants of the building informed Plaintiff that they had previously warned Defendant about the icy condition, had texted her about it, and had sent her pictures of the sidewalk covered in ice.

27. The tenants further told Plaintiff that Defendant responded to their concerns by saying that “the sun will take care of it,” rather than taking any steps to remedy the condition.

28. Defendant failed to close off, cone, rope, or otherwise warn of the icy area, and failed to provide an alternative safe path for lawful visitors.

29. Defendant failed to place any warning signs, cones, barriers, or other precautions on or near the icy sidewalk to alert pedestrians such as Plaintiff to the danger.

30. At all times, Plaintiff was exercising due care for her own safety while walking on the sidewalk.

31. Plaintiff’s fall and injuries were not caused by any negligence or fault of Plaintiff, but solely and proximately by Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition, and in failing to take reasonable measures to address the known accumulation of ice.

32. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought medical treatment for her lower back injury, including but not limited to evaluation by medical providers, diagnostic testing, and follow‑up care.

33. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $3,500 in medical expenses related to treatment of her injuries.

34. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week and lost approximately $800 in wages.

35. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in her daily activities due to the lower back injury.

36. Plaintiff has also suffered emotional distress, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life as a consequence of the fall and the resulting injury.

37. Plaintiff expects to incur additional pain, suffering, and possible medical expenses in the future as a result of the injuries sustained in the fall.

### IV. DUTY, BREACH, CAUSATION, AND DAMAGES (NEGLIGENCE)

38. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–37 as though fully set forth herein.

39. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of premises has a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property, including walkways and sidewalks under its control, in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973).

40. This duty of reasonable care includes taking reasonable steps to prevent or remedy the accumulation of snow and ice on walkways that are intended for use by tenants, guests, and invitees after a reasonable period of time following a storm, and after the owner undertakes snow removal. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 383–84 (2010).

41. In Papadopoulos, the Supreme Judicial Court abolished the distinction between “natural” and “unnatural” accumulations of snow and ice and held that property owners owe lawful visitors a duty to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances in the maintenance of property with respect to snow and ice. Id. at 383.

42. Defendant, as owner and/or person in control of the Premises and abutting sidewalk, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition, including with respect to accumulations of snow and ice. See Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 383–84; G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence framework for tort actions).

43. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to take reasonable steps to guard against foreseeable risks of harm from dangerous conditions on the Premises of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known. See Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995).

44. Defendant undertook partial snow removal by shoveling a narrow path, thereby creating an apparent walkway for use by tenants and invitees such as Plaintiff.

45. Having created and held out this narrow shoveled path as the main means of pedestrian access, Defendant had a duty to perform snow and ice removal with reasonable care, including the use of salt, sand, or other treatment where reasonably necessary to prevent hazardous ice buildup. See Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 383–84; cf. Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013) (landowner liable where failure to maintain area of ingress/egress created foreseeable risk of harm).

46. Defendant also had a duty to act with reasonable care once she received notice, through tenant complaints and photographs, that the shoveled path had become a sheet of ice and was unreasonably dangerous.

47. Defendant breached her duty of reasonable care in numerous ways, including but not limited to:

   a. Failing to apply salt, sand, ice melt, or other appropriate materials to the walkway after shoveling the snow;

   b. Failing to inspect the walkway and sidewalk during the days following the storm, despite foreseeable melt‑and‑refreeze conditions;

   c. Failing to respond appropriately to tenant complaints and photographs showing the dangerous icy condition;

   d. Ignoring tenant warnings and instead relying on the “sun” to remedy a known hazardous condition;

   e. Failing to remove or treat ice after a reasonable time had passed following the snowstorm;

   f. Failing to block off or reroute pedestrians away from the icy area;

   g. Failing to place signs, cones, or other warnings to alert lawful visitors, including Plaintiff, to the hazardous condition; and

   h. Generally failing to maintain the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition, as a reasonably prudent property owner would under similar circumstances.

48. A reasonably prudent property owner in the same or similar circumstances would have:

   a. Recognized the risk of melt‑and‑refreeze creating ice on the shoveled path;

   b. Taken tenant complaints and photographs seriously and promptly acted to treat, salt, or sand the area;

   c. Conducted reasonable inspections after the storm and during freeze/thaw cycles; and

   d. Taken reasonable precautions to prevent visitors from encountering a known sheet of ice.

49. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of reasonable care required under Massachusetts law and therefore constitutes negligence. See Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (negligence based on failure to maintain premises in safe condition); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 54–55 (1983) (duty defined by reasonable foreseeability of harm).

50. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip‑and‑fall on February 15, 2023, and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (causation where negligence is substantial contributing factor).

51. As a foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered bodily injury to her lower back, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and related damages.

52. Plaintiff’s medical expenses attributable to the incident are approximately $3,500, including but not limited to emergency care, clinical visits, diagnostic imaging, and related treatment.

53. Plaintiff lost approximately $800 in wages because she was unable to work for approximately one week due to her injury.

54. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience physical pain, discomfort, and functional limitations resulting from her back injury.

55. Plaintiff has also suffered emotional distress, anxiety, and diminished enjoyment of life as a result of the incident.

56. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover for her past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and any other compensable damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence); see also Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 871–72 (1991) (damages in negligence include pain and suffering and lost earnings).

57. Any negligence which may be attributed to Plaintiff, which is expressly denied, is less than the negligence of Defendant and therefore does not bar recovery under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute. See G.L. c. 231, § 85.

58. To the extent that the condition of the public sidewalk is implicated, Defendant, as abutting landowner who undertook control and maintenance of the sidewalk, is liable under common‑law negligence principles, consistent with Papadopoulos and cases addressing landowner duties to maintain areas of ingress and egress under their control. See Papadopoulos, 457 Mass. at 383–84; Barry v. Beverly Enters.-Mass., Inc., 418 Mass. 590, 592–94 (1994).

59. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60, and applicable Massachusetts court rules.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**NEGLIGENCE**

60. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–59 as if fully set forth herein.

61. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Premises and the abutting sidewalk, including a duty to maintain the sidewalk and walkway in a reasonably safe condition and to remedy or warn of dangerous conditions such as accumulations of snow and ice.

62. Defendant breached this duty by negligently failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or remedy the hazardous ice on the shoveled pathway, by ignoring tenant complaints and photographs, by failing to warn lawful visitors such as Plaintiff, and by otherwise failing to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition.

63. Defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous icy condition on the sidewalk and that such a condition posed a foreseeable risk of injury to lawful visitors including delivery persons such as Plaintiff.

64. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above constitute negligence under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to the standards articulated in:

   - Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010);  
   - Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973);  
   - Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995);  
   - Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983);  
   - Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000);  
   - Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013);  
   - Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333 (2010);  
   - Barry v. Beverly Enters.-Mass., Inc., 418 Mass. 590 (1994);  
   - Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312 (2002); and  
   - G.L. c. 231, § 85.

65. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the injuries and damages described above, including but not limited to bodily injury, pain and suffering, medical bills, lost wages, and other economic and non‑economic losses.

66. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation from Defendant for all such damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact, plus interest and costs as allowed by law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6C.
