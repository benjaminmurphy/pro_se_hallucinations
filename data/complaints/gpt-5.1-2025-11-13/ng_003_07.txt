JORDAN PATEL,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                   
HOME GOODS WAREHOUSE,  
    Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff, Jordan Patel (“Plaintiff” or “Mr. Patel”), for his Complaint against Defendant Home Goods Warehouse (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

                              I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Patel is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Home Goods Warehouse is a business entity organized under the laws of one or more states and at all relevant times owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled a retail “discount home-goods” store located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Store”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant conducted business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including in Middlesex County, and derived substantial revenue from its Lowell retail operations.

                        II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, placing this matter within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and applicable Massachusetts law because the cause of action arose from an incident that occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts, within Middlesex County, at Defendant’s Store located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

                          III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately midday, Plaintiff lawfully entered the Store located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852, as a business invitee and paying customer.

8. Plaintiff was in the kitchenware section of the Store browsing for kitchen items.

9. In the aisle where Plaintiff was shopping, Defendant, by and through its employees, servants, or agents, had stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances—including toaster ovens—on metal shelving units.

10. These boxes were stacked approximately five or six boxes high, above eye level, and in a manner that was unstable, unrestrained, and unsecured.

11. There were no restraining bars, safety rails, straps, nets, or other mechanisms in place to prevent boxes from falling from the upper shelves.

12. There were no warning signs in the aisle notifying customers that items above were unstable, that merchandise was stacked in a hazardous manner, or that customers should avoid bumping or contacting shelving.

13. The aisle was open to customers, and the boxes were stacked in a location and in a manner that created a foreseeable risk that normal customer activity—such as pushing a shopping cart—could cause the shelving to move and products to fall.

14. As Plaintiff was standing in the aisle looking at merchandise at about shoulder height, another customer pushed a standard shopping cart down the aisle in a normal and reasonably foreseeable manner.

15. The other customer’s cart made contact with a lower part of the shelf, causing a modest bump, not excessive, abnormal, or reckless under the circumstances.

16. Immediately following that minor contact, at least one large, heavy boxed toaster oven situated on an upper shelf fell from near the top of the shelving unit.

17. The falling box struck Plaintiff on the side of his head and on his shoulder, causing him to become dizzy and experience immediate pain and discomfort.

18. Plaintiff felt dazed, disoriented, and developed a significant headache, as well as pain and soreness in his shoulder.

19. Store personnel and a manager responded to the incident.

20. The Store manager filled out an incident report with Plaintiff and was made aware that a box had fallen from overhead shelving and struck Plaintiff.

21. Despite the seriousness of having a heavy box fall from overhead onto a customer’s head and shoulder, the manager merely offered Plaintiff a store coupon.

22. From the time of the incident until closing, Defendant, through its employees, had the ability and opportunity to inspect, correct, and/or remediate the dangerous condition that allowed the box to fall, including adjusting stocking practices, using restraints, or warning customers.

23. That same day and evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened; his dizziness increased and his headache intensified.

24. Unable to ignore the severity of his symptoms, Plaintiff went to the emergency room later that night.

25. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was examined, and medical professionals diagnosed him with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

26. Plaintiff was given instructions regarding concussion management and shoulder care and was advised to rest and avoid activities that could exacerbate his injuries, including physical labor and sports.

27. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed as a delivery driver.

28. As a direct and proximate result of the incident and his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to perform his regular job duties and was required to miss several days of work.

29. Plaintiff lost approximately $600.00 in wages as a result of his inability to work following the incident.

30. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for emergency room treatment, follow-up care, and related medical services in an amount of approximately $1,800.00 to date.

31. Prior to the incident, Plaintiff regularly played in a weekly soccer league; his concussion and shoulder strain prevented him from participating for approximately one month, depriving him of physical activity, social engagement, and enjoyment.

32. Plaintiff has suffered physical pain, headaches, shoulder pain, discomfort, and limitations in daily activities as a direct result of the incident.

33. Plaintiff has also suffered emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience arising from the sudden nature of the accident, the disruption to his work and recreational activities, and concerns about his health and financial losses.

34. At all relevant times, Defendant controlled the layout, stocking, and safety procedures of the aisle where Plaintiff was injured, including the height, manner, and stability of the stacked boxes.

35. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that stacking heavy appliance boxes five or six high on retail shelving without restraints or barriers created an unreasonable risk of harm to customers.

36. The risk that a customer’s cart might bump or contact shelving in the course of ordinary use of a retail aisle is obvious, normal, and reasonably foreseeable to a prudent store operator.

37. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that such contact could jostle the shelving and destabilize improperly stacked or unsecured boxes, causing them to fall on customers below.

38. Defendant’s failure to secure the boxes or to institute and enforce safe stocking practices created a hazardous condition that was not open and obvious to Plaintiff, who had no reason to anticipate that a minor, everyday cart bump would cause heavy merchandise above him to fall.

39. Plaintiff did not cause the boxes to be stacked in a dangerous manner, did not control the shelving, and did not act unreasonably or unsafely while browsing merchandise.

40. Plaintiff, as a business invitee, had a right to rely on Defendant to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Store in a reasonably safe condition for customers.

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care, the heavy box fell and struck Plaintiff, causing his injuries, losses, and damages.

                               IV. NEGLIGENCE  
                           (Against All Defendants)

42. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 41 as if fully set forth herein.

43. Under Massachusetts law, a store owner or occupier of land owes a duty to lawful visitors and business invitees to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect them against foreseeable risks of harm. See, e.g., Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (abandoning rigid common-law distinctions and recognizing a duty of reasonable care owed to lawful visitors); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995).

44. This duty includes the obligation to maintain aisles, shelving, and merchandise displays in a reasonably safe condition; to use reasonable care in stocking and securing merchandise; to conduct reasonable inspections; and to either remedy or warn of unreasonable risks of harm of which the defendant knows or should know. See, e.g., Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 782–84 (2007); Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

45. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful customer and business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation, maintenance, inspection, and control of the Store and, specifically, in the stacking and securing of heavy boxes of merchandise on shelving.

46. Defendant, by and through its agents, servants, and employees, breached its duty of reasonable care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

    a. Stacking heavy boxes of appliances, including toaster ovens, approximately five or six units high on shelves above customer head level;

    b. Failing to use restraints, safety rails, bars, nets, straps, or equivalent protective measures to prevent heavy boxes from falling from high shelves;

    c. Failing to secure, stabilize, or otherwise safely arrange boxes so they would not be easily dislodged by normal and foreseeable customer activity, including minor bumps to shelving from shopping carts;

    d. Failing to implement and enforce adequate policies and procedures regarding safe stocking, stacking height limits, and overhead merchandise storage in customer aisles;

    e. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees in safe stocking methods and hazard recognition relating to overhead merchandise;

    f. Failing to regularly inspect the aisles, shelving, and stacking practices to identify and correct unstable or unsafe conditions;

    g. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the hazardous condition created by the unstable stacking of heavy boxes overhead, such as through signage, restricted access, or other warnings; and

    h. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent foreseeable harm to customers in the aisle.

47. The risk that heavy boxes stacked high on retail shelving could fall and strike a customer below if the shelf were jostled or bumped by a shopping cart was reasonably foreseeable to a prudent store operator in Defendant’s position. See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 389 Mass. 47, 54–55 (1983) (duty of care shaped by reasonably foreseeable risks).

48. Defendant either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that its method of stacking boxes created an unreasonably dangerous condition. This knowledge is imputed to Defendant through its employees charged with stocking and inspecting the premises. See Thurlow v. Crossman, 336 Mass. 248, 251 (1957).

49. Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition caused by its stocking practices, because Defendant created the condition itself by stacking the heavy boxes as described, and because such a method of display inherently involved a continuing risk of falling merchandise. See Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

50. Defendant’s suggestion that a store coupon was an adequate response to a known incident in which heavy overhead merchandise struck a customer’s head and shoulder reflects an unreasonable failure to appreciate and address the seriousness of the safety hazard and Plaintiff’s injuries.

51. Defendant’s breaches of duty were a direct and proximate cause of the incident in which a heavy toaster-oven box fell and struck Plaintiff, resulting in his mild concussion and shoulder strain.

52. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including but not limited to:

    a. Mild concussion, with associated dizziness, headaches, and cognitive symptoms; and  
    b. Shoulder strain, with associated pain, limited range of motion, and functional limitation.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and continues to incur reasonable and necessary medical expenses in an amount of approximately $1,800.00 to date, and may incur additional expenses in the future. See G.L. c. 231, § 60F (recovery of medical expenses in tort actions).

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff lost wages in the approximate amount of $600.00 due to missed work as a delivery driver.

55. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer pain and suffering, including headaches, shoulder pain, discomfort, and limitations in his daily activities and recreational pursuits, such as his inability to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month. See Feltch v. Gen. Rental Co., 383 Mass. 603, 611 (1981) (damages include pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment).

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, inconvenience, and other non-economic damages compensable under Massachusetts negligence law. See Payton v. Abbott Labs, 386 Mass. 540, 555–57 (1982).

57. Plaintiff’s own conduct was at all times reasonable and did not constitute negligence, or, in the alternative, any negligence on Plaintiff’s part was less than the negligence of Defendant and does not bar recovery but, at most, would proportionally reduce damages under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85.

58. Under G.L. c. 231, § 60H, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the full measure of his tort damages, including past and future medical expenses, lost wages and earning capacity, and pain and suffering, subject to the fact-finder’s determination.

59. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff in a negligence action is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all harms proximately caused by defendant’s breach of duty, including both economic and non-economic damages. See, e.g., MacCuish v. Volkswagenwerk A.G., 22 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 397–98 (1986); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 787 (1975).

60. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment against Defendant for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and all other compensable harms, together with interest, costs, and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                          V. DAMAGES ALLEGATIONS

61. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 60 as if fully set forth herein.

62. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $1,800.00 in medical expenses to date and reasonably anticipates additional medical care or treatment related to the consequences of his concussion and shoulder injury.

63. Plaintiff has lost approximately $600.00 in wages due to missed work following the incident and the resulting limitations caused by his injuries.

64. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience physical pain and suffering, including headaches, dizziness, shoulder pain, and related symptoms.

65. Plaintiff has experienced loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal activities, including inability to play in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month and reduced ability to engage in physical and social activities.

66. Plaintiff has experienced emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish associated with the accident, his physical injuries, the disruption of his daily life and work, and concerns about his continued health and financial well-being.

67. Plaintiff seeks an amount of damages to be determined by the trier of fact, in an amount sufficient to fully and fairly compensate him for all harms suffered and to be suffered as a result of Defendant’s negligence, plus statutory interest and costs as permitted by Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions).

                         VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jordan Patel, respectfully requests that this Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Home Goods Warehouse on Plaintiff’s claim of negligence;

B. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed the jurisdictional minimum of this Court, including:

   2. Lost wages and any impairment of earning capacity;  
   3. Pain and suffering, both physical and emotional;  
   4. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with usual activities; and  
   5. Any other compensable economic and non-economic damages available under Massachusetts law;

C. Award Plaintiff prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law, including under G.L. c. 231, § 6B;
