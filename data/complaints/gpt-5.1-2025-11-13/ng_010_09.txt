SUPERIOR COURT DEPARTMENT  
OF THE TRIAL COURT

EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                              
                                                   CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

JOHN SMITH,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant John Smith (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff regularly walked along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant John Smith is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201 (the “Property”), and at all relevant times was the owner, possessor, and person in control of the Property, including the large maple tree and its limbs that extended over the adjacent public sidewalk.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for damages arising out of personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

4. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum for the Superior Court and involves a claim for personal injuries sounding in negligence.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the cause of action arose in Berkshire County, the Property is located in Berkshire County, and Defendant resides in Berkshire County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all times relevant, Defendant owned, controlled, and/or was responsible for the maintenance of the Property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

7. A large, mature maple tree was located on or immediately adjacent to the Property, such that a substantial limb or branch of the tree extended over the public sidewalk used by pedestrians along Maple Street.

8. For a significant period of time before August 15, 2023, the large limb extending over the sidewalk appeared visibly cracked, drooping, and structurally compromised.

9. Plaintiff personally observed that the overhanging limb appeared cracked and droopy and noticed its hazardous condition during her regular walks along the sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street.

10. Neighbors and residents in the vicinity of 123 Maple Street also observed that the tree limb appeared cracked, weakened, and dangerous, and they reasonably believed that the limb posed a risk of falling onto pedestrians using the sidewalk.

11. Prior to August 15, 2023, one or more neighbors informed Defendant about the hazardous condition of the cracked and drooping limb, advised him that the limb was dangerous, and suggested that he have the tree inspected and/or pruned by a qualified arborist or tree professional.

12. In response to these warnings, Defendant acknowledged the condition and, upon information and belief, told the neighbors that he would “deal with it in the spring” or words to that effect.

13. Despite actual notice of the hazardous condition of the limb and the foreseeable risk of serious injury to pedestrians, Defendant failed to have the tree inspected, failed to have the dangerous limb removed or stabilized, and otherwise failed to take reasonable steps to remedy or guard against the danger.

14. Defendant had ample time and opportunity, over many weeks or months prior to August 15, 2023, to address the dangerous condition of the cracked and drooping limb.

15. On or about August 15, 2023, during a typical summer thunderstorm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, carrying grocery bags.

16. The weather conditions on August 15, 2023, included a fairly ordinary summer thunderstorm, with rain and wind, but no tornado warnings, no extraordinary weather phenomena, and no conditions so unusual or extreme as to be considered an unforeseeable “Act of God.”

17. While Plaintiff was walking along the sidewalk in the exercise of due care, the previously cracked and drooping limb snapped and fell from the maple tree, striking Plaintiff on her shoulder and back and knocking her to the ground.

18. As a direct and proximate result of the falling limb, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries including, but not limited to, a shoulder strain and multiple bruises to her back and body.

19. Plaintiff experienced immediate pain, shock, and distress and thereafter sought medical evaluation and treatment for her injuries.

20. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for diagnosis, treatment, and follow‑up related to her injuries from the incident.

21. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed in retail and, as a direct result of her injuries, was unable to work for approximately one week.

22. Plaintiff lost approximately $400 in wages and income during the period she was unable to work due to the injuries caused by the falling limb.

23. In addition to economic losses, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, limitations in the use of her shoulder and back, emotional distress, anxiety when walking under trees or in inclement weather, and a diminished enjoyment of her daily activities.

24. Plaintiff was at all times relevant a lawful pedestrian on a public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant’s Property and did not contribute in any way to the creation of the hazardous condition.

25. The hazardous condition of the cracked and drooping limb was reasonably discoverable upon inspection by a person of ordinary prudence and was, in fact, known to Defendant before the incident.

26. The dangerous condition of the tree limb was not the result of a sudden, hidden, or latent defect arising immediately before the incident; rather, it existed for a substantial period of time, during which Defendant had actual notice and an opportunity to correct the condition.

27. The limb did not fall solely by reason of an unforeseeable natural disaster; instead, the limb failed under relatively ordinary storm conditions that were reasonably foreseeable in Massachusetts in the summer season.

28. Defendant’s failure to act on the known hazardous condition of the limb, despite reasonable opportunity to do so, directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

29. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully set forth herein.

30. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner or person in control of premises owes a duty to all lawful entrants and users of adjacent public ways, including pedestrians on public sidewalks, to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition and to prevent foreseeable harm caused by conditions on the property that present an unreasonable risk of injury.  
   See, e.g., *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (abolishing distinction between invitees and licensees and recognizing unified duty of reasonable care); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995) (duty extends to preventing foreseeable harm to persons on adjacent ways).

31. This duty extends to artificial and natural conditions on the land, including trees and overhanging limbs that pose a foreseeable risk of falling onto public sidewalks and injuring pedestrians.  
   See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. at 743–44 (duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm from conditions on land); *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196, 198–99 (1994) (duty of reasonable care in maintaining premises, including conditions abutting public ways).

32. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of 123 Maple Street and the subject maple tree and overhanging limb, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in inspecting, maintaining, and repairing the tree and to take reasonable measures to prevent the tree or its limbs from falling onto the adjacent public sidewalk.

33. Defendant further had a duty to use reasonable care to prevent an unreasonable risk of harm arising from a condition on his land when he knew or reasonably should have known that such condition posed a foreseeable risk of injury to persons lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk.  
   See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (duty where risk of harm is foreseeable and reasonable person would act to prevent it); *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 730–32 (2000) (question of negligence based on foreseeability of harm under particular weather conditions).

34. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care in numerous respects, including but not limited to the following:

   a. Failing to properly inspect the maple tree and its overhanging limb for signs of decay, cracking, or structural weakness, despite the limb’s visibly cracked and drooping appearance;

   b. Failing to timely engage a qualified arborist or tree professional to evaluate the condition of the limb once put on actual notice of its hazardous condition;

   c. Failing to remove, prune, brace, or otherwise remedy the cracked and drooping limb, despite having actual knowledge that the limb posed a danger to pedestrians on the sidewalk;

   d. Failing to warn pedestrians or restrict access to the area under the dangerous limb, despite knowing that lawful pedestrians, including Plaintiff, regularly used the sidewalk;

   e. Failing to take any reasonable steps to address a known dangerous condition over a prolonged period of time after neighbors notified Defendant of the risk;

   f. Failing to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

35. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care owed by a reasonably prudent property owner in Massachusetts and constituted negligence under the principles articulated in *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. at 707–08, and subsequent cases.

36. Defendant’s liability is not negated by the fact that the limb fell during a storm because the risk that a cracked and drooping limb would fall under typical Massachusetts summer storm conditions was plainly foreseeable and, indeed, was specifically brought to Defendant’s attention.  
   See *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. at 731–32 (reasonableness of defendant’s conduct in light of known risk and weather conditions is typically for the jury); *Flood v. Southland Corp.*, 416 Mass. 62, 71 (1993) (foreseeability of harm is central to negligence analysis).

37. The presence of wind and rain on August 15, 2023, does not constitute an unforeseeable “Act of God” relieving Defendant of liability because the weather was within the range of conditions reasonably anticipated in the area, and Defendant’s prior negligence in failing to address the defective limb was a substantial factor in causing the limb to fall.  
   See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640–41 (1996) (liability where defendant fails to take reasonable measures to address known or foreseeable risks from natural conditions); *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 302, § 302A (negligent conduct may create risk magnified by natural forces).

38. Defendant had both actual and constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the limb. Neighbors specifically alerted Defendant to the cracked, drooping limb and suggested he consult an arborist, and the condition was observable and would have been discovered upon reasonable inspection.  
   See *Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (notice may be actual or constructive where condition exists for sufficient time and is readily observable).

39. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s recovery is not barred unless her negligence, if any, was greater than the total negligence attributable to Defendant. Plaintiff at all times exercised reasonable care for her own safety and was lawfully using the public sidewalk; any suggestion of comparative negligence is unsupported by the facts.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries including, but not limited to, a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, with associated pain, suffering, and limitations in movement and daily activities.

41. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for the diagnosis and treatment of her injuries. Plaintiff is entitled to recover these expenses under Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest on personal injury damages).

42. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff lost approximately $400 in wages from her retail employment when she was unable to work for approximately one week due to her injuries. Such lost wages constitute recoverable economic damages.

43. Plaintiff has also sustained and will continue to sustain non‑economic damages, including physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, all proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence.  
    See *Griffin v. General Motors Corp.*, 380 Mass. 362, 365 (1980) (pain and suffering as element of damages).

44. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including past and future pain and suffering, past and future medical expenses, past and future loss of earning capacity, and any other compensable losses under Massachusetts law.  
    See *McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Norton Co.*, 408 Mass. 704, 717 (1990) (measure of damages is to place plaintiff as nearly as possible in position she would have been in absent tort).
