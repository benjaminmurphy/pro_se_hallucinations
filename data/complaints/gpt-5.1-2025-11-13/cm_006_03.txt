v.

  Defendant / Father.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time – Material Change in Circumstances)  
__________________________________________  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an adult individual residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children who are the subject of this action:  
   - Emily Johnson, born [DOB], age 10; and  
   - Lucas Johnson, born [DOB], age 8.  

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Defendant” or “Father”), is an adult individual, believed to reside in or near Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and is the father of said minor children.

3. This Court has proper jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, and 31, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as the Berkshire Probate and Family Court issued the existing custody order and the children reside within the Commonwealth.

4. A Judgment/Order concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor children was entered by this Court on March 15, 2021 (“Existing Judgment”).

5. Under the Existing Judgment, the Plaintiff was granted primary physical custody of the minor children, with the Defendant receiving parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit each week.

6. At the time the Existing Judgment was entered, neither party was in a serious cohabiting relationship, and the Court’s order did not address the presence of new romantic partners or other adults in the children’s environment during the Defendant’s parenting time.

7. Venue is proper in this Court as the prior order was entered here and the minor children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 29, and G.L. c. 215, § 6.

### II. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

8. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time order upon a showing of (a) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment, and (b) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See also *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 370–371 (1981); *Cooper v. Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134–135 (2004).

9. In determining custody and parenting time, “the happiness and welfare of the children” and their best interests are paramount. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–842 (2003).

10. The Court has broad equitable powers to impose conditions on parenting time to protect a child’s best interests, including supervised visitation or restrictions on contact with third parties when necessary to safeguard the children from harm or exposure to domestic violence or instability. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649, 658–659 (2002); *Malachi M. v. Quintina Q.*, 483 Mass. 725, 736–738 (2019).

11. Massachusetts law explicitly recognizes the significance of domestic violence and a child’s exposure to abusive or coercive behavior in custody determinations. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 31A (requiring consideration of abusive behavior and creating a rebuttable presumption against awarding custody to a parent who has a pattern or serious incident of abuse); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–597 (1996); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610, 620–622 (1986).

12. The Court may modify parenting arrangements where the new living situation or the presence of other adults in a parent’s home presents risk to the children, causes instability, or undermines their safety and emotional well-being. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840–843; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 265–266 (2001); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–186 (2006).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

13. Since the entry of the Existing Judgment on March 15, 2021, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances relating to the Defendant’s household and the environment to which the children are exposed during his parenting time.

14. Specifically, the Defendant has begun cohabiting with a new romantic partner (hereinafter “New Partner”), whose presence in the home and behavior around the children were not contemplated at the time of the Existing Judgment.

15. Upon information and belief, the New Partner has a criminal record, including at least one conviction or charge for assault and battery, and was previously the subject of a restraining order issued in favor of a former girlfriend pursuant to G.L. c. 209A (Abuse Prevention).

16. The existence of a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior abuse prevention order is strongly indicative of a history of violence or domestic abuse, which bears directly on the safety and welfare of children exposed to that individual. See G.L. c. 209A; G.L. c. 208, § 31A; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–597.

17. The minor children, Emily and Lucas, have reported to the Plaintiff that the New Partner frequently yells, raises his/her voice, and slams doors in the Defendant’s residence during the times when the children are present.

18. The children have further reported that on at least one occasion, the New Partner grabbed one of the children by the arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark.

19. Exposure to such behavior—angry yelling, slamming doors, and physically forceful contact—constitutes a form of emotional abuse and potential physical abuse, which is contrary to the children’s welfare and safety, and is a factor that this Court must consider in any custody and parenting-time determination. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–597; *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. at 620–622.

20. On at least one occasion, during a loud argument involving the New Partner while the children were present in the home, a neighbor called the police to respond to the residence.

21. The involvement of the police in addressing domestic conflicts or loud altercations in the children’s presence is a serious development that did not exist at the time of the Existing Judgment and that materially alters the risk profile of the Defendant’s household.

22. The Defendant’s decision to reside with, and expose the children to, an adult who has a criminal history of assault and battery and a prior restraining order, and who engages in loud, aggressive, and potentially physically abusive behavior in the children’s presence, creates an unsafe and unstable environment for Emily and Lucas.

23. The children have expressed fear and anxiety related to the New Partner’s behavior, which has affected their sense of security during visits with the Defendant and their emotional well‑being overall.

24. The introduction of this New Partner, and the pattern of conduct described above, constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since the March 15, 2021 order, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and Massachusetts case law. See *Schuler*, 382 Mass. at 370–371; *Cooper*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. at 134–135; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840–842.

25. This material change in circumstances directly implicates the best interests of the minor children and requires this Court to re‑examine the existing parenting-time arrangement in order to ensure the safety and welfare of Emily and Lucas. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–186.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

26. The best interests of Emily and Lucas require that they be protected from exposure to violence, threats of violence, or a pattern of aggressive or intimidating behavior in their home environment. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 31, 31A; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–597.

27. The current parenting-time provisions, which permit the Defendant to exercise parenting time in the presence of the New Partner without any conditions or supervision, place the children at risk of further physical and emotional harm and adversely affect their emotional security and well‑being.

28. The Court has both the authority and the responsibility to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time when necessary to protect the children, including requiring supervised parenting time or prohibiting contact between the children and particular adults who pose a risk to them. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; *Blixt*, 437 Mass. at 658–659; *Malachi M.*, 483 Mass. at 736–738; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 265–266.

29. It is in the children’s best interests that their relationship with the Defendant continue, but under circumstances that prioritize their safety and protect them from further exposure to potentially abusive or volatile behavior by the New Partner or any other adult in the Defendant’s household.

30. A modified order limiting the New Partner’s presence around the children during the Defendant’s parenting time, or in the alternative requiring that the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by an appropriate third party or professional visitation center, is narrowly tailored, reasonably necessary, and consistent with the statutory mandate to protect children from exposure to abuse and domestic violence. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31A; *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. at 620–622; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–186.

31. The requested modification does not seek to terminate the Defendant’s relationship with the minor children, but rather to ensure that such contact occurs in a safe, stable, and non‑abusive environment consistent with the children’s emotional and physical needs.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the March 15, 2021 Judgment regarding custody and parenting time, specifically arising from:  
   (1) the Defendant’s cohabitation with an individual who has a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order;  
   (2) the New Partner’s ongoing verbal aggression, yelling, and door‑slamming in the children’s presence;  
   (3) the New Partner’s physical grabbing of one of the children, causing a mark; and  
   (4) the involvement of the police in at least one incident arising from a loud argument while the children were present.

B. Find that the continued exposure of the minor children to the New Partner’s conduct in the Defendant’s home is contrary to the children’s best interests and poses a risk to their physical and emotional well‑being.

C. Modify the Existing Judgment of March 15, 2021, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, and 31A, to include the following terms (or substantially similar terms as the Court deems appropriate):

   1. That during all parenting time exercised by the Defendant with Emily Johnson and Lucas Johnson, the New Partner shall not be present in the home, vehicle, or vicinity where the children are present, and shall have no in‑person, telephone, electronic, or other contact with the minor children;  

   2. In the alternative, if the Court does not order the above restriction, that all of the Defendant’s parenting time with the minor children be supervised by an appropriate third‑party supervisor or professional visitation center, with the New Partner prohibited from attending or being present at or near such visits;  

   3. That the Defendant shall not permit any individual with a current or prior restraining order for domestic abuse, or a criminal record that includes violent offenses or offenses involving assault and battery, to reside in the same household with the children or to be present during the Defendant’s parenting time, absent further order of the Court;  

   4. That the Defendant shall immediately notify the Plaintiff and, where appropriate, the Court of any new incidents involving police response, restraining orders, or criminal charges arising from conduct in the Defendant’s household while the children are present.

D. Confirm the Plaintiff’s primary physical custody of the children, and leave all other provisions of the March 15, 2021 order in full force and effect except as specifically modified by the Court.

E. Grant such additional and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor children, including but not limited to orders for:  
   - any necessary counseling for the children related to their exposure to conflict or aggression; and  
   - any other protective conditions on parenting time that the Court finds warranted on the evidence.
