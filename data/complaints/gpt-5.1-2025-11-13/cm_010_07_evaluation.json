However, it does not set out, adopt, or list the multi-factor best-interests test described in the proposition (age, relationship with each parent, capacity to provide, home stability, effect of changes, preference). Its best-interests discussion is narrower and focused mainly on sibling relationships and family placement, so it does not provide authority for the full factor list claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThis court has said that the \u2018parental fitness\u2019 test and the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 test are not mutually exclusive, but rather \u2018reflect different degrees of emphasis on the same factors.\u2019 \u2026 In this case, the judge\u2019s task was not complete once he had determined that the mother should not have custody of her children. Also, he should have addressed the various placement options which would further the children\u2019s best interests\u2026 The judge\u2019s findings in this case are deficient in that he failed to address two issues: the importance of the sibling relationship, and whether placement of all three children with the paternal grandparents would be in the best interests of the children.\u201d"
