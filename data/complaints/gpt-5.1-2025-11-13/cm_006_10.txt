COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF JUDGMENT  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME / CONDITIONS OF CONTACT)


NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Liam Johnson (born __________) and Ava Johnson (born __________) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of the Norfolk Probate and Family Court (“this Court”) pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6, and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, and related statutes governing custody and parenting orders involving minor children.

4. On or about May 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time for the Children (“the 2021 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2021 Judgment, Mother has primary physical custody of the Children. Father has parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit each week.

6. When the 2021 Judgment issued, neither party was in a serious relationship, and there was no evidence before the Court concerning the presence of other adult household members, nor any need for provisions regarding third-party caregivers, cohabitants, or new partners.

7. This Court has continuing jurisdiction to modify custody and parenting-time provisions upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where the requested modification is in the best interests of the minor children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; G.L. c. 208, § 31; and cases such as *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).


### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS – MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, Father has begun cohabiting with a new partner (hereinafter “Father’s Partner”), who now regularly resides in Father’s household and is present during Father’s parenting time with the Children.

9. Upon information and belief, Father’s Partner has a criminal record, including at least one conviction for assault and battery. Exposure of minor children to a household member with a known violent history constitutes a material change in circumstances directly bearing on the Children’s safety and welfare.

10. Upon information and belief, Father’s Partner has been the subject of at least one prior restraining order (abuse prevention order) issued under G.L. c. 209A by a court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, arising from alleged domestic violence or abuse against a prior intimate partner.

11. The Children have reported to Mother that Father’s Partner frequently yells, screams, and slams doors while they are present in the home, causing significant emotional distress and fear for the Children.

12. The Children have further reported that on at least one occasion Father’s Partner grabbed one of the Children with such force that it left a visible mark on the Child’s arm.

13. The behavior described in Paragraphs 11 and 12 reasonably suggests that the Children may be at risk of physical and emotional harm in Father’s home environment as currently constituted, and that their safety and emotional well‑being require immediate attention and protection from this Court.

14. On at least one occasion, a neighbor called the police due to a loud argument occurring at or near Father’s residence while the Children were present, further evidencing a volatile and potentially unsafe environment for the Children.

15. None of these facts existed, were known, or could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the 2021 Judgment. The introduction of Father’s Partner into the Children’s lives under these circumstances constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior order.

16. The safety and best interests of the Children are the paramount concern of this Court under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

17. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a modification of a custody or parenting plan is warranted when a material and substantial change in circumstances makes the existing judgment inconsistent with the best interests of the child. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

18. Exposure of children to violence, a history of abuse, or an environment of intimidation, yelling, or physical aggression is contrary to their best interests and weighs heavily in favor of judicial intervention and protective conditions on parenting time. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 31, 31A (requiring consideration of patterns of abuse); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Care and Protection of Rebecca*, 419 Mass. 67 (1994).

19. Allowing an individual with a documented history of assaultive conduct and a prior G.L. c. 209A restraining order to have unsupervised access to the Children, in the context of repeated yelling and at least one physical incident that left a mark on a Child, creates a substantial risk of physical and emotional harm to the Children.

20. The 2021 Judgment did not contemplate or address any conditions regarding Father’s live‑in partners, third‑party supervision, or the exclusion of unsafe adults from the Children’s presence. Given the new circumstances, the existing schedule and lack of protective provisions are no longer consistent with the Children’s best interests.

21. The requested modification is focused and limited: Mother does not seek to terminate Father’s relationship with the Children, but seeks appropriate conditions to ensure their safety and emotional well‑being during Father’s parenting time.

22. Establishing conditions to protect the Children from exposure to violence, emotional abuse, or physically aggressive conduct is consistent with the statutory mandate that the Court consider the best interests of the child above all else, including the child’s safety and welfare. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 31, 31A; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).


### III. APPLICABLE LAW

23. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 209C, § 10, this Court may modify any prior judgment regarding custody or parenting time upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); *Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. 20 (1981).

24. The “best interests of the child” standard is the touchstone for decisions involving custody and parenting time in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

25. The Court is specifically required to consider evidence of abuse, patterns of domestic violence, and the safety of the child when making or modifying custody and parenting arrangements. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 209A; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Care and Protection of Rebecca*, 419 Mass. 67 (1994).

26. Massachusetts courts have recognized that changes in the home environment, including the presence of new adult household members and exposure to conflict or violence, can constitute a material change warranting modification of an existing custody or parenting‑time judgment. See *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).

27. The Court has broad equitable power to craft appropriate conditions on visitation and parenting time, including restrictions on contact with particular third parties and requirements for supervised parenting time, to safeguard the child’s welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Vinson v. Vinson*, 364 Mass. 491 (1974); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).

28. In light of the foregoing authorities, the allegations in this Complaint establish both a material change in circumstances and that the requested conditions are reasonably necessary and narrowly tailored to protect the Children’s best interests while preserving Father’s relationship with them.


### IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION AND RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Court:

A. FIND that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment, specifically including but not limited to:

   1. Father’s commencement of cohabitation with Father’s Partner, who has a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order under G.L. c. 209A;  
   2. Reports by the Children of frequent yelling, door‑slamming, and volatile behavior by Father’s Partner in their presence;  
   3. At least one incident in which Father’s Partner grabbed one of the Children with sufficient force to leave a mark; and  
   4. Police being called to Father’s residence during a loud argument while the Children were present.

B. FIND that, in light of these changed circumstances, the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions of the 2021 Judgment are no longer consistent with the Children’s best interests.

C. MODIFY the May 15, 2021 Judgment to include one or more of the following conditions, as the Court deems appropriate to protect the Children:

   1. That Father’s Partner shall not be present in the same residence, vehicle, or place as the Children during Father’s parenting time, including overnights and exchanges; **or, in the alternative,**  
   2. That all of Father’s parenting time with the Children shall be supervised by a neutral third party or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, with Father’s Partner having no contact with the Children;  
   3. That Father shall not permit any person with a history of assaultive conduct or a prior G.L. c. 209A restraining order involving domestic violence to have unsupervised contact with the Children;  
   4. That Father shall immediately notify Mother, and if ordered, the Court or a guardian ad litem, of any new adult who regularly spends overnights in his household or assumes a caregiving role for the Children;  
   5. Such further or different conditions regarding exchanges, communication, and the presence of third parties as the Court deems necessary to protect the Children’s physical and emotional safety.

D. CLARIFY that, except as specifically modified by the Court’s new order, all other provisions of the May 15, 2021 Judgment shall remain in full force and effect.

E. AWARD such further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests and safety of the Children, including, if appropriate, temporary orders under G.L. c. 208, § 28 or related authority during the pendency of this Complaint.
