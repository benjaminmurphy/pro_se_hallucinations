### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Stevens (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, at all relevant times, was lawfully present in the public park area at or near Hammond Pond Parkway, Newton, Massachusetts 02467.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mark Stevens is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who regularly uses the park area at or near Hammond Pond Parkway in Newton, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, kept, and controlled a large dog (“the Dog”).

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of Massachusetts.

4. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 21, the Newton Division of the District Court Department has jurisdiction over this civil action, as the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 and 3, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, and because Defendant resides in and/or may be found within this judicial district.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately afternoon hours, Plaintiff was jogging on a designated pedestrian path in the park area adjacent to or near Hammond Pond Parkway, Newton, Massachusetts 02467 (the “Park”).

7. The Park contained posted signs stating that all dogs must be kept on leashes at all times.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant was present in the Park with the Dog, a large dog that, upon information and belief, Defendant regularly allowed to run off‑leash despite the posted leash requirements.

9. On the date of the incident, Defendant had a leash physically with him and, at the time of the events described below, was holding the leash over his shoulder, but the leash was not attached to the Dog.

10. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from Plaintiff, conversing with friends, and was not maintaining physical control over the Dog.

11. As Plaintiff was jogging along the path, the Dog suddenly and rapidly charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly, in a manner that a reasonable person would perceive as aggressive and threatening.

12. Plaintiff, observing the Dog charging and barking, reasonably feared that the Dog was about to bite or otherwise attack her.

13. At the time, no barrier, fence, or physical restraint prevented the Dog from reaching Plaintiff; the Dog was completely off leash and at liberty to make physical contact with her.

14. In order to avoid what she reasonably believed to be an imminent dog attack, Plaintiff instinctively swerved off the paved path, away from the Dog’s line of approach.

15. As Plaintiff swerved off the path, she encountered uneven ground and a protruding tree root, causing her to trip.

16. Plaintiff then fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path, landing forcefully on her wrist and sustaining serious injury.

17. The Dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff, but stopped when Plaintiff fell, and only then did Defendant call the Dog back to him.

18. Several other joggers and park users witnessed the incident, including the Dog’s charge, Defendant’s distance from and lack of control over the Dog, Plaintiff’s evasive movement, and her subsequent fall and injury.

19. Immediately following the fall, Plaintiff experienced significant pain in her wrist and other discomfort.

20. Plaintiff sought emergency medical treatment and was evaluated at an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with a fractured wrist.

21. Plaintiff was required to wear a brace for several weeks and to limit the use of her injured wrist, causing pain, disability, and interference with her daily activities.

22. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses, including emergency room care, diagnostic imaging, follow‑up visits, and related medical treatment.

23. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to missed work.

24. Plaintiff also missed a piano recital for which she had been preparing, and her injuries limited or prevented her from practicing the piano—an important personal and recreational activity—causing her loss of enjoyment of life.

25. Plaintiff has endured, and continues to endure, physical pain, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of normal activities, all as a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s conduct.

---

## IV. NEGLIGENCE (SOLE CAUSE OF ACTION)

26. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 25 as if fully set forth herein.

### Duty

27. Under Massachusetts common law, every person owes a duty of reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (duty arises where reasonable person would recognize conduct creates risk of harm); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages); **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739, 742–43 (1995) (duty determined by foreseeability of risk).

28. Defendant, as the owner and keeper of the Dog, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control and supervision of the Dog, particularly in a public park frequented by joggers, pedestrians, and other members of the public. See **Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.**, 283 Mass. 158, 161–62 (1933) (keepers of animals must exercise reasonable care to prevent harm); **Maillet v. Mininno**, 266 Mass. 86, 89–90 (1929) (owner of dog liable where failure to control animal creates foreseeable risk).

29. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to comply with applicable state and local laws and regulations requiring that dogs in the Park be kept on a leash, including but not limited to G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157 and any Newton ordinances adopting and enforcing leash requirements. Breach of such statutes and ordinances is evidence of negligence. See **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990) (violation of safety statute is evidence of negligence); **Adamian v. Three Sons, Inc.**, 353 Mass. 498, 499–501 (1968).

### Breach

30. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff by, among other acts and omissions:

   a. Allowing the Dog to run at large in a public park in violation of posted leash requirements and applicable law;  

   b. Failing to attach the leash to the Dog while in an area open to the public and used by joggers and pedestrians;  

   c. Failing to maintain proper supervision and control of the Dog, including remaining approximately thirty (30) feet away and engaged in conversation with friends instead of closely monitoring and restraining the Dog;  

   d. Permitting the Dog to charge and bark loudly at a passing jogger, thereby creating a reasonably foreseeable risk that the jogger would take evasive action and be injured; and  

   e. Failing to timely recall or restrain the Dog before it charged and frightened Plaintiff.

31. A reasonably prudent dog owner in Defendant’s position, knowing that the Park required dogs to be leashed and that joggers and pedestrians regularly used the path, would have kept the Dog on a leash and under close control to prevent the Dog from charging at others.

32. Defendant’s disregard of the posted leash rules and his failure to maintain physical control of the Dog constituted a breach of his duty of reasonable care. See **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84, 88 (1988) (failure to exercise reasonable care under circumstances is breach); **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. at 146–49 (failure to control dangerous instrumentality in light of foreseeable risk is negligence).

### Causation (Cause in Fact and Proximate Cause)

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Dog charged at Plaintiff, barking loudly and rapidly moving toward her.

34. Plaintiff’s perception that the Dog was about to attack was reasonable and foreseeable under the circumstances, given the Dog’s size, sudden charge, and loud barking, combined with Defendant’s lack of physical control.

35. Plaintiff’s instinctive reaction—swerving off the path to escape what she reasonably believed to be an imminent attack—was a foreseeable response to Defendant’s negligent failure to control the Dog. See **Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG**, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (negligent actor liable for harm resulting from foreseeable reactions to danger created); **Kent v. Commonwealth**, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002) (proximate cause includes harms that are within the scope of foreseeable risk).

36. Plaintiff’s fall after tripping over a tree root and down a small embankment was a direct and natural consequence of her evasive maneuver induced by Defendant’s negligence.

37. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable where their negligence is a substantial contributing factor in bringing about the plaintiff’s harm, even if other events (such as tripping over a root) also contributed. See **Doull v. Foster**, 487 Mass. 1, 12–13 (2021) (substantial factor concept and but‑for causation in negligence); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. at 696–97.

38. Defendant’s negligence was a “but for” cause of Plaintiff’s injuries: but for Defendant’s failure to leash and control the Dog, the Dog would not have charged at Plaintiff, Plaintiff would not have been forced to take evasive action, and she would not have fallen and fractured her wrist.

39. The kind of injury Plaintiff suffered—physical injury from evasive action taken to avoid a charging dog—is within the scope of risks that make Defendant’s conduct negligent. See **Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996) (foreseeable consequences of negligent conduct fall within scope of liability); **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. at 147–49.

40. That the Dog did not physically touch Plaintiff does not break the chain of causation; Massachusetts law recognizes that a defendant may be liable where their negligence causes a plaintiff to take reasonable evasive action resulting in injury. See **Solimene**, 399 Mass. at 794–95; **Restatement (Second) of Torts** §§ 443–447 (persuasive authority frequently cited by Massachusetts courts regarding intervening and superseding causes).

### Damages

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist and related physical injuries.

42. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses, including, but not limited to, emergency room treatment, diagnostic imaging, follow‑up care, and medically necessary bracing and therapy.

43. Plaintiff lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability to work for a period of time following her injury.

44. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and limitations in using her wrist and hand, including difficulty with daily tasks and recreational activities such as playing the piano.

45. Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life, including missing a piano recital and being unable to pursue normal social, recreational, and personal activities during her recovery.

46. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience emotional distress, anxiety, and fear associated with dogs and jogging in public parks, all as a foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligent conduct.

47. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover all reasonably foreseeable damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. See **Haddad v. Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. (No. 1)**, 455 Mass. 91, 99–100 (2009); **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. at 696–97.

48. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to additional evidence of damages as may be obtained through discovery.

---

## V. COMPLIANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS LAW AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES

49. This action is brought under the common law of negligence of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as recognized in, inter alia, **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694 (2000); **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141 (2006); **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739 (1995); **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988); and **Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG**, 399 Mass. 790 (1987).

50. The existence and scope of Defendant’s duty are further informed by Massachusetts statutes regulating the keeping of dogs, including G.L. c. 140, §§ 155–157, and by local leash laws and ordinances in Newton, Massachusetts, the violation of which constitutes evidence of negligence. See **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355 (1990); **Adamian v. Three Sons, Inc.**, 353 Mass. 498 (1968).

51. The elements of Plaintiff’s negligence claim—duty, breach, causation, and damages—are satisfied as set forth above, in accordance with Massachusetts case law, including but not limited to **Glidden**, **Jupin**, **Davis**, **Toubiana**, **Solimene**, **Doull**, **Kent**, **Poskus**, **Maillet**, and **Andrews**.
