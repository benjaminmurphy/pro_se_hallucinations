However, it does not address multiple (double or treble) damages for reckless or knowing violations\u2014\u00a7 14 only provides a choice between actual/consequential damages and three months\u2019 rent, not up to three times actual damages. The opinion also assumes representation by counsel and discusses fees only in that context; it does not consider whether a self-represented plaintiff may recover attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, the case does not support the specific proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that a lessor who commits any act in violation of that section (including interference \u2018with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises\u2019) shall \u2018be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u2019 \u2026 Section 14 allows a minimum recovery of three months\u2019 rent as an incentive to the pursuit of relief where the actual and consequential damages are slight or are difficult to prove. When the actual damages exceed three months\u2019 rent, however, \u00a7 14 plainly states that actual damages should be the measure of recovery.\u201d"

Leardi squarely holds that inclusion of deceptive, unlawful lease clauses regarding habitability and sanitary-code rights violates c. 93A and constitutes an \u201cinjury\u201d even absent actual damages, and highlights the court\u2019s \u201czealous\u201d protection of tenants and the seriousness of landlord noncompliance with legal obligations.

Reasonable relief, \u2018in relation to the injury,\u2019 would only be afforded by an agreement to remove the offensive clauses.\u201d"
