    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Marcus Greenfield (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is a tenant of the residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Unit ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Marcus Greenfield is an individual doing business as a residential landlord in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and/or lessor of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14 for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. The amount in controversy is $2,000, exclusive of interest, costs, and any attorneys’ fees permitted by statute or common law, which is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court. See G.L. c. 218, § 19.

5. Venue is proper in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, and the cause of action arose there. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 2, 8.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts (the “Tenancy”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Premises as her primary residence since on or about June 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of $2,200 to Defendant pursuant to the Tenancy.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the owner, landlord, and/or person entitled to receive rent for the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

9. As a matter of Massachusetts common law and statute, every residential lease and tenancy-at-will includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteeing that the tenant’s possession of the premises will not be substantially interfered with by the acts or omissions of the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s authority. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Westland Housing Corp. v. Scott, 312 Mass. 375 (1942); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

10. Beginning approximately in or about early October 2025, Defendant caused or permitted extensive renovation and construction work to be performed in the residential unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises (the “Renovation Work”).

11. The Renovation Work has included, among other things, frequent and loud drilling, hammering, use of power tools, and loud conversations and noise by construction workers in close proximity to Plaintiff’s unit.

12. The Renovation Work has typically occurred five days per week, from approximately 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, and has continued on an almost daily basis for approximately two months as of the date of this Complaint, with Defendant or his agents indicating that the work is anticipated to continue for at least an additional one to two months.

13. Plaintiff works from home in the Premises and is required to participate in telephone calls, video conferences, and focused computer work throughout the business day.

14. The noise from the Renovation Work has been so loud, frequent, and continuous during the workday that Plaintiff has repeatedly had difficulty hearing and being heard during work calls, has been distracted from her work, and has been forced on multiple occasions to rearrange or attempt to reschedule work obligations to avoid the noisiest periods of construction.

15. In addition to the noise, dust and debris from the Renovation Work have entered Plaintiff’s Premises through the building ventilation system and/or shared openings, causing visible dust accumulation in her living space and requiring additional cleaning and creating discomfort and concern about air quality.

16. Defendant did inform Plaintiff in advance that renovation would be occurring in the neighboring unit; however, Defendant did not provide any meaningful plan to mitigate the noise, dust, or duration of the Renovation Work, despite knowing that Plaintiff lived and worked in the Premises on a full-time basis.

17. Despite the foreseeably substantial impact of the Renovation Work on Plaintiff’s use of the Premises, Defendant has allowed the work to continue in a manner and for a duration that has unreasonably and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

18. The disruption from the Renovation Work has not been merely occasional or de minimis; it has been frequent, sustained, and directly caused by construction activities undertaken by or on behalf of Defendant in the course of improving Defendant’s property.

19. The level and duration of noise and dust have gone beyond what an ordinary tenant in a residential setting would reasonably be expected to tolerate and have effectively deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment and reasonable use of her home during most of the normal working day.

20. Plaintiff has made Defendant aware of the extent of the disruption to her work and daily life caused by the Renovation Work.

21. In response, Defendant offered Plaintiff only a one-time reduction of approximately $100 off a single month’s rent, which is minimal compared to the ongoing disruption and interference with Plaintiff’s daily life and work for multiple months.

22. Defendant has otherwise failed and refused to take adequate steps to limit, schedule, or buffer the Renovation Work to prevent substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises, despite having the ability to do so through scheduling, scope, or noise-mitigation measures.

23. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, frustration, inconvenience, and disruption of her work for a prolonged period of time.

24. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $2,000 in damages in the form of diminished rental value and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.

25. Plaintiff has at all relevant times been ready, willing, and able to comply with her obligations under the Tenancy and has not engaged in conduct that would justify or excuse Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

26. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–25 above as if fully set forth herein.

27. Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, provides in pertinent part that any lessor or landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

28. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy and prohibits the landlord from substantially interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises by acts or omissions under the landlord’s control. See Westland Housing Corp. v. Scott, 312 Mass. 375 (1942); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

29. A landlord may be liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s acts or omissions, or those of persons acting under the landlord’s authority, create substantial and ongoing disturbances that significantly impair the tenant’s use of the premises, even if the landlord did not specifically intend the disturbance. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–718 (1977) (landlord liable where he created conditions leading to recurring noise from adjacent lounge); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–286 (1994) (landlord liable where failure to act allowed continuing interference).

30. A substantial and unreasonable level of noise, dust, or other construction-related disturbance emanating from another part of a landlord’s property, when allowed to persist for a significant period and materially affecting the tenant’s ability to use the premises as a residence, constitutes an indirect interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (rescript) (affirming tenant relief where landlord’s acts caused substantial interference).

31. The protections of G.L. c. 186, § 14, apply broadly and are construed liberally in favor of tenants. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–106 (1982) (statute to be read in light of remedial housing policy); Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–789 (1994) (quiet enjoyment provisions part of extensive tenant-protective scheme).

32. Defendant, by initiating, directing, and permitting prolonged and highly disruptive Renovation Work in the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises, and by failing to implement reasonable measures to mitigate the associated noise, dust, and disruption, has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

33. The Renovation Work, as carried out under Defendant’s control and for Defendant’s benefit, has caused substantial, continuous, and unreasonable disturbances, including but not limited to loud construction noise and dust infiltration, that have significantly impaired Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises as her residence and place of work during most normal daytime hours.

34. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is not excused by the fact that the work was conducted during typical business hours or that some level of noise is normally associated with building maintenance; the degree, duration, and intensity of the disturbance, and its foreseeably severe impact on Plaintiff’s daily life and work, exceed what is reasonably consistent with quiet enjoyment. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718 (landlord liable where he created conditions leading to interference despite absence of malicious intent).

35. Defendant was on notice of the impact of the Renovation Work on Plaintiff’s use of the Premises and nevertheless allowed the disruptive conditions to continue without adequate mitigation or meaningful compensation, thereby ratifying and continuing the interference. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284–286.

36. The minimal, one-time rent reduction offered by Defendant does not cure or negate the ongoing statutory violation or Plaintiff’s right to damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

37. Defendant’s actions and omissions have resulted in a substantial and material deprivation of the benefits of Plaintiff’s Tenancy, including the ability to use her home as a quiet and habitable living and working space, and therefore constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–106; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 716–718.

38. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. See also Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 760–761 (1979) (discussing remedial nature of § 14); Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 788–789.

39. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $2,200. Three months’ rent is $6,600. Plaintiff presently seeks actual damages of at least $2,000 consistent with the diminution in the value of her Tenancy and loss of use and enjoyment, and reserves all rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including the right to seek statutory damages equal to or greater than three months’ rent as may be appropriate upon further development of the case.

40. The breach of quiet enjoyment described herein is independent of, and in addition to, any rights Plaintiff may have under related housing and consumer protection statutes designed to ensure safe and decent housing and to prevent unfair or deceptive practices by landlords, including but not limited to G.L. c. 239, § 8A (permitting tenants to assert counterclaims and defenses based on interference with quiet enjoyment) and G.L. c. 93A (unfair and deceptive acts in trade or commerce). See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 201–204 (1979); Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151, 158–163 (1985).

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including, but not limited to, diminished rental value, loss of use and enjoyment of her home, disruption to her work, inconvenience, and emotional distress associated with prolonged and intrusive construction noise and dust. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–106 (recognizing damages, including emotional distress, stemming from breach of quiet enjoyment).
