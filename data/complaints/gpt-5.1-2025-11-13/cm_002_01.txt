Samantha Reed,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

Kyle Turner,  
 Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Reed (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Samantha Reed, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emily Turner.

2. The Defendant, Kyle Turner (“Father”), is an individual who currently resides, or intends imminently to reside, in the State of New Hampshire.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Emily Turner, born on __________, 2017, currently age eight (8) years old.

4. On April 15, 2021, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court entered a judgment and/or order (the “2021 Custody Order”) addressing legal custody, physical custody, parenting time, and related matters concerning the minor child.

5. Under the 2021 Custody Order, Mother has primary physical custody of Emily, and Father has parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend, pursuant to a schedule entered when both parents resided in or near Cambridge, Massachusetts, and when the child attended a local school in that area.

6. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions, including G.L. c. 209B, because Massachusetts remains the child’s home state and the original custody determination was made by this Court.

7. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6, and applicable Massachusetts domestic relations statutes.

### II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. At the time the 2021 Custody Order was entered, both Mother and Father resided in the Cambridge area, in relatively close proximity to each other and to Emily’s school and activities.

9. The parenting schedule, including Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight, was premised on the assumption that both parents would continue to live in close geographic proximity to Emily’s school, such that transitions would be short and minimally disruptive to the child’s daily routine, sleep, schooling, and activities.

10. Father has now obtained or is seeking a new job opportunity in New Hampshire and intends to relocate his residence to New Hampshire, significantly farther from Cambridge and from Emily’s school.

11. The anticipated or actual travel time between Mother’s residence in the Cambridge area and Father’s residence in New Hampshire is approximately ninety (90) minutes each way in typical traffic.

12. Under the current schedule, Father has a Wednesday overnight midweek parenting time, requiring the child to travel to Father’s home midweek and then return early the next morning for school.

13. If the current schedule remains in place after Father’s relocation to New Hampshire, Emily would be required to endure lengthy midweek drives of approximately ninety (90) minutes each way, followed by very early departures the next morning to return to school.

14. These extended midweek commute times would shorten Emily’s sleep, disrupt her school nights, interfere with her ability to complete homework, and limit her participation in after-school and extracurricular activities based near Mother’s residence and Emily’s school.

15. Emily has already begun experiencing anxiety and stress in connection with these long drives and the prospect of missing after‑school activities and routines that are important to her stability and well‑being.

16. The relocation of Father to New Hampshire, with its substantial increase in travel distance and time, was not anticipated by the parties or the Court at the time of the 2021 Custody Order.

17. The substantial change in travel distance and time, combined with Emily’s increasing age, her established school schedule, and her involvement in after‑school activities, renders the current midweek overnight schedule impracticable and contrary to Emily’s best interests.

18. The combination of Father’s relocation, the logistical burdens of midweek travel, and the adverse impact on Emily’s school, sleep, and emotional well‑being constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2021 Custody Order.

19. Mother is not seeking to interfere with or eliminate Father’s relationship with Emily, but instead seeks to modify the parenting schedule so that Father’s parenting time is exercised in a manner that is developmentally appropriate, safe, and consistent with Emily’s best interests given the new geographic realities.

20. Mother seeks removal of the midweek overnight visit and a restructuring of weekend parenting time to maintain a meaningful and substantial relationship between Father and Emily while avoiding excessive travel and disruption to Emily’s schoolweek.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

21. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting time order may be modified when the moving party demonstrates (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment or order, and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

22. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that a change in the circumstances of the parties or the child that affects the child’s welfare may warrant modification. See, e.g.:

   a. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (relocation and changed circumstances can justify modification where in child’s best interests);

   b. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (relocation and changed logistics affecting child’s stability and schooling are relevant to best interests);

   c. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (best interests of the child is the “touchstone” in custody and parenting time determinations);

   d. *Macaulay v. Macaulay*, 458 Mass. 987 (2011) (rescript) (material change and best interests required for modification);

   e. *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (material and substantial change may arise from changes in parents’ and child’s circumstances over time);

   f. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (court must consider child’s age, school, and schedule when structuring parenting time);

   g. *Williams v. Pitney*, 409 Mass. 449 (1991) (material change exists where prior order no longer serves child’s best interests);

   h. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (child’s stability, continuity, and routine are important components of best interests);

   i. *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (primary consideration is the best interests of the child, including emotional and developmental needs);

   j. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (appellate courts defer to trial court’s modification decisions focused on child’s welfare and practical realities).

23. G.L. c. 208, § 28 expressly authorizes the Court to “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment” as to custody and visitation “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

24. Likewise, G.L. c. 209C, § 20 provides that the Court may modify any order for custody or parenting time “as the circumstances of the parties and the best interests of the child require.”

25. In determining a child’s best interests, the Court must evaluate, among other things, the child’s age and developmental needs, the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community, the desirability of maintaining continuity in the child’s environment, and the ability of each parent to provide for the child’s emotional, educational, and physical needs. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96; see also G.L. c. 208, § 31.

26. Massachusetts courts recognize that significant changes in geographic distance and logistics affecting a child’s school schedule and daily routines may constitute a material change warranting reconsideration of parenting time arrangements. See *Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 710–11; *Rosenthal*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262–64; *Murray*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 151–52.

27. The law also acknowledges that as a child matures, her needs for stable school attendance, rest, and community involvement may require adjustment of prior parenting schedules that were suitable when she was younger or when family circumstances were different. See *Murray*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 150–52; *Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. at 244–46.

### IV. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

28. At the time of the 2021 Custody Order, both parents lived in close proximity to Emily’s school; the midweek overnight was reasonable and minimally disruptive in that context.

29. Father’s relocation to New Hampshire—creating a commute of approximately ninety (90) minutes each way—constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not reasonably contemplated when the 2021 Custody Order was entered.

30. The long midweek commute that would result if the Wednesday overnight remains in place would significantly disrupt Emily’s sleep, school attendance, homework, and participation in after‑school activities, and has already caused her anxiety and distress.

31. Requiring an eight‑year‑old child to endure lengthy car rides on school nights and very early morning departures for school is inconsistent with the emphasis Massachusetts law places on stability, continuity, and protection of the child’s emotional and educational welfare. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43; *Mason*, 447 Mass. at 183–84.

32. The existing Wednesday overnight schedule, while previously workable, is no longer suitable given Father’s relocation and Emily’s increasing educational and extracurricular commitments. The continuation of the same schedule is now contrary to Emily’s best interests.

33. Adjusting the parenting schedule to remove the midweek overnight and to provide for parenting time primarily on weekends, or otherwise at times that do not intrude on Emily’s schoolweek, will better serve her best interests while still preserving a meaningful relationship with Father.

34. A modified schedule that takes into account travel time and Emily’s school and activity schedule is consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and with the best‑interests framework articulated in *Mason*, *Custody of Kali*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Yannas*, *Rosenthal*, and related cases.

35. Mother’s requested modification does not seek to terminate or unreasonably limit Father’s relationship with Emily, but rather to allocate parenting time in a manner that is logistically feasible, safe, and developmentally appropriate, consistent with the child’s emotional and educational needs.

36. It is therefore in Emily’s best interests that the current 2021 Custody Order be modified to remove the midweek overnight, to adjust the weekend schedule to reflect the increased travel distance, and to clarify that midweek contact, if any, shall be limited to virtual or non‑overnight contact that does not disrupt school.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Samantha Reed, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the April 15, 2021 Custody Order, including but not limited to Father’s relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting increased travel distance and time for the minor child.

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting time provisions is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Turner, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and applicable case law.

C. Modify the 2021 Custody Order to provide that:

   1. Mother, Samantha Reed, shall continue to have primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Turner, with legal custody as previously ordered unless otherwise modified by this Court.

   2. Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time shall be removed. In lieu thereof, if appropriate and feasible, Father may have a non‑overnight midweek dinner visit or virtual/video contact at a time that does not interfere with Emily’s school attendance, sleep, homework, and after‑school activities, as the parties may agree or the Court may order.

   3. Father’s weekend parenting time shall be adjusted to minimize excessive travel and to promote stability for Emily, such as:

      a. Alternating weekend parenting time from Friday after school (or at a time minimally disruptive to Emily’s routine) until Sunday at a reasonable return time; or

      b. Such other weekend or school‑vacation schedule as the Court finds to be in Emily’s best interests in light of Father’s New Hampshire residence and the approximately ninety (90) minute travel distance.

   4. The parties shall confer in good faith regarding holiday, school vacation, and summer schedules that may allow Father to exercise longer but less frequent periods of parenting time, so as to reduce the frequency of long‑distance trips during the schoolweek, subject to further order of the Court as needed.

D. Enter any additional or clarifying provisions concerning transportation responsibilities, pick‑up and drop‑off locations and times, communication between the parties, and methods of contact between Father and Emily, as the Court deems necessary to implement the modified parenting schedule efficiently and in Emily’s best interests.

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

Plaintiff,  
Samantha Reed,  
pro se
