COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; c. 209C, § 20; and related authority)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother and primary residential parent of the minor child, Ethan Thompson, age 8.

2. The Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Defendant” or “Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.

3. The minor child who is the subject of this Complaint is:

   - Ethan Thompson, age 8 (date of birth intentionally omitted for privacy), currently residing primarily with the Plaintiff in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time in this matter pursuant to the prior custody and parenting order issued by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court on September 15, 2021 (the “Existing Order”).

5. Jurisdiction is proper under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (as applied to custody and visitation modifications) and M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as well as the Court’s inherent and continuing jurisdiction over matters involving the custody, care, and best interests of minor children.

6. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior order was issued by this Court and the minor child resides within Bristol County. See M.G.L. c. 215, § 3; M.G.L. c. 208, § 6.

### III. PRIOR ORDER

7. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment/Order providing, in substance, that:

   a. The parties would share joint legal custody of Ethan; and  

   b. Ethan’s primary residence would be with the Plaintiff; and  

   c. The Defendant would exercise parenting time with Ethan on designated weekends and as otherwise specified in the Existing Order (the “Parenting Schedule”).

8. At the time the Existing Order was entered, the Court found, expressly or implicitly, that both parties were sufficiently stable and able to co‑parent and that the then‑existing parenting arrangement would serve Ethan’s best interests.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

9. Under Massachusetts law, a custody and parenting time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment or order, and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–187 (2006); *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 682–83 (2016).

10. The “paramount concern” in all custody and parenting matters is the best interests and welfare of the child. *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003); M.G.L. c. 208, § 31.

11. The Court may modify custody and parenting time orders when changed conditions affect the child’s welfare or safety, including changes concerning a parent’s stability, substance use, or ability to provide appropriate care during parenting time. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85; *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226, 239–40 (2012); *Champion v. Champion*, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 221–22 (2002).

12. When facts suggest impairment or risk to a child in a parent’s household, the Court has authority to adjust or condition parenting time, including imposing supervision or restrictions, to protect the child while preserving the parent‑child relationship when reasonably possible. See *Care & Protection of Emily*, 433 Mass. 354, 362–63 (2001); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); *Williams v. Pitney*, 409 Mass. 449, 453–54 (1991).

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

13. Since the entry of the Existing Order on September 15, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances concerning the Defendant’s behavior during his parenting time with Ethan, specifically relating to suspected alcohol or substance use and its impact on the child’s safety and well‑being.

14. Over the last several months, Ethan has spontaneously reported to the Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at the Defendant’s residence when he is there.

15. Ethan has further described to the Plaintiff that, at times during his visits, the Defendant “can’t walk straight,” thereby suggesting that the Defendant may be intoxicated or otherwise impaired while responsible for Ethan’s care.

16. A neighbor, who is familiar with the parties’ situation and knows that the Defendant has parenting time with Ethan, recently sent the Plaintiff a video depicting the Defendant stumbling while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night.

17. In the video, the Defendant appears unsteady, physically off‑balance, and unable to walk with normal coordination as he assists Ethan out of the car, raising significant concerns that the Defendant may have been driving or caring for Ethan while under the influence of alcohol or another substance.

18. The Plaintiff is prepared to produce the video, and any related communications with the neighbor, as evidence in these proceedings, and requests that the Court consider such evidence in assessing the material change in circumstances and any risk to Ethan.

19. Ethan’s school has notified the Plaintiff that Ethan frequently appears exhausted, particularly on Monday mornings following weekend visits with the Defendant.

20. Teachers and/or school staff have indicated to the Plaintiff that Ethan’s tiredness on Mondays has become a pattern that interferes with his classroom attention, participation, and academic performance.

21. Ethan has told the Plaintiff that he sometimes goes to bed “very late” at the Defendant’s home, further suggesting a lack of consistent structure or appropriate nighttime supervision during Defendant’s parenting time.

22. These concerns—Ethan’s reported observations of “special drinks,” his description of the Defendant’s impaired gait, the neighbor’s video of the Defendant stumbling while caring for Ethan late at night, and the school’s observations of Ethan’s exhaustion—were not present and could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time the Existing Order was entered in September 2021.

23. The Existing Order was based, in part, on the assumption that both parents were stable and would not expose Ethan to impairment or unsafe conditions while exercising custody or parenting time.

24. The Defendant’s apparent impairment, combined with late‑night activities and lack of adequate rest for Ethan, constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances directly affecting Ethan’s safety, welfare, and best interests.

25. The Plaintiff is genuinely and reasonably concerned that Ethan may be at risk of harm if the Defendant continues to exercise unsupervised overnight parenting time while impaired or otherwise unable to provide appropriate care and supervision.

26. The Plaintiff’s concerns are not speculative or based on mere disagreement with the Defendant’s parenting style; rather, they are grounded in specific, recent observations, statements from Ethan, corroboration via a neighbor’s video, and consistent reports from Ethan’s school.

27. Given these developments, the continuation of the current Parenting Schedule, particularly unsupervised overnight visits, no longer serves Ethan’s best interests and may place him at risk of physical and emotional harm.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

28. In determining custody and parenting time, the Court must consider “the happiness and welfare of the child,” and the child’s safety and stability are paramount. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43.

29. The pattern of possible alcohol or substance impairment by the Defendant during his parenting time is directly relevant to Ethan’s physical safety (including potential impaired driving and supervision) and emotional security.

30. The Court has discretion to modify parenting time and impose conditions such as supervision, restrictions on alcohol or substance use, requirements for sobriety monitoring, and limitations on overnights where necessary to safeguard a child’s welfare. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85; *Care & Protection of Emily*, 433 Mass. at 362–63; *Rosen v. Rosen*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 682–83.

31. Massachusetts appellate courts have recognized that a child’s exposure to a parent’s substance misuse or instability may warrant modification of custody or parenting arrangements when such exposure jeopardizes the child’s welfare or undermines the stability and predictability essential for healthy development. See, e.g., *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 239–40; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–44; *Champion v. Champion*, 54 Mass. App. Ct. at 221–22.

32. Ethan is eight years old, in elementary school, and in a developmental stage requiring consistent structure, adequate sleep, and reliable supervision in order to succeed academically and emotionally.

33. Ethan’s repeated Monday exhaustion following weekend time with the Defendant strongly suggests that his basic needs for rest and routine are not being adequately met during those visits, contrary to his best interests.

34. While maintaining a meaningful relationship with both parents is generally in a child’s best interests, such contact must be structured in a way that does not compromise the child’s safety, stability, or emotional well‑being. See *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. at 239–40; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

35. Reasonable conditions on the Defendant’s parenting time—such as supervision of overnights or restrictions concerning alcohol and substance use during parenting time—can protect Ethan while preserving his relationship with the Defendant.

36. Under the totality of the circumstances, the requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the specific safety and welfare concerns that have arisen since the Existing Order, and is necessary to protect Ethan’s best interests.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

37. The Plaintiff does not seek to terminate the Defendant’s relationship with Ethan, but rather to modify the Existing Order to ensure that Ethan’s safety and well‑being are adequately protected.

38. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court find:

   a. That there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order on September 15, 2021, relating to the Defendant’s apparent impairment and its impact on Ethan’s welfare; and  

   b. That modification of the Existing Order is in Ethan’s best interests.

39. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that the Court:

   a. Maintain primary physical custody of Ethan with the Plaintiff;  

   b. Maintain joint legal custody only to the extent that the Court finds the parties are able to effectively communicate and make major decisions together in Ethan’s best interests, and, if not, grant sole legal custody to the Plaintiff;  

   c. Modify the Defendant’s parenting time such that:  

      i. All overnight parenting time by the Defendant with Ethan shall be supervised by an agreed‑upon, responsible adult approved by the Court, or by a professional supervised parenting provider, until further order of the Court; or, in the alternative,  

      ii. Overnight parenting time shall be temporarily suspended, and the Defendant’s parenting time shall be limited to daytime visits on a schedule determined by the Court (for example, certain daytime hours on weekends), pending further review;  

   d. Order that the Defendant shall not consume or be under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or any impairing substance during parenting time, and that he shall not drive with Ethan in the vehicle if he has consumed alcohol or any impairing substance within a reasonable period prior to or during parenting time;  

   e. Permit the Plaintiff to request, and the Court to order, appropriate alcohol or substance use monitoring and/or evaluation for the Defendant (including, but not limited to, random testing or participation in an approved program) if the Court deems it necessary to protect Ethan’s safety;  

   f. Order that the Defendant shall ensure that Ethan has an age‑appropriate bedtime and sufficient rest during all periods of parenting time, so that he can attend school rested and ready to learn;  

   g. Provide that either party may move for a review of these conditions upon a showing of further changed circumstances, including significant documented sobriety, treatment compliance, or other relevant factors; and  

   h. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

40. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court schedule this matter for a prompt case management conference and, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing, in order to address the safety issues raised herein without undue delay.

41. The Plaintiff also requests that the Court, in its discretion, consider appointing a Guardian ad Litem and/or ordering any other appropriate investigation or evaluation focused on Ethan’s best interests, the parties’ parenting capacities, and the impact of any substance use on Ethan’s safety and well‑being.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the September 15, 2021 custody and parenting order, particularly concerning the Defendant’s apparent impairment during parenting time and its impact on Ethan’s safety and welfare;

B. Find that modification of custody and/or parenting time is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Thompson;

C. Modify the Existing Order to:

   1. Confirm that Ethan’s primary physical residence is with the Plaintiff;  

   2. Maintain, or if warranted, award sole legal custody to the Plaintiff;  

   3. Impose conditions on the Defendant’s parenting time, including supervised overnights or, alternatively, suspension of overnights with daytime parenting time only, and such additional safeguards regarding alcohol or substance use as the Court deems necessary;  

D. Enter a temporary order, if appropriate, providing interim protections for Ethan pending final hearing on this Complaint for Modification;

E. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
Jessica Martinez,
