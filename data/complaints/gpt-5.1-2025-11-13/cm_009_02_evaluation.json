The court affirms dismissal of the mother\u2019s complaint for modification seeking removal, applying the Yannas \u2018real advantage/best interests\u2019 test under G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 30. Nowhere does the court articulate a general rule that when post\u2011judgment circumstances significantly change and the existing order is no longer consistent with the child\u2019s best interests, the Probate and Family Court may and should modify the order; nor does it modify custody or visitation on that basis. The case therefore does not support the broad proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe mother, Dawn Michelle Murray, appeals from a judgment of the Probate and Family Court dismissing her complaint for modification, which sought to remove the minor children of the marriage to the State of California. Where the parent seeking to move has primary physical custody of the children, the standard governing removal of the minor children from the Commonwealth requires a determination whether there is a real advantage to the custodial parent and consideration of the best interests of the children and the interests of both parents.\u201d"

The case instead discusses best\u2011interests analysis in an original custody determination, so it does not provide authority for the proposition about modifying orders based on post\u2011judgment changes in a child\u2019s circumstances.",
