ALEX RIVERA,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                   Civil Action No. ___________

JORDAN MORGAN,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Alex Rivera (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows against Defendant Jordan Morgan (“Defendant”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Alex Rivera is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is a residential tenant of the premises located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Jordan Morgan is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner, lessor, and/or person or entity in control of the Premises at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted as Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, including § 14.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A, and 21, and G.L. c. 185C, because the action arises out of a residential tenancy and the damages sought are within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Jamaica Plain Division, because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction, and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in this Division. See G.L. c. 223, § 2; G.L. c. 218, § 2.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a studio apartment at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

7. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent in the amount of $1,500 to Defendant for the Premises.

8. During the showing of the unit, prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the Premises.

9. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the water stains and was told by Defendant that they were the result of an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”

10. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant’s representations that the leak had been repaired and that the water intrusion problem had been resolved in deciding to rent the Premises.

11. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, during the first significant rainstorm, water began dripping through the ceiling in the same area where Plaintiff had previously observed the stains.

12. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant that water was leaking through the ceiling.

13. Since that time, Plaintiff has complained to Defendant multiple times about the leaking ceiling and related conditions, including during and after subsequent rainstorms.

14. Rather than making meaningful repairs, Defendant repeatedly minimized the problem, referring to it as a “minor cosmetic issue” and stating that Plaintiff knew the apartment had “character” when Plaintiff signed the lease.

15. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant failed and refused to adequately repair the roof, ceiling, and related building systems to stop the water leakage.

16. During later rainstorms, the leaking grew progressively worse, resulting in substantial water intrusion into the living area of the Premises.

17. On at least one occasion, water from the leaking ceiling soaked Plaintiff’s couch and a laptop computer that had been left on Plaintiff’s coffee table.

18. The laptop was damaged beyond repair, and Plaintiff was forced to replace it at a cost of approximately $900.

19. The ongoing moisture has created a persistent musty odor in the Premises, consistent with dampness and possible mold growth.

20. After the leak continued and the musty smell developed, Plaintiff began experiencing frequent headaches that Plaintiff reasonably believes are related to the damp and moldy conditions.

21. As a result of the water intrusion and dampness, Plaintiff has had to move Plaintiff’s bed and other furniture away from the affected ceiling area.

22. Plaintiff has effectively been forced to live in only a portion of the studio, significantly limiting Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

23. The conditions at the Premises, including but not limited to repeated water leaks, saturated furniture and personal property, musty odors, and suspected mold, render the apartment unhealthy and unsafe, and substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

24. Defendant has been made aware of these conditions through Plaintiff’s multiple oral complaints.

25. Despite this actual knowledge, Defendant has failed to remedy the conditions in a timely and effective manner.

26. Defendant’s failure to repair the leak and related conditions occurred while Plaintiff was paying, or was ready, willing, and able to pay, the monthly rent of $1,500.

27. Plaintiff has at all relevant times complied with Plaintiff’s material obligations under the tenancy, other than any nonpayment or withholding of rent that may have been justified under applicable law due to the substandard conditions.

28. Defendant’s failure and refusal to correct the leak and related hazardous and unhealthy conditions is contrary to Defendant’s duties as a residential landlord under Massachusetts law, including Defendant’s duty not to interfere with Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including, but not limited to:

   a. Loss and damage to personal property, including a laptop computer costing approximately $900 to replace;  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, including effectively being restricted to living in only a portion of the studio apartment;  
   c. Physical discomfort and symptoms, including recurrent headaches reasonably associated with the damp and moldy conditions; and  
   d. Emotional distress, annoyance, inconvenience, and loss of peace of mind due to the ongoing, unresolved water intrusion and unhealthy conditions.

30. Plaintiff estimates actual out-of-pocket damages in the amount of at least $900, exclusive of any statutory multiple damages, attorney’s fees, costs, and interest.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

31. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rental premises.

33. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that where a landlord “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises,” the landlord “shall . . . be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

34. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, is bound by the covenant of quiet enjoyment imposed by G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as the common law implied covenant recognized in cases such as Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), and Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to freedom from serious interference with the tenancy, including conditions that make the premises unfit for human habitation or substantially interfere with their use. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

36. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises so as to comply with the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994).

37. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code requires, among other things, that dwellings be kept in good repair and in a condition fit for human habitation, free from chronic dampness and water penetration. See 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.550, 410.750.

38. The repeated and ongoing water leaks through the ceiling, resulting in wet and damaged furniture, dampness, musty odors, and suspected mold, constitute serious Sanitary Code violations and conditions materially impairing the health, safety, and well-being of occupants.

39. Defendant knew or should have known about the persistent water intrusion, both because of the pre‑existing ceiling stains observed by Plaintiff and because of Plaintiff’s repeated complaints after the tenancy began.

40. Defendant’s failure to remedy the roof and ceiling leaks, and the conditions that followed, constitutes at minimum negligent, and in the circumstances reckless or willful, disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and of the habitability and safety of the Premises.

41. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s failure to correct serious defective conditions after notice can amount to a constructive eviction or breach of quiet enjoyment. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708 (2002).

42. In Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), the Supreme Judicial Court held that prolonged water seepage and flooding, causing dampness, odors, and the presence of mold and mildew, constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and supported an award of damages, including for emotional distress.

43. Defendant’s conduct here—allowing recurring roof and ceiling leaks to persist, resulting in damp, musty, and unhealthy conditions and substantial loss of use of the Premises—directly parallels the type of interference with tenancy found actionable in Simon v. Solomon and related cases.

44. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to identify and correct the leak, despite notice and an opportunity to do so, is an “indirect” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

45. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been substantial, continuous, and material, not trivial or de minimis, and has significantly deprived Plaintiff of the full use and comfort of the Premises.

46. Defendant’s conduct also violates the public policy of the Commonwealth that residential premises comply with the implied warranty of habitability. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979). While the present claim is brought only for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the same underlying facts demonstrate the uninhabitable nature of the conditions.

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including, but not limited to:

   a. Damage to personal property, including the destroyed laptop (approximately $900) and water‑soaked furniture;  
   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a significant portion of the Premises over an extended period;  
   c. Physical discomfort and health symptoms, including headaches; and  
   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of peace of mind.

48. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs of the action and a reasonable attorney’s fee.

49. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500; three months’ rent therefore equals $4,500.

50. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to damaged personal property, loss of use and enjoyment, and consequential harms, are reasonably expected to equal or exceed three months’ rent.

51. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount of no less than three months’ rent ($4,500), or the full amount of Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, together with costs and such attorney’s fees as may be awarded if Plaintiff later retains counsel.

52. Interest on any judgment in Plaintiff’s favor is recoverable pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B.


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Alex Rivera respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against Defendant Jordan Morgan and award the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount equal to the greater of:

   1. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to the cost of the destroyed laptop (approximately $900), damage to furniture and other personal property, and compensation for loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; or  
   2. Three months’ rent, i.e., at least $4,500;

C. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law, including G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

D. An award of costs of this action as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E. A reasonable attorney’s fee under G.L. c. 186, § 14 if and to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel who appears in this action; and

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.


### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
