JORDAN THOMPSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                          
                                             Civil Action No. __________  
MARK W. WILLIAMS,

----------------------------------------  

### COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Jordan Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for a Complaint against Defendant Mark W. Williams (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mark W. Williams is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was operating a motor vehicle in the City of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was the operator and/or custodian of a motor vehicle being used as a rideshare vehicle in the course of transporting passengers for compensation.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of a motor vehicle–bicycle collision occurring on August 12, 2023, on or about 17th Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore confers jurisdiction on the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Suffolk County because the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the parties either reside or regularly conduct activity in Suffolk County. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about August 12, 2023, at approximately mid‑morning, Plaintiff was lawfully operating a bicycle in a marked bicycle lane on a public way known as or commonly referred to as 17th Street, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02116.

8. The roadway at the location of the incident includes a designated bicycle lane adjacent to a curbside loading zone customarily used for short‑term stopping by motor vehicles, including rideshare vehicles.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating her bicycle in a careful, lawful, and prudent manner, within the marked bike lane, with the flow of traffic, obeying all applicable traffic control devices, and wearing a bicycle helmet.

10. At or about the same time and place, Defendant was operating or had recently operated a motor vehicle and had parked or stopped the vehicle in a loading zone immediately adjacent to the marked bike lane on 17th Street.

11. After stopping in the loading zone, Defendant, without first exercising reasonable care to ensure that opening his vehicle door would not endanger or impede the travel of bicyclists or other traffic, suddenly and forcefully opened his driver‑side door directly into the marked bike lane and into the immediate path of Plaintiff’s oncoming bicycle.

12. Defendant opened the door without checking his side or rearview mirrors, without turning to observe oncoming bicycles or vehicles, and without taking any other reasonable precaution to determine whether it was safe to open the door into the lane of travel.

13. At the moment Defendant swung his door open, Plaintiff was riding lawfully and predictably within the boundaries of the bike lane, adjacent to Defendant’s parked vehicle.

14. Defendant’s door opened so abruptly and so close in time and space to Plaintiff’s position that Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to stop, slow, or swerve so as to avoid a collision, despite exercising due care.

15. Plaintiff’s bicycle struck the edge of the suddenly opened door (“dooring” incident), causing Plaintiff to be thrown from the bicycle and to land violently upon the pavement.

16. As a direct and immediate result of the collision and fall, Plaintiff suffered road rash and abrasions on both arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and additional pain and physical trauma associated with the impact.

17. At the scene of the incident, Defendant admitted to Plaintiff that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he had been checking his phone immediately prior to opening the door.

18. Defendant’s statement, made contemporaneously with the incident, is an admission against interest and demonstrates that Defendant diverted his attention from his surroundings and from the condition of the roadway and bike lane in violation of his duty of reasonable care to other users of the road, including bicyclists.

19. After the incident, Plaintiff promptly sought necessary medical and dental treatment for her injuries, including treatment and repair of the chipped front tooth and care for the abrasions and road rash on her arms and legs.

20. Plaintiff incurred approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) in medical and dental expenses reasonably necessary to treat the injuries caused by the incident.

21. As a further direct result of the incident and the injuries sustained, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time, and thereby incurred approximately Eight Hundred Dollars ($800) in lost wages.

22. Plaintiff’s bicycle frame was bent and rendered unsafe or uneconomical to repair, requiring Plaintiff to replace the bicycle at her own expense.

23. In addition to economic losses, Plaintiff experienced significant pain, suffering, inconvenience, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment of life in the days and weeks following the incident, and continues to experience pain, discomfort, and emotional distress related to the collision and its aftermath.

24. Plaintiff submitted a bodily injury and property damage claim to Defendant’s automobile insurer, providing information consistent with the facts alleged herein.

25. Plaintiff is informed and believes that Defendant subsequently told his insurer that Plaintiff had been “weaving in and out of traffic,” a statement that contradicts his admission at the scene and that is false; Plaintiff was at all relevant times riding in a straight trajectory, within the marked bike lane, and in accordance with applicable traffic rules.

26. Plaintiff did not weave into traffic, did not leave the bike lane, and did not otherwise act in any way that was unsafe, erratic, or in violation of traffic laws.

27. At all times relevant, Plaintiff acted with reasonable care and in a manner consistent with that of a reasonably prudent bicyclist using a designated bicycle lane in an urban environment.

28. Defendant’s actions and omissions on August 12, 2023 were the direct and proximate cause of the collision, of Plaintiff’s bodily injuries, and of Plaintiff’s economic and non‑economic damages.

---

## IV. NEGLIGENCE (AGAINST DEFENDANT MARK W. WILLIAMS)

29. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 28 as though fully set forth herein.

### Duty

30. Under Massachusetts law, every operator and occupant of a motor vehicle owes a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others using the public ways, including bicyclists and pedestrians. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (general duty of reasonable care); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (motorist’s duty to exercise reasonable care toward others on the way).

31. Defendant, as the operator and person in control of the subject motor vehicle, owed Plaintiff a duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would act under like circumstances, including but not limited to:

   a. A duty to maintain a proper lookout for bicyclists traveling in the adjacent marked bike lane;

   b. A duty to refrain from opening the vehicle door into the lane of travel without first ascertaining that such movement could be made with safety;

   c. A duty to comply with applicable statutes and regulations governing the opening of vehicle doors and interactions with bicyclists on Massachusetts roadways; and

   d. A duty to refrain from distracted behavior, including use of handheld electronic devices, that would impair his ability to observe and respond to foreseeable hazards.

32. Massachusetts law specifically prohibits opening “the door of a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so without interfering with the movement of other traffic, including bicyclists.” See G.L. c. 90, § 14 (as amended; statute requiring safe operation around bicyclists and prohibiting unsafe opening of doors into traffic).

33. Bicycles are recognized as lawful vehicles on Massachusetts roadways and bicycle lanes, and bicyclists are entitled to the protections of the rules of the road. See G.L. c. 85, § 11B (rights and duties of bicyclists); G.L. c. 89, § 1 (rules for vehicles using public ways).

34. Violation of a safety statute enacted for the protection of the class of persons of which Plaintiff is a member (bicyclists using public ways) is evidence of negligence. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990) (statutory violations as evidence of negligence); Perry v. Medeiros, 369 Mass. 836, 841 (1976) (same).

### Breach

35. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Abruptly and forcefully opening the driver‑side door of his vehicle into a marked bicycle lane without first checking his mirrors, looking over his shoulder, or otherwise ensuring the maneuver could be done safely;

   b. Failing to maintain a proper and reasonable lookout for bicyclists lawfully traveling in the adjacent bike lane;

   c. Failing to yield or otherwise give right of way to a bicyclist occupying the bike lane before opening his door into that lane;

   d. Operating as a rideshare driver and stopping in a location and in a manner that created a foreseeable hazard to bicyclists;

   e. Using or checking his phone immediately prior to opening the vehicle door, thereby distracting himself from his surroundings and violating his duty to maintain attention to road and lane conditions;

   f. Violating G.L. c. 90, § 14 by opening the door of a motor vehicle into the path of oncoming traffic, including bicyclists, when it was not reasonably safe to do so and when the movement interfered with the movement of other traffic; and

   g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

36. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that 17th Street in Boston is a busy urban street with regular bicycle traffic, and that a marked bike lane adjacent to a loading zone is commonly used by commuters such as Plaintiff.

37. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that opening a vehicle door without checking for oncoming bicyclists in a marked bike lane could cause a collision, resulting in serious bodily injury and property damage to a bicyclist.

38. Defendant’s admitted failure to see Plaintiff because he was checking his phone demonstrates a conscious disregard of the obvious risk that distracted conduct posed to vulnerable road users, including bicyclists.

39. Under Massachusetts law, a motorist or vehicle occupant who opens a car door into oncoming traffic without taking reasonable precautions is negligent. See, e.g., G.L. c. 90, § 14; compare Barry v. Beverly Enterprises–Massachusetts, Inc., 418 Mass. 590, 593–94 (1994) (defendant must act as reasonable person to prevent foreseeable harm); Jorgensen v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying Massachusetts negligence standards).

### Causation

40. Defendant’s negligent conduct was the direct and proximate cause of the collision and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431 (adopted in substance in multiple Massachusetts decisions, including Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002)).

41. But for Defendant’s negligent act of opening the vehicle door into the marked bike lane, without checking for traffic and while distracted by his phone, Plaintiff would not have struck the door, would not have been thrown from the bicycle, and would not have sustained the injuries and losses described herein.

42. No act or omission by Plaintiff was the cause in fact or legal cause of the collision. Plaintiff was acting reasonably, predictably, and in compliance with applicable traffic laws at all relevant times.

43. Any suggestion that Plaintiff was weaving in and out of traffic, or otherwise acting negligently, is false. Even if the Court were to find that Plaintiff bore some degree of fault—which Plaintiff expressly denies—Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, would allow recovery so long as Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than that of Defendant, with damages reduced proportionally.

### Damages

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including but not limited to:

   a. Road rash and abrasions on both arms and legs;

   b. A chipped front tooth; and

   c. Related pain, suffering, and physical impairment.

45. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses in an amount presently estimated at approximately One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500), and subject to revision according to proof at trial. See G.L. c. 231, § 60F (medical bills as evidence of reasonableness of medical expenses).

46. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff lost earnings and wages in an amount presently estimated at approximately Eight Hundred Dollars ($800), and may experience future loss or diminution of earning capacity, all according to proof at trial. See O’Connor v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 401 Mass. 586, 593–94 (1988) (lost wages and earning capacity as recoverable damages).

47. Plaintiff also suffered damage to personal property, including but not limited to the bicycle involved in the collision, which sustained a bent frame and related damage such that it was rendered unsafe or not reasonably repairable, requiring replacement at Plaintiff’s expense.

48. Plaintiff has endured, and continues to endure, physical pain, discomfort, and emotional distress, including anxiety and apprehension about riding a bicycle in traffic and in bike lanes where vehicles are parked or stopped nearby.

49. Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and interference with her usual activities, recreation, and daily routines as a result of the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence. See DoCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 781–82 (1975) (pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life as compensable elements of damages).

50. Under Massachusetts law, a tortfeasor is liable for all harm that is the natural and probable consequence of his negligent acts, including aggravation of pre‑existing conditions, if any. See Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251, 254–55 (1935). To the extent Plaintiff had any pre‑existing conditions, they were aggravated by the collision, and Defendant is responsible for such aggravation.

51. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for all economic and non‑economic losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. See G.L. c. 231, § 60H; McGuiggan v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 398 Mass. 152, 162–63 (1986).

52. Plaintiff also seeks statutory interest from the date of commencement of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and taxable costs as allowed by law.
