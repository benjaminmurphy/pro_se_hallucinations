However, it does not involve or discuss hazardous property conditions, constructive or actual notice of a dangerous condition, or the idea that an employer is \"charged with knowledge\" of a condition created by an employee.

Once employment is established, the only remaining issue is whether he was working for BMA at the time of the alleged negligent treatment, i.e., whether his treatment of the plaintiff was within the scope of his employment by BMA.
