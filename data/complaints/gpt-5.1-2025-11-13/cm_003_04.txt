JENNIFER SMITH,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

DAVID JOHNSON,  
 Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, David Johnson (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, is an individual residing in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, David Johnson, upon information and belief, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child who is the subject of this Complaint.

3. The parties are the parents of the following minor child:

   - Michael Johnson, date of birth __________, age 8 (hereinafter “Michael” or “the child”).

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDERS

4. On or about May 15, 2021, the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary Order that merged into a Judgment) concerning legal custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child (the “2021 Judgment”).

5. The 2021 Judgment provides, in substance, that:

   a. The parties share joint legal custody of Michael; and  
   b. Michael’s primary residence is with Mother; and  
   c. Father has parenting time with overnights on certain weekends, as set forth in the 2021 Judgment.

6. At the time of the 2021 Judgment, the Court found that both parties were relatively stable and able to co‑parent, and that the then‑existing parenting plan was in the best interests of the child.

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (if applicable); and applicable provisions of G.L. c. 215, as the Probate and Family Court is the proper court to adjudicate matters of custody and parenting time for minor children.

8. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Probate and Family Court because the prior custody Judgment was issued by this Court and the child resides within this Court’s jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6.

9. Massachusetts is the child’s “home state” within the meaning of the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, in that the child has resided in Massachusetts with Mother for more than six (6) consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of this Complaint. See G.L. c. 209B, § 2.

### IV. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

10. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting‑time order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

11. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting‑time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

12. The Court must consider, among other factors, the child’s safety, welfare, and emotional well‑being; each parent’s ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment; and any circumstances that may place the child at risk, including exposure to substance abuse or impaired caregiving. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

13. In determining whether to modify custody and parenting time, the Court may consider events occurring since the prior judgment that show that the assumptions underlying the existing order are no longer valid. See Delmolino v. Nance, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 210–11 (1982); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736–38.

14. The Court has broad equitable authority to tailor custody and parenting‑time orders, including orders for supervised or conditional parenting time, to protect the child and advance the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 215, § 6; Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 766–67 (1983); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998).

15. Where there is credible evidence that a parent’s substance use or intoxication may impair judgment or compromise the safety of the child, the Court may impose safeguards, conditions, or supervision on that parent’s contact with the child. See Adoption of Quentin, 424 Mass. 882, 886–88 (1997); Adoption of Carlos, 413 Mass. 339, 350–52 (1992); Adoption of Elena, 446 Mass. 24, 30–31 (2006).

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

16. Since the entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting Michael’s safety, welfare, and best interests, particularly during Father’s parenting time.

17. The 2021 Judgment was entered under the assumption that both parents were stable, that there were no significant safety concerns, and that they could appropriately co‑parent and exercise unsupervised parenting time.

18. Over the past several months (and increasingly during 2025), Michael has made statements to Mother that reasonably cause Mother to fear that Father may be consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substances during, or immediately before, his parenting time with Michael.

19. Michael has reported to Mother that there are “special drinks” at Father’s home, and that Father sometimes “can’t walk straight.” These statements are unusual for an eight‑year‑old child and are consistent with observable signs of intoxication.

20. A neighbor, who is familiar with the parties’ custodial arrangements and with Michael, recently sent Mother a video recording depicting Father stumbling while removing Michael from the car late at night, appearing unsteady on his feet.

21. In the video, Father’s gait appears impaired, and he appears to have difficulty maintaining balance and properly supervising Michael as they exit the vehicle, raising grave concerns about Father’s sobriety and his ability to provide safe care, particularly late at night and during overnights.

22. Michael’s school has reported to Mother that Michael often appears unusually exhausted and tired on Monday mornings following weekends spent with Father, suggesting that his sleep and routine may be disrupted during Father’s parenting time.

23. Mother is informed and believes that Father may be consuming alcohol and/or other substances to a degree that impairs his parenting capacity during his custodial time and during transportation of the child, thereby placing Michael at risk.

24. The combination of Michael’s statements, the neighbor’s video, and the school’s observations is a significant change from the circumstances that existed in May 2021, when there were no such concerns reported to the Court.

25. These developments undermine the assumption of stability and safe, unimpaired caregiving that formed the basis of the 2021 Judgment and constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting judicial review and modification. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736–38; Delmolino v. Nance, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 210–11.

26. Mother is genuinely and reasonably concerned about Michael’s physical safety, emotional well‑being, and sleep/rest while in Father’s care during overnights, particularly when Father may be under the influence of alcohol or other substances.

27. Mother’s concerns are not based on a desire to interfere with Father’s relationship with Michael, but on her obligation to protect Michael and to ensure that any parenting‑time schedule adequately safeguards his health and safety. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

28. As a result of these changed circumstances, continuation of the current schedule of unsupervised overnights with Father, without conditions or safeguards, is no longer in Michael’s best interests and may expose him to unnecessary risk.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

29. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, and controlling case law, Michael’s best interests must guide the Court’s determination of custody and parenting time. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

30. Michael is a young child, age 8, who depends upon each parent to provide a safe, sober, and stable environment, especially during evenings and overnight periods.

31. Exposure to an impaired caregiver—particularly where the caregiver is responsible for nighttime supervision and transportation—poses significant risks, including but not limited to inadequate supervision, unsafe transportation, accidental injury, and emotional distress. See Adoption of Quentin, 424 Mass. at 886–88; Adoption of Carlos, 413 Mass. at 350–52.

32. A child who is consistently overtired or exhausted following visits may also experience impaired school performance, difficulty concentrating, and emotional or behavioral consequences, all contrary to his best interests and welfare.

33. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to protect Michael by placing reasonable conditions and/or supervision on Father’s overnights, rather than severing the father‑child relationship.

34. Supervised or otherwise conditional parenting time is an accepted and lawful mechanism for balancing a child’s need for a relationship with a parent with the need for safety and stability. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. at 191; Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. at 766–67.

35. A modification that limits or conditions overnights until Father can demonstrate consistent sobriety and safe parenting will reduce risk to Michael while allowing Father to maintain and strengthen his relationship with his son.

36. The requested relief is consistent with the Court’s broad authority under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, to fashion orders that protect the child’s best interests and adjust parenting time in light of new and significant safety information. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736–38; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

37. Mother seeks a modification of the 2021 Judgment based upon the material and substantial change in circumstances described above and the best interests of Michael.

38. Specifically, Mother respectfully requests that this Court:

   a. Modify the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions of the 2021 Judgment to suspend Father’s unsupervised overnights with Michael until further order of the Court;

   b. Order that Father’s parenting time take place under supervision at a supervised visitation center or through a mutually agreeable third‑party supervisor approved by the Court, at least for all evening/overnight periods, for a period and under conditions the Court deems appropriate;

   c. In the alternative, if the Court does not order full supervision, impose reasonable conditions upon Father’s parenting time, including but not limited to:

   &emsp;i. A prohibition on Father consuming alcohol, marijuana, or any impairing substance for at least twenty‑four (24) hours before and during any period of parenting time;  
   &emsp;ii. Father’s agreement to submit to random alcohol and/or drug screening, with positive results to trigger immediate review and/or suspension of unsupervised parenting time;  
   &emsp;iii. Scheduling Father’s parenting time during daytime hours only, with no overnights, unless and until Father demonstrates sustained sobriety and compliance with all Court‑ordered conditions; and  
   &emsp;iv. Any other reasonable safeguards the Court finds necessary to protect Michael’s safety, sleep, and emotional well‑being.

   d. Maintain joint legal custody only to the extent consistent with Michael’s best interests; and if the Court finds that Father’s impairment or instability substantially interferes with effective joint decision‑making regarding Michael’s education, health, and welfare, award Mother sole legal custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31, subject to Father’s right to obtain information and participate in appropriate ways that do not compromise Michael’s welfare;

   e. Clarify that nothing in the modified order prevents Father from seeking future review or expansion of parenting time upon a documented and sustained period of sobriety, stability, and compliance with Court‑ordered conditions, consistent with Michael’s best interests;

   f. Award such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect Michael’s safety, health, and emotional well‑being.

### VIII. NO OTHER PENDING ACTIONS

39. Upon information and belief, there are no other pending actions in any court concerning custody of or parenting time with Michael, except as may be reflected in the existing Norfolk Probate and Family Court docket relating to the 2021 Judgment.

### IX. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28;

2. Find that the current custodial and parenting‑time arrangement, particularly concerning Father’s unsupervised overnight parenting time, is no longer in the best interests of the minor child, Michael Johnson;

3. Modify the 2021 Judgment to:

   a. Suspend Father’s unsupervised overnights and order supervised parenting time or, in the alternative, impose appropriate conditions and limitations on Father’s parenting time as set forth above;  
   b. Adjust legal custody, if necessary, to protect Michael’s welfare and to ensure effective, stable decision‑making in his best interests; and  
   c. Enter any and all additional orders necessary to safeguard Michael’s physical safety, emotional well‑being, and educational stability;

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JENNIFER SMITH
