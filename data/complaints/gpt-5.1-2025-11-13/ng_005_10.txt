COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01105.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual, upon information and belief residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts 01105, and is Plaintiff’s neighbor in a shared duplex property.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Hampden County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, which vests the Superior Court with original jurisdiction over civil actions for damages in excess of $50,000.

4. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the parties reside in Hampden County and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because he resides in Massachusetts and the tortious conduct alleged herein occurred within the Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3(c).

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Defendant resided in a duplex located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and shared use of a common driveway on the property.

7. The shared driveway is located immediately adjacent to a wooden fence on or near the boundary between Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s respective portions of the premises.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, controlled, and/or maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder, which he regularly stored outdoors on the premises.

9. For a substantial period of time prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant habitually left the aluminum extension ladder standing upright and leaning unsecured against the wooden fence, in close proximity to the area where Plaintiff regularly parked and maneuvered her vehicle in the shared driveway.

10. The aluminum ladder was of considerable height and weight, such that, if it were to be blown or knocked over, it posed a foreseeable risk of striking vehicles or persons using the driveway.

11. The ladder was not tied down, braced, anchored, or otherwise secured in a reasonably safe manner to prevent it from falling over in wind or other foreseeable conditions.

12. On multiple occasions before March 15, 2023, Plaintiff personally informed Defendant that she was concerned that the ladder, leaning unsecured against the wooden fence next to the parking area, might fall onto her car, particularly on windy days.

13. Plaintiff specifically warned Defendant that the ladder presented a danger and requested that he either move the ladder or adequately secure it so that it would not fall.

14. In response to Plaintiff’s concerns, Defendant acknowledged the issue and represented that he would tie the ladder down or move it to a safer location.

15. Despite these warnings and his assurances, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to secure, re‑position, or remove the ladder and left it standing, unsecured, leaning against the wooden fence at the edge of the shared driveway.

16. On March 15, 2023, it was a windy day in Springfield, Massachusetts, with gusts strong enough to present a foreseeable risk that a tall, unsecured aluminum extension ladder might be blown over.

17. On March 15, 2023, at approximately a time during daylight hours, Plaintiff was carefully backing her vehicle into the shared driveway at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01105.

18. As Plaintiff was backing into the driveway and maneuvering her car into her usual parking position near the wooden fence, a gust of wind struck the unsecured ladder.

19. Because the ladder was tall, lightweight, and not tied down or otherwise stabilized, the wind caused the ladder to topple over.

20. The falling ladder crashed directly onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle.

21. The impact from the ladder caused significant damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, including but not limited to a dented hood and a cracked windshield.

22. As a direct and proximate result of the falling ladder and resulting property damage, Plaintiff’s vehicle required bodywork repair and replacement of the damaged windshield.

23. Plaintiff’s vehicle remained in the repair shop for more than one week while the necessary bodywork and windshield replacement were performed.

24. Plaintiff had to pay her automobile insurance deductible in order to have her vehicle repaired.

25. Plaintiff also was required to rent a substitute vehicle for personal and household transportation while her own car was being repaired and was unavailable, incurring rental car charges.

26. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses for the deductible and rental vehicle costs, and suffered loss of use and enjoyment of her own vehicle during the repair period.

27. Plaintiff sustained no bodily injury requiring medical treatment and incurred approximately $0.00 in medical expenses and approximately $0.00 in lost wages.

28. Prior to March 15, 2023, it was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that leaving a tall aluminum ladder standing unsecured and leaning against a fence next to an active parking and maneuvering area in a shared driveway created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff’s property and potentially to persons using the driveway.

29. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that windy conditions were common and foreseeable in Springfield, Massachusetts in March, and that such wind could easily topple an unsecured ladder.

30. Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous condition because Plaintiff explicitly warned him about the risk that the ladder would fall onto her car.

31. Despite actual notice and the obvious nature of the risk, Defendant failed to remedy the condition, failed to reasonably secure the ladder, and failed to exercise ordinary care consistent with his duty as a landholder and neighbor sharing a driveway with Plaintiff.

32. At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised due care in backing her vehicle into the driveway and had no reason to believe that Defendant would continue to leave the ladder unsecure after assuring her that he would tie it down or move it.

33. Plaintiff’s property damage and related losses were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence in failing to secure or relocate the ladder and in allowing a dangerous condition to persist on or adjacent to the shared driveway.

34. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered property damage, out-of-pocket financial loss, inconvenience, and loss of use of her vehicle, and she is entitled to recover her damages under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

35. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

36. Under Massachusetts law, landowners and those in control of property owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors and to neighboring persons foreseeably exposed to risks arising from conditions on the premises. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (imposing a general duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995) (duty extends to foreseeable risks of harm).

37. A person who creates or maintains a condition on property that poses a foreseeable risk of harm has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injury or property damage to others. See *Janosz v. J.C. Penney Co.*, 324 Mass. 394, 396 (1949) (duty arises where harm is reasonably foreseeable); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006) (duty includes reasonable steps to prevent harm from dangerous conditions under one’s control).

38. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of the ladder and as a co-occupant of the premises sharing the driveway with Plaintiff, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage, placement, and securing of the ladder so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff or her property.

39. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty, upon receiving actual notice of the dangerous condition and the foreseeable risk of the ladder falling onto Plaintiff’s car, to take reasonable measures to correct or mitigate that condition. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 376–77 (2010) (duty of reasonable care to remedy or address known hazards); *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013) (duty to take reasonable steps once a risk is known or reasonably should be known).

**Breach**

40. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Storing a tall aluminum extension ladder in a standing, upright position, leaning directly against a wooden fence immediately adjacent to a parking and maneuvering area in the shared driveway;

   b. Failing to tie down, anchor, or otherwise secure the ladder in a reasonably safe manner to prevent it from falling over, particularly in windy conditions;

   c. Failing to relocate the ladder to a safer position away from the area where Plaintiff regularly parked and used her vehicle;

   d. Failing to heed Plaintiff’s repeated warnings and concerns that the ladder might fall onto her car, despite actual notice of the specific risk;

   e. Failing to act within a reasonable time after promising Plaintiff that he would tie down or move the ladder; and

   f. Permitting a dangerous and defective condition to exist and persist on or adjacent to the shared driveway.

41. A reasonably prudent person in Defendant’s position, exercising ordinary care under the circumstances, would not have left a tall aluminum ladder standing unsecured in an area exposed to wind and in close proximity to vehicles and persons using the shared driveway. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147–49 (foreseeability of harm informs the scope of reasonable care); *Koccora v. Horton*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 443–44 (1997) (negligence where defendant fails to secure object that foreseeably causes harm).

42. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of reasonable care required under Massachusetts common law negligence principles as reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 302, 303, 307, which Massachusetts courts routinely rely upon in articulating the duty and breach elements. See, e.g., *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (citing Restatement in negligence analysis).

**Causation**

43. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of the ladder falling on March 15, 2023, and of the resulting property damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle.

44. But for Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the ladder, the ladder would not have toppled over onto Plaintiff’s car when the wind gust occurred. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co.*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (causation satisfied where defendant’s negligence is a substantial contributing factor in the harm).

45. Defendant’s conduct created a foreseeable risk that, during windy conditions, the ladder would be blown over and would strike Plaintiff’s vehicle parked or being maneuvered in the driveway. The occurrence of such harm was well within the scope of the risk created by Defendant’s negligence. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996) (foreseeable consequences of negligent conduct give rise to liability).

46. Plaintiff’s own conduct was at all times reasonable and in the exercise of due care. To the extent Defendant asserts comparative negligence, Plaintiff denies any such negligence and states that, under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged negligence on her part, which is specifically denied, was not greater than Defendant’s negligence and in any event does not bar recovery.

**Damages**

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained damage to her vehicle, including but not limited to:

   a. Dented or otherwise damaged hood;

   b. Cracked and damaged windshield; and

   c. Related bodywork and repair damage associated with the ladder’s impact.

48. Plaintiff was required to have her vehicle repaired, including bodywork and replacement of the windshield, causing her to incur out-of-pocket expenses in the form of her automobile insurance deductible.

49. While her vehicle was in the repair shop for more than one week, Plaintiff was deprived of the use and enjoyment of her own vehicle and was reasonably required to rent a substitute vehicle, thereby incurring additional out-of-pocket rental car expenses.

50. Plaintiff has also experienced inconvenience, disruption to her daily activities, and loss of use of her property as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

51. Plaintiff’s medical expenses are approximately $0.00, and she lost approximately $0.00 in wages. Plaintiff’s claimed damages consist primarily of property damage, rental car expenses, deductible and other out-of-pocket expenses, and loss of use.

52. Plaintiff’s total damages for property loss, rental car expenses, loss of use, inconvenience, and other compensable harm are reasonably estimated to exceed the jurisdictional minimum for this Court. See G.L. c. 231, § 85A (burden of proof regarding property damage) and G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest on pecuniary damages in tort actions).

53. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages, together with statutory prejudgment interest from the date of commencement of the action pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and taxable costs. See *Ford v. Flaherty*, 364 Mass. 382, 385–86 (1973) (prejudgment interest is mandatory in tort actions for pecuniary damages).
