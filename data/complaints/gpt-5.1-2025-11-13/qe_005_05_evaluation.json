Thus, the case does not stand for the proposition that flooding and failure to correct it supported emotional distress damages under the quiet enjoyment claim itself, although it does hold that such flooding can constitute an interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.",

The court characterizes prior \u00a7 14 cases, including Doe v.

      "relevant_excerpt": "Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\n\n\u2026 in each case since the 1973 statutory revision in which we have recognized a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, there was evidence that the landlord failed to act reasonably in the circumstances concerning a problem known to the landlord, and the natural and probable consequences of such failure caused the interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises."
