COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20;  
M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 et seq.)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody judgment, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, is an individual who resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emma Mitchell (“Emma” or “the child”), born __________, 2013, who is presently age 12.

2. The Defendant, John Mitchell (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, and M.G.L. c. 208, § 31, because this is a post-judgment custody matter involving a prior judgment of this Court, and the child and both parents reside in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Norfolk Division of the Probate and Family Court Department pursuant to M.G.L. c. 215, § 3, and applicable rules because the prior custody judgment was entered in this Court and the parties and child reside in this county.

5. On or about May 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment (the “2019 Judgment”) concerning the custody and parenting plan for the minor child, Emma Mitchell.

6. The 2019 Judgment provided, among other things, that Mother and Father would share joint legal custody and joint physical custody of Emma, with a 50/50 week-on / week-off parenting schedule.

7. The 2019 Judgment was entered at a time when both parents lived in close proximity to each other, were in stable physical health, and were able to meaningfully and safely carry out the shared physical custody schedule.

8. The 2019 Judgment has been in effect since May 15, 2019. The parties have generally followed the alternating week-on / week-off schedule, and for several years the arrangement functioned reasonably well, with Emma maintaining consistent routines in both homes.

### II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

9. A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing judgment regarding custody and parenting time “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.” M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.

10. Under Massachusetts law, modification of custody requires (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–85 (2006); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842–43 (2003).

11. The “best interests of the child” is the paramount consideration in any custody determination. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Wilkins v. Wilkins*, 86 Mass. App. Ct. 665, 669 (2014); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).

12. In determining the best interests of the child, the Court must consider, among other factors, the child’s safety, stability, and well‑being, the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs, and any circumstance that may create risk of physical or emotional harm. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. 595, 599–600 (1981); *Dodge v. Dodge*, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 297–98 (1984).

13. A parent’s significant change in physical or mental health can constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting review and modification of a prior custody order, where it affects the parent’s ability to care safely for the child. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–86; *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704, 712–13 (1984); *Adoption of Ilona*, 459 Mass. 53, 61–62 (2011).

14. The Court has broad equitable authority under M.G.L. c. 215, § 6, and M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, to fashion a parenting plan that protects the child’s best interests, including adjusting a 50/50 schedule to a primary‑residence arrangement while preserving appropriate parenting time with the other parent. See *R.H. v. B.F.*, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 42–43 (1995); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409–10 (1976).

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

15. Since the entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, specifically involving Father’s health and physical limitations, which directly affects his ability to safely exercise shared physical custody of Emma on a 50/50, week‑on / week‑off schedule.

16. After the entry of the 2019 Judgment, and more recently within the past year, Father was diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that significantly affects his mobility, strength, balance, and speed of physical response.

17. Father’s neurological condition has worsened over time and is progressive in nature, meaning that his physical limitations are expected to increase rather than improve.

18. As a result of this condition, Father has experienced multiple falls in his home, including falls in areas that pose particular risk to a child, such as near stairs and other locations where quick physical response is necessary to prevent injury.

19. Upon information and belief, Father’s treating medical providers have advised him that, for safety reasons, he should not be alone with the child in situations where:

   a. there are unprotected stairs or other fall hazards;  
   b. the child would reasonably depend on Father for rapid physical response (for example, to prevent falls, respond to accidents, or urgently remove the child from danger); or  
   c. Father’s impaired mobility or balance could prevent him from providing basic physical assistance to the child in an emergency.

20. Notwithstanding this medical advice, Father has insisted on maintaining the exact same 50/50 week‑on / week‑off physical custody schedule that was ordered in 2019, without adjustment for his current physical limitations or safety concerns.

21. Father frequently uses a wheelchair and requires assistance for certain transfers and movements (for example, moving from his wheelchair to his bed or to other locations in the home).

22. During Father’s parenting time, he has on multiple occasions relied on Emma, at age 12, to assist him with tasks that are primarily attendant‑care or physical‑care tasks for an adult, including:

   a. helping Father move or transfer from wheelchair to bed;  
   b. retrieving objects, medications, or items that Father cannot safely access himself; and  
   c. providing physical assistance in and around the home that exceeds what is age‑appropriate for a 12‑year‑old child.

23. Emma has reported, and Mother has observed, that Emma feels anxious and responsible for Father’s physical safety when she is in his care, including fear that he may fall or be injured when she is the only other person present.

24. Emma has also expressed concern about situations where she is near stairs or other hazards with Father and is unsure whether he could protect or assist her quickly if an emergency arose.

25. Father’s current physical limitations, falls, and need for assistance have created an environment in which Emma is regularly placed in a role that is more akin to a caregiver for an adult, rather than a child being cared for by a parent.

26. The progressive nature of Father’s neurological condition reasonably indicates that the demands placed upon Emma and the safety risks in Father’s home are likely to increase if the existing 50/50 schedule continues unchanged.

27. These developments—Father’s diagnosis with a progressive neurological condition, his increasing physical limitations, repeated falls, medical advice regarding restrictions on his care of the child, and his ongoing reliance on Emma for his own bodily care—constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2019 Judgment, within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–43; *Wilkins v. Wilkins*, 86 Mass. App. Ct. at 669–70.

### IV. IMPACT ON THE CHILD AND BEST INTERESTS ANALYSIS

28. Emma is 12 years old and is in a developmental stage where stability, safety, and freedom from adult caregiving responsibilities are critical to her healthy emotional, psychological, and academic development. See *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. at 599–600.

29. The current 50/50 week‑on / week‑off physical custody arrangement, when combined with Father’s present physical limitations, exposes Emma to unnecessary physical risk, including:

   a. potential injury if Father falls while alone with Emma;  
   b. lack of immediate physical assistance from an unimpaired adult in case of emergencies such as fire, medical incidents, or accidents; and  
   c. emotional trauma associated with witnessing falls or injuries to Father.

30. Emma’s assumption of adult‑like caregiving tasks for Father is not age‑appropriate and places an undue emotional burden on her, potentially resulting in anxiety, stress, and role‑reversal within the parent‑child relationship. See *Adoption of Ilona*, 459 Mass. at 61–62 (discussing the importance of preserving a healthy parent‑child dynamic and protecting children from burdens harmful to their well‑being).

31. The best interests of the child standard in M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 requires the Court to prioritize Emma’s safety and emotional well‑being over strict adherence to a prior equal‑time parenting schedule that was based on factual circumstances that no longer exist. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843.

32. Mother does not seek to sever or unduly restrict Emma’s relationship with Father. Rather, Mother seeks to modify the parenting plan in a way that:

   a. ensures that Emma has a primary residence and primary caretaking parent who can reliably meet her physical and emotional needs without exposing her to unnecessary risk; and  
   b. preserves and supports Emma’s ongoing relationship and meaningful time with Father, in a manner consistent with his current physical abilities and with appropriate safety accommodations.

33. Mother is able and willing to serve as Emma’s primary residential parent and to assume the majority of Emma’s day‑to‑day physical care, educational support, and medical and extracurricular coordination.

34. Mother’s home is safe, stable, and fully accessible to Emma without requiring her to serve as a caregiver for an impaired adult.

35. Mother proposes that Father have parenting time that is:

   a. structured to occur in environments where Father’s physical limitations can be reasonably accommodated and monitored;  
   b. scheduled at times and for durations that do not over‑tax Father’s strength or place Emma in a position where she is the only available adult to assist Father physically; and  
   c. flexible enough to be adjusted based on Father’s health, medical advice, and any additional support services he may obtain.

36. The proposed modification is narrowly tailored to the changed circumstances: it recognizes that an equal 50/50 physical schedule is no longer safe or appropriate, while affirming the importance of maintaining Emma’s relationship with Father in a way that protects her from foreseeable harm.

37. Under Massachusetts law, where a material change has occurred and the existing judgment is no longer consistent with the child’s best interests, the Court has both the authority and the obligation to modify the custody and parenting time provisions. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85; *Wilkins v. Wilkins*, 86 Mass. App. Ct. at 669.

38. Continuing the existing 50/50 physical custody schedule in light of Father’s progressive neurological condition and related safety concerns would be inconsistent with Emma’s best interests and with the protective purposes of Massachusetts custody law. See *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. at 599–600; *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. at 712–13.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

39. Mother respectfully requests that the 2019 Judgment be modified to designate Mother as Emma’s primary physical custodian, with Emma’s primary residence to be with Mother, while maintaining joint legal custody unless and until further order of the Court.

40. Mother further requests that Father’s parenting time be modified to reflect his current abilities and the child’s safety, including but not limited to:

   a. Regular, meaningful parenting time with Father (for example, on specified afternoons, evenings, or weekends) in a manner and setting that is medically and physically safe for both Father and Emma;  

   b. Consideration of whether some or all of Father’s parenting time should occur:  
      i. in a single‑level or accessible environment with minimized fall risks;  
      ii. with the presence of an additional competent adult or home health aide when needed for physical transfers or mobility; or  
      iii. for durations that are appropriate in light of Father’s stamina and ability to supervise Emma safely without relying on her for physical assistance;  

   c. Vacations, holidays, and special occasions to be allocated in a way that protects Emma’s safety while preserving her opportunity to maintain a loving relationship with Father; and  

   d. A provision allowing for reasonable adjustments to Father’s parenting time based on updated medical evaluations and the availability of any support services that improve safety.

41. Mother also requests that the Court order any additional provisions it deems just and proper to safeguard Emma’s physical and emotional well‑being, including, if necessary:

   a. requirements for communication between the parties regarding any significant changes in Father’s medical condition that may affect Emma’s safety;  
   b. authorization for either party to request future review of the parenting plan if there is a further material change in circumstances; and  
   c. any safety‑related measures recommended by a guardian ad litem or other professional, if appointed.

42. The relief requested is consistent with the principles set forth in M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and is supported by Massachusetts appellate decisions emphasizing that custody and parenting time orders must be modified when necessary to protect the child’s best interests in light of materially changed circumstances. See, e.g., *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704; *Wilkins v. Wilkins*, 86 Mass. App. Ct. 665; *Custody of a Minor*, 383 Mass. 595; *Adoption of Ilona*, 459 Mass. 53; *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704; *Dodge v. Dodge*, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 292; *R.H. v. B.F.*, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2019 Judgment, specifically with respect to the Defendant’s progressive neurological condition and its impact on the existing 50/50 physical custody arrangement;

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting time provisions is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child, Emma Mitchell;

3. Modify the prior Judgment to award primary physical custody and primary residence of Emma Mitchell to the Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, with joint legal custody to remain with both parents unless otherwise ordered;

4. Establish a revised parenting plan for the Defendant, John Mitchell, providing him with frequent and meaningful parenting time that is structured to ensure the safety and well‑being of Emma in light of his current physical limitations, including any safety accommodations, supervision, or environmental adjustments that the Court deems appropriate;

5. Enter any necessary orders regarding holidays, school vacations, and special occasions consistent with Emma’s best interests and the Defendant’s medical and physical limitations;

6. Order that both parties shall keep each other reasonably informed of any significant changes in the child’s health, schooling, and major activities, and that Father shall inform Mother of any significant changes in his medical condition that may materially affect Emma’s safety while in his care;

7. Reserve jurisdiction to modify the parenting plan in the future upon a further material change in circumstances or upon motion of either party;

8. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests, safety, and emotional welfare of the minor child, Emma Mitchell.

Respectfully submitted,  

Plaintiff,  
SARAH MITCHELL,  
pro se
