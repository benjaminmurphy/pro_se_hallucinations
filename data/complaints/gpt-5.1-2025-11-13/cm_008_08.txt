RACHEL THOMPSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.  

---------------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
---------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 208, § 31, G.L. c. 215, and the court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody orders, and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, is an individual residing in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Samantha Johnson.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is an individual, believed to reside in or near Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Samantha Johnson.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, Samantha Johnson, date of birth __________ (age 10).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court, the Suffolk Division of the Probate and Family Court Department, has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, and G.L. c. 215, as this is a Complaint for Modification of an existing custody and parenting-time order/judgment previously issued by this Court.

5. Venue in Suffolk County is proper because the prior Judgment regarding custody and parenting time was issued by the Suffolk County Probate and Family Court, and the child resides in this county within the meaning of applicable law and court practice.

6. The Court has continuing jurisdiction over the custody, visitation, and parenting-time provisions of its prior Judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law. See, e.g., *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

7. On or about May 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment (and/or Divorce/Separate Support/Parenting Judgment) (the “2022 Judgment”) concerning the custody of the minor child, Samantha Johnson.

8. Under the 2022 Judgment, the parties were awarded joint legal custody of Samantha, with the Mother designated as the primary residential parent.

9. Under the 2022 Judgment, the Father was granted substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sunday, such that the Father typically returns Samantha to school or to the Mother’s care on Mondays.

10. The 2022 Judgment requires the parents to cooperate on school-related matters, keep each other reasonably informed regarding the child’s education, and make decisions consistent with Samantha’s best interests and educational needs.

11. At the time the 2022 Judgment was entered, Samantha was attending school regularly, was performing satisfactorily in her classes, and was not the subject of truancy warnings or educational neglect concerns.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the 2022 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting Samantha’s welfare and best interests, particularly with respect to her school attendance and academic performance. These changes were not anticipated at the time of the 2022 Judgment and now warrant modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions.

13. Over the past year, the Father has repeatedly kept Samantha home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, asserting that she “needs a mental health day,” without obtaining or providing any medical or mental-health provider documentation to justify these absences.

14. The Father’s pattern of keeping Samantha out of school on Mondays has resulted in a series of unexcused absences and/or absences without medical documentation, concentrated on days following his parenting time.

15. As a direct result of these absences, the school has issued truancy warnings or notices regarding Samantha’s attendance, placing the Mother in a position of receiving communications that the child may be truant or at risk of further action by the school district.

16. Samantha’s grades, test scores, and overall academic performance have declined since this pattern of Monday absences began. This decline is evidenced by recent report cards, progress reports, and standardized test scores showing a clear deterioration compared to her performance prior to the pattern of absences.

17. In addition to keeping Samantha out of school on Mondays, the Father has regularly refused or failed to bring Samantha to scheduled tutoring sessions that fall during his weekend parenting time, despite knowing that Samantha’s tutoring is designed to address her academic struggles and to remedy the educational impact of missed school days.

18. The Father’s refusal to bring Samantha to tutoring, combined with his practice of withholding her from school on Mondays, undermines Samantha’s educational progress and interferes with the Mother’s efforts to support the child’s learning and comply with school attendance requirements.

19. The Father has not arranged any alternative educational services on the Mondays he keeps Samantha home, nor has he provided structured educational activities equivalent to normal school attendance, thereby compounding the educational harm to the child.

20. The Mother has communicated with the Father about the importance of consistent school attendance, the significance of the truancy warnings, and the impact of missed days and missed tutoring on Samantha’s grades. Despite this, the Father has continued this pattern of absences and non-cooperation.

21. The Father’s actions demonstrate an unwillingness or inability to place Samantha’s educational needs first during his parenting time, and his conduct has substantially interfered with the joint decision-making contemplated by the 2022 Judgment.

22. The cumulative effect of the Father’s conduct—recurrent unexcused absences following his weekends, failure to take Samantha to tutoring, and disregard of truancy concerns—is a material change in circumstances that adversely affects Samantha’s educational welfare and overall best interests.

23. The Mother remains willing and able to foster Samantha’s education, ensure consistent school attendance, facilitate tutoring, and cooperate with the school and with the Father as appropriate. However, the existing custody and parenting-time structure, as currently written, permits the Father to continue making unilateral decisions that directly harm Samantha’s educational progress.

24. Continued adherence to the 2022 Judgment, without modification, is no longer in Samantha’s best interests because it allows ongoing educational disruption, increases the risk of school-based truancy intervention, and undermines Samantha’s long-term academic and emotional well-being.

### V. APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL STANDARD

25. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify a prior custody or parenting-time order where a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the child. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

26. G.L. c. 208, § 28 provides that the Court may make a new order relative to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require,” thereby authorizing modification when a prior order no longer serves the child’s welfare.

27. G.L. c. 208, § 31 defines the rights and responsibilities of parents under legal and physical custody arrangements and directs the Court to allocate custody in accordance with the “best interests of the child.”  

28. Massachusetts appellate decisions make clear that the “best interests of the child” is the paramount consideration in custody matters, outweighing the interests or preferences of either parent. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).

29. The Court may modify legal custody or decision-making authority where the parties are unable to cooperate on matters of significant importance to the child, such as education, or where one parent’s conduct consistently undermines the child’s welfare. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (joint legal custody inappropriate where parents cannot communicate and cooperate); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (modification appropriate upon material change affecting child’s welfare).

30. The Court has recognized that stability, consistent school attendance, educational progress, and the avoidance of truancy and chronic absenteeism are central to a child’s best interests. While not limited to any one factor, the Court may consider the child’s educational needs, school performance, and attendance in evaluating custody and parenting-time arrangements. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–843; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–596.

31. Where the existing parenting schedule impairs a child’s school attendance and educational progress, the Court may modify the schedule to reduce overnights that conflict with school or to allocate final decision-making authority on school attendance and educational issues to the parent more likely to support the child’s academic needs. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Miller v. Miller*, 448 Mass. 320 (2007); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (recognizing broad discretion of the Probate and Family Court to fashion orders in the child’s best interests).

32. The Father’s repeated decisions to keep Samantha home from school without medical justification, in the face of truancy warnings and declining grades, constitute a material change in circumstances bearing directly on her welfare and demonstrate that the current joint legal decision-making and Sunday-night overnight arrangement are not working as originally intended.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

33. It is in Samantha’s best interests to attend school regularly, to avoid unexcused absences, and to receive consistent educational support, including tutoring as recommended by her teachers or school counselors.

34. It is in Samantha’s best interests that at least one parent be clearly responsible for making final decisions regarding school attendance, educational services, and tutoring, in order to prevent further disruption and truancy concerns.

35. The Mother has demonstrated that she prioritizes Samantha’s education, responds to school communications, and supports tutoring and other interventions designed to improve Samantha’s academic performance.

36. The Father has demonstrated through his pattern of conduct that he does not consistently place Samantha’s educational needs first, that he is willing to disregard school attendance requirements for non-medical reasons, and that he has refused or failed to bring Samantha to tutoring sessions during his parenting time.

37. The current structure of joint legal custody, without any tie‑breaking authority on educational issues, and the continuation of Sunday-night overnights that routinely lead into Monday absences, permit the Father to continue behavior that harms Samantha’s educational welfare.

38. A modification granting the Mother final decision-making authority on all education-related issues (including but not limited to school attendance, tutoring, and coordination with the school) or, in the alternative, reducing or eliminating the Father’s Sunday-night overnights during the school year, is reasonably calculated to protect Samantha’s best interests and to remedy the ongoing educational harm.

39. The requested relief does not seek to interfere unnecessarily with the Father’s relationship with Samantha; rather, it seeks to ensure that the Father’s parenting time does not come at the expense of Samantha’s fundamental right to a stable, consistent, and uninterrupted education.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that since the entry of the May 15, 2022 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s welfare, particularly with respect to school attendance and academic performance.

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Samantha Johnson.

C. Modify the 2022 Judgment to provide that:

   1. The parties shall continue to share legal custody in general, but the Mother shall have final decision-making authority with respect to all educational matters for Samantha, including but not limited to:
      a. School attendance and decisions regarding when Samantha will or will not attend school;  
      b. Enrollment in and attendance at tutoring, extra help, or other remedial or enrichment educational services;  
      c. Responses to truancy warnings, attendance plans, and other school-initiated interventions; and  
      d. Coordination and communication with Samantha’s teachers, school administrators, counselors, and service providers.

   2. The Father shall not unilaterally keep Samantha out of school on any scheduled school day absent:
      a. A bona fide illness or medical condition, and  
      b. Compliance with school policies concerning notification and, when appropriate, medical documentation.

   3. The Father shall ensure that Samantha attends all tutoring sessions, extra help, or academic support services that fall during his parenting time, unless the Mother provides written notice that a particular session has been cancelled or rescheduled.

   4. In the alternative, or in addition, the Court may modify the Father’s parenting schedule as follows, if the Court determines that such schedule modification is required to safeguard Samantha’s education:
      a. During the school year (defined as any period in which school is in regular session), the Father’s Sunday parenting time shall end at a reasonable hour on Sunday evening (e.g., 5:00 p.m. or such other time as the Court deems appropriate), with Samantha returning to the Mother’s care Sunday night so that the Mother can ensure her timely attendance at school on Monday; and/or  
      b. Any additional overnights that occur on school nights may be reduced, eliminated, or restructured to avoid recurring absenteeism or tardiness on school days following the Father’s parenting time.

   5. The parties shall communicate in good faith about Samantha’s education, and the Father shall promptly notify the Mother of any school-related issues, disciplinary matters, or concerns that arise during his parenting time.

D. Order that the parties comply with any reasonable attendance plan or requirements imposed by Samantha’s school, and authorize the Mother, as final educational decision-maker, to sign such plans on Samantha’s behalf.

E. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the child, including any additional orders necessary to protect Samantha’s educational welfare.

### VIII. REQUEST FOR HEARING

The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Complaint for Modification be scheduled for hearing at the earliest practicable date, and that after hearing, the Court enter a modified order consistent with the relief requested herein.
