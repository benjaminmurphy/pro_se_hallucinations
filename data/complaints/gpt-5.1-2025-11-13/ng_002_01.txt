### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully present in Newton, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, kept, or controlled a dog that he brought to Newton Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the $7,000 jurisdictional minimum of the District Court Department when considering medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, but does not exceed the jurisdictional maximum of the District Court. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A.

5. Venue is proper in the Newton Division of the District Court Department because the incident that is the subject of this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, § 2; G.L. c. 223, § 3.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 15, 2023, at approximately the afternoon hours, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a paved or maintained path in Newton Park, located at or near 123 Maple Street, Newton, Massachusetts (“Newton Park”).

7. Newton Park is a public park within the City of Newton that, upon information and belief, is subject to municipal ordinances and posted rules requiring that all dogs be kept on a leash at all times.

8. On the date and time of the incident, prominent signs were posted in Newton Park stating that all dogs must be on leashes, or words to that effect.

9. Defendant was present in Newton Park at the same time as Plaintiff, accompanied by a large dog owned, kept, or controlled by Defendant.

10. Defendant had with him a dog leash, which he was holding or carrying on or over his shoulder, but he had not attached the leash to the dog.

11. Defendant knowingly and intentionally allowed his dog to run loose and off-leash in Newton Park in violation of posted park rules and applicable municipal leash requirements.

12. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from the jogging path where Plaintiff was running, engaged in conversation with friends, and was not paying adequate attention to the actions and movements of his dog.

13. As Plaintiff was jogging along the path in a normal and reasonable manner, Defendant’s dog suddenly and without warning ran at high speed toward Plaintiff, charging directly at her from the side or front.

14. As the dog charged, it barked loudly and aggressively in a manner that would cause a reasonable person in Plaintiff’s position to fear being bitten or otherwise attacked.

15. At the time of the charge, the dog was completely unleashed and under insufficient or no physical control by Defendant.

16. Plaintiff saw and heard the dog charging and barking and reasonably perceived an imminent risk that the dog would bite her or collide with her.

17. Plaintiff had no duty or ability to control Defendant’s dog and had no prior relationship with Defendant or the dog.

18. In an instinctive effort to avoid being bitten or struck by the charging, barking dog, Plaintiff reasonably swerved off the paved path away from the dog’s approach.

19. In the course of this evasive maneuver, Plaintiff’s foot or feet struck or became entangled with a tree root or similar natural obstruction located just off the edge of the path.

20. As a direct result, Plaintiff lost her balance and fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path.

21. Plaintiff landed with substantial force on the ground, using her hands and arms in an attempt to break the fall, and immediately experienced significant pain in her wrist.

22. Defendant’s dog stopped when Plaintiff fell, and only then did Defendant call the dog back to him and regain control.

23. Upon information and belief, several other joggers and/or park users observed the dog running off leash, charging at Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s evasive maneuver, and her subsequent fall and injury.

24. Plaintiff did not provoke the dog in any manner and was exercising due care and reasonable caution in jogging on the park path.

25. The dog did not physically contact Plaintiff, but the dog’s charging and barking behavior directly caused Plaintiff’s reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm and her immediate evasive response.

26. But for Defendant’s negligent failure to keep the dog leashed and under control, the dog would not have charged Plaintiff, and Plaintiff would not have had to swerve off the path or fall down the embankment.

27. Plaintiff’s fall caused a fracture of her wrist, diagnosed as a broken or fractured wrist at a hospital emergency department.

28. Following the incident, Plaintiff was transported or presented herself to an emergency room where she received medical evaluation, diagnostic imaging, and treatment for her injuries.

29. Plaintiff’s medical care included, but was not limited to, emergency department services, imaging (such as X‑rays), immobilization of the wrist with a brace or splint, follow-up medical visits, and associated treatment.

30. Plaintiff was required to wear a wrist brace for an extended period of time, causing discomfort, limitation of movement, and interference with her daily activities.

31. Plaintiff’s injuries prevented her from performing her regular job duties for a period of time, resulting in lost wages in an approximate amount of $1,200.

32. Plaintiff also missed a piano recital that she had been practicing for, experiencing emotional distress, frustration, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result.

33. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date are approximately $3,500, and she reasonably anticipates future medical care and potential future pain, suffering, and limitations.

34. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, loss of function, and limitations relating to her wrist injury.

35. Plaintiff has also suffered mental anguish, anxiety, and emotional distress attributable to the sudden, frightening incident involving Defendant’s dog and the resulting injuries.

36. All of the above-described harms and damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct and failure to exercise reasonable care in controlling and leashing his dog in Newton Park.

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (COMMON LAW)

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

38. Under Massachusetts law, a person who owns, keeps, or controls a dog owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the dog from causing foreseeable injury to others. See *Maillet v. Mininno*, 266 Mass. 86, 89 (1929) (recognizing liability where owner fails to exercise reasonable care in control of dog); *Wright v. Clark*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 1108 (2000) (Rule 1:28 decision) (upholding negligence claim based on failure to control dog).

39. Independently and additionally, a person using a public place such as a park owes a general duty of reasonable care to foreseeable users of that park, including joggers such as Plaintiff. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (duty to exercise reasonable care where conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm to others); *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 731–32 (2000).

40. The existence of municipal leash ordinances and posted park rules requiring dogs to be kept on leashes further defines the standard of care for dog owners and keepers in Newton Park and renders the risk of harm to park users from unleashed dogs clearly foreseeable. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990) (statutes or regulations may inform standard of reasonable care); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (defining duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors).

41. Defendant, as the owner, keeper, or person in control of the dog, owed Plaintiff a duty to act with reasonable care to secure and control his dog, to comply with posted leash rules and applicable ordinances, and to avoid exposing Plaintiff and other park users to unreasonable risk of harm.

#### Breach

42. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to keep his dog on a leash in Newton Park despite clearly posted signs requiring all dogs to be leashed;

   b. Allowing his dog to run free and unsupervised at a distance of approximately thirty (30) feet from him;

   c. Failing to maintain adequate physical control of the dog even though he possessed a leash;

   d. Failing to pay proper attention to the dog’s movements and behavior while he was engaged in conversation with friends;

   e. Allowing or failing to prevent the dog from charging toward Plaintiff at high speed while barking loudly in an aggressive or threatening manner; and

   f. Failing to take timely and reasonable steps to recall or restrain the dog before it charged at Plaintiff and caused her to take evasive action.

43. Defendant’s conduct in violating posted leash requirements constitutes strong evidence of negligence and a failure to act as a reasonably prudent dog owner would act under similar circumstances, particularly in a public park with joggers and pedestrians. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. at 359–60; *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401, 406 (1991) (violation of safety-related regulations may be considered on issue of negligence).

44. Defendant knew or should have known that allowing a large dog to run off leash in a public park created an unreasonable risk that the dog might run toward, startle, or otherwise cause injury to joggers and other park users.

45. A reasonably prudent person in Defendant’s position would have foreseen that an unleashed dog charging and barking at a runner could cause the runner to take sudden evasive action and fall or otherwise be injured. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 149–51 (foreseeability of risk as central to duty and breach analysis); *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996).

#### Causation

46. Defendant’s negligent conduct was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (plaintiff must show that defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing harm).

47. Defendant’s failure to leash and control his dog allowed the dog to charge and bark at Plaintiff, thereby creating a sudden and reasonable fear of an imminent dog attack.

48. Plaintiff’s immediate, instinctive reaction—swerving off the path to avoid the charging dog—was a natural, foreseeable, and reasonable response to the danger created by Defendant’s negligence and does not break the chain of causation. See *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co.*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987) (foreseeable intervening acts do not relieve original tortfeasor); *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 104–05 (1978).

49. The presence of the tree root and the embankment was a normal condition of the park environment and did not constitute a superseding cause; rather, it was the manner in which Plaintiff, as a reasonably prudent person, was forced to react to Defendant’s unleashed, charging dog that directly resulted in her fall and wrist fracture.

50. “But for” Defendant’s negligence in failing to leash and control his dog, the dog would not have charged Plaintiff, Plaintiff would not have needed to swerve off the path, and Plaintiff would not have fallen and fractured her wrist. See *Doull v. Foster*, 487 Mass. 1, 14–16 (2021) (discussing “but-for” causation in negligence).

51. Defendant’s negligence was also a substantial factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s injuries and damages and was within the scope of the foreseeable risks created by his conduct. See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. at 320–21.

#### Damages

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist, physical pain, and physical impairment.

53. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses in an amount of approximately $3,500, and may incur additional medical expenses in the future.

54. Plaintiff has lost wages in an amount of approximately $1,200 due to her inability to work for a period of time following the incident.

55. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, pain and suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life, including but not limited to the loss of the opportunity to participate in and perform at a piano recital for which she had been preparing.

56. Plaintiff’s damages are recoverable under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to the common law of negligence as articulated in *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 146–47; *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. at 707–08; *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 548–49 (1982) (recognizing recovery for physical injuries and associated emotional harms).

57. Plaintiff’s total damages exceed $7,000 when medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering are considered, and may increase with future medical treatment and ongoing pain and limitations.

58. To the extent that Defendant may contend that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, Plaintiff denies that she was negligent in any respect. In the alternative, any negligence on the part of Plaintiff was substantially less than that of Defendant and merely reduces, rather than bars, recovery under G.L. c. 231, § 85. See *Colter v. Barber-Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 64 (1988).

59. Plaintiff acted as a reasonably prudent person would act under the circumstances by attempting to avoid what she reasonably perceived as an imminent dog attack.

---

### V. COMPLIANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS LAW

60. This Complaint is brought within the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions under G.L. c. 260, § 2A, as the incident occurred on May 15, 2023, and this action is commenced thereafter within the three-year limitations period.

61. Plaintiff asserts only a common-law negligence claim against Defendant and does not assert a statutory strict-liability claim under G.L. c. 140, § 155.

62. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 and applicable Massachusetts law.
