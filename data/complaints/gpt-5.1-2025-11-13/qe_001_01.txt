BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT  
DORCHESTER DIVISION  

------------------------------------------------------  
JESSICA TURNER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                              Civil Action No. ___________

MICHAEL ROBERTS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Michael Roberts (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing in Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is a tenant of the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Michael Roberts is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the multi‑unit residential property that includes the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts.

3. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant has been the landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239 and has been responsible for maintaining the Premises and providing utilities and services required by law and by the rental agreement.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 212, § 3 because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Boston Municipal Court and the claims arise under the statutes and common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the Premises are located in Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this Division.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully set forth herein.

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the rental of a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Apartment is $1,800, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Apartment as her primary residence since on or about January 1, 2022.

10. As a matter of Massachusetts law, all residential tenancies include an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

11. Massachusetts law and regulations require landlords to provide heat sufficient to maintain minimum temperatures in residential dwellings during the heating season. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 CMR 410.201 (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

12. During the winter heating season of 2024–2025, and particularly during approximately December 2024 through March 2025, the heating system serving the Apartment repeatedly malfunctioned.

13. On multiple days and evenings during that winter period, the heat in the Apartment would “cut out” or substantially decline for periods of several hours at a time, often in the evenings.

14. During those episodes, the temperature in the Apartment dropped to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for extended periods.

15. These temperature levels are below what is required by the State Sanitary Code and building health and safety standards and rendered the Apartment unreasonably cold and uncomfortable for normal residential use.

16. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating problems and requested repairs.

17. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on at least two occasions during the winter.

18. After the first service visit, the heating system functioned adequately for approximately one week, but then the recurring problem of the heat dropping to around 60 degrees for several hours at a time returned.

19. After the second service visit, the repair person informed Plaintiff that the boiler serving the Apartment was “old but functional” and that there was not much more that could be done.

20. Despite this representation, the problems with the heat did, in fact, continue to recur after the second visit.

21. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the heating system was old, inadequate, and prone to malfunction, and that further or more substantial repair or replacement was required to provide legally adequate heat.

22. Defendant failed to take reasonable and effective steps to provide reliable, code‑compliant heat to the Apartment during the heating season.

23. Defendant has asserted to Plaintiff that the heat is “working” because it never went completely out and the building “isn’t freezing,” and has refused to take further remedial action.

24. The fact that the heat never went completely off does not excuse Defendant’s failure to provide heat that meets legal requirements and does not prevent liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 103–04 (1982) (covenant of quiet enjoyment may be breached by a pattern of significant, ongoing interferences even without complete deprivation); see also Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

25. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat, Plaintiff was compelled to purchase and use two electric space heaters to make the Apartment sufficiently warm for regular living.

26. The operation of those space heaters substantially increased Plaintiff’s electricity usage and caused her electric bill to increase by approximately $150 per month during the winter heating period when they were in use.

27. This additional cost was directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat as required by law and by the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

28. In or about January 2025, during the period when the Apartment was repeatedly unreasonably cold, Plaintiff developed bronchitis.

29. Plaintiff’s medical provider informed her that the cold indoor air and substandard heating conditions likely exacerbated or contributed to her illness.

30. As a result of her illness, Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work and incurred out‑of‑pocket medical costs, including costs associated with antibiotics and related treatment.

31. The unreasonably cold conditions in the Apartment substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, including her ability to sleep comfortably, perform daily activities, and maintain reasonable health and safety.

32. Defendant’s failure to provide legally adequate heat constitutes a failure to maintain the Premises in compliance with applicable State Sanitary Code and housing standards, which in turn constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982); Hemingway v. Boston Housing Auth., 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

33. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid, or stood ready and willing to pay, the agreed‑upon rent of $1,800 per month, subject to any lawful abatements, offsets, or counterclaims she may have as a result of Defendant’s violations.

34. Defendant’s conduct was at least negligent and, in light of repeated notice and continuing violations of basic habitability standards, was willful, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory rights.

35. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered damages of at least $500, consisting of increased utility costs, medical expenses, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment; Plaintiff reserves the right to prove additional damages at trial.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

36. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 35 as if fully set forth herein.

37. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” and is liable for actual and statutory damages where such interference is found, including the possibility of multiple damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.

38. Under Massachusetts law, substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased premises, including failure to maintain the premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code or to provide essential services such as heat, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

39. The implied warranty of habitability recognized in Hemingway v. Boston Housing Auth., 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., including 105 CMR 410.201 requiring adequate heat, form part of Plaintiff’s tenancy and define the minimum standards of habitability that the landlord must meet.

40. Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain adequate and code‑compliant heat during the winter heating season, despite notice of recurring failures and despite his legal obligations under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and 105 CMR 410.201, constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

41. The repeated drops in temperature in the Apartment to approximately 60 degrees for hours at a time during winter months deprived Plaintiff of the full, safe, and comfortable use of her home and caused her to incur additional expenses and health impacts.

42. Under Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), and related cases, a series of significant interferences with essential services and sanitary conditions, even absent complete abandonment of the premises, is sufficient to establish a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

43. Defendant’s conduct occurred after Plaintiff took possession of the Premises and was therefore within the scope of G.L. c. 186, § 14, as interpreted in Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–104, and Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

44. Defendant’s failure to take effective remedial action after being notified of the heating problems constitutes “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, because Defendant knew or should have known that his inaction would result in continued substandard heating and interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises.

45. The pattern of substandard heat and resulting conditions was sufficiently serious to amount to a constructive eviction in whole or in part, although Plaintiff, for reasons of necessity, remained in possession of the Premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Dukes v. Durante, 192 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (Rule 1:28 decision) (tenant may recover for breach even if she remains in possession).

46. The failure to provide adequate heat also constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code and G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, which has been recognized as evidence of both breach of the implied warranty of habitability and breach of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977).

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

    a. Increased electricity costs due to required use of space heaters (approximately $150 per month during the relevant winter months);

    b. Medical expenses and lost wages related to bronchitis exacerbated by the unreasonably cold conditions in the Apartment;

    c. Discomfort, distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises due to the cold, unhealthy indoor temperatures.

48. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages, and, because Defendant’s conduct was at least in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory and sanitary code rights after repeated notice, Defendant is liable for multiple damages (up to three times actual damages) and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, even though Plaintiff is self‑represented. See, e.g., Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979); Henderson v. D’Annolfo, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 413 (1983).

49. In addition, G.L. c. 93A, § 9 and related consumer protection caselaw (including Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151 (1985)), while not separately pled here as a cause of action, reinforce the strong public policy in Massachusetts against unfair and deceptive acts and practices by residential landlords and underscore the seriousness of Defendant’s failures to comply with basic health and safety obligations.  

50. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to recovery of her actual damages, any statutory or multiple damages available under G.L. c. 186, § 14, and her costs of suit.

---

### V. DAMAGES

51. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 50 as if fully set forth herein.

52. Plaintiff has incurred increased electric utility charges of approximately $150 per month during multiple winter months in which she was forced to use space heaters because Defendant failed to provide adequate heat.

53. Plaintiff has incurred out‑of‑pocket medical costs, including the cost of antibiotics and related care for bronchitis in or about January 2025, along with lost wages for approximately three missed days of work.

54. Plaintiff has suffered discomfort, distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment due to the recurrent unreasonably cold conditions.

55. Plaintiff presently estimates her damages at approximately $500, but reserves the right to amend this estimate as discovery proceeds and to seek all additional relief permitted by law, including multiple damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on the claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

C. Award Plaintiff multiple damages as authorized by G.L. c. 186, § 14, based on Defendant’s willful, knowing, or reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights;

D. Award Plaintiff her costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs;
