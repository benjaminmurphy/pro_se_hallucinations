  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL SANDERS,  
  Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME / CONDITIONS OF CONTACT)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Michael Sanders (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Liam Sanders (date of birth: __________; age 8) and Ava Sanders (date of birth: __________; age 6) (collectively, “the children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Sanders, upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable), G.L. c. 215, § 6, and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions of G.L. c. 209B, because the children reside in Massachusetts and have done so for more than six months prior to the filing of this Complaint, and Middlesex Probate and Family Court issued the existing custody judgment.

4. On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (the “2021 Judgment”) establishing custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor children.

5. Under the 2021 Judgment, the parties share legal custody (unless otherwise ordered), with Mother having primary physical custody, and Father having parenting time consisting of alternate weekends and one midweek visit (the “Existing Parenting Plan”).

6. The 2021 Judgment was entered at a time when neither party was in a serious romantic relationship, and the judgment contains no provisions addressing exposure of the children to new romantic partners, step-parents, or other household members or conditions concerning third parties in the children’s presence.

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

7. Since the entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties and the children that directly affects the children’s safety, welfare, and best interests.

8. After the entry of the 2021 Judgment, Father entered into a serious romantic relationship and now cohabits with an adult (hereinafter, “the Paramour”), whose full name is presently unknown to Mother.

9. Upon information and belief, the Paramour has a criminal record in Massachusetts, including at least one conviction or charge for assault and battery, in violation of G.L. c. 265, § 13A, and has previously been the subject of an abuse prevention order pursuant to G.L. c. 209A obtained by a prior intimate partner.

10. The Paramour’s presence and conduct in Father’s household significantly affects the conditions under which the children exercise parenting time with Father and presents concerns about their emotional and physical safety.

11. The children have reported to Mother that the Paramour frequently yells in their presence, uses a raised and aggressive tone, and slams doors in anger while the children are in the home.

12. On one occasion, one of the children reported that the Paramour grabbed the child’s arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark. Mother observed a mark on the child’s arm consistent with the report.

13. The children have expressed fear and anxiety regarding the Paramour’s temper and behavior, including being frightened by yelling, loud arguments, and slamming doors.

14. On at least one occasion when the children were present in Father’s home, a neighbor called the police to respond to a loud argument involving Father and/or the Paramour, demonstrating that the level of conflict and volatility in the household rose to the level that a third party believed police intervention was necessary.

15. The exposure of the children to a household member with a known history of violence and a prior abuse prevention order, combined with recent incidents of yelling, aggressive behavior, physical grabbing, and police involvement, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2021 Judgment.

16. These events and living conditions were not anticipated, contemplated, or addressed at the time of the 2021 Judgment and could not reasonably have been within the contemplation of the Court when it entered that order.

17. In light of the foregoing, continuation of the Existing Parenting Plan without appropriate safeguards or modifications presents a substantial risk to the children’s emotional well‑being and potentially to their physical safety.

### III. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD

18. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting-time judgment may be modified when (1) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).

19. The best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination or modification. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003).

20. The Court is required to consider the effect of domestic violence, abuse, or a pattern of coercive or controlling behavior on the best interests of the child and on custody and parenting-time decisions. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 209C, § 10; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845–46.

21. While a parent’s choice of romantic partner is generally a matter of personal autonomy, Massachusetts courts may impose reasonable conditions on parenting time when the presence or conduct of a third party poses a risk to a child’s safety or welfare. See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 658–59 (2002) (recognizing broad equitable powers of Probate and Family Court to fashion orders protecting children’s welfare); Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232, 234–35 (1981) (upholding court’s power to impose restrictions in the child’s best interests).

22. The Probate and Family Court has broad equitable authority to enter orders necessary to protect children and to craft parenting-time conditions tailored to the family’s circumstances, including supervised parenting time, requirements regarding the presence of third parties, and conditions to ensure safety. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 215, § 6; Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43.

23. Massachusetts law recognizes that exposure to domestic violence or to a violent household—whether or not the child is the direct victim—is highly relevant to the best-interests analysis and may warrant modification of custody or parenting-time orders. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26; Adoption of Simone, 427 Mass. 34, 43–44 (1998).

24. In determining whether a modification is in the children’s best interests, the Court may consider the emotional stability of the home, the presence of conflict, and the impact of the parent’s associates or household members on the children’s safety and well‑being. See Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610, 618–19 (1986); Care & Protection of Lillith, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 141–42 (2004).

25. Where a material change has occurred that may adversely affect the children’s safety, the Court is not required to wait until more serious harm occurs before acting; it may adopt reasonable, protective conditions to prevent further risk. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 225–26; Petelinsek v. Turner, 92 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 621–22 (2018).

### IV. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

26. The Father’s decision to reside with the Paramour—who has a criminal history involving assault and battery and a prior abuse-prevention order—and thereby to expose the children to that individual in his household represents a significant, unanticipated change in the children’s living environment during Father’s parenting time.

27. The reported yelling, door-slamming, and volatility in the home, together with the incident in which one child was grabbed with sufficient force to leave a mark, indicate that the Paramour’s presence and conduct have already had a direct and negative impact on the children.

28. The involvement of the police, as a result of a neighbor’s call during a loud argument in which the children were present, further demonstrates that Father’s household currently presents an unstable and potentially unsafe environment for the children.

29. In light of G.L. c. 208, § 31A and related case law, the presence of a person with a history of violence and a prior restraining order, combined with the above-described conduct, must be treated as highly relevant to the children’s best interests and to any determination regarding the conditions of Father’s parenting time.

30. Continuing the Existing Parenting Plan without modification would fail to adequately protect the children from foreseeable emotional harm and potential physical harm arising from ongoing exposure to the Paramour’s behavior and the volatility of Father’s home environment.

31. The modification sought by Mother is narrowly tailored to address the specific risk: Mother does not seek to eliminate Father’s relationship with the children, but rather seeks protective conditions—either (a) that the Paramour not be present during Father’s parenting time, or (b) alternatively, that Father’s parenting time be supervised—so as to protect the children while maintaining their relationship with Father.

32. Imposing conditions that limit the children’s exposure to a violent or volatile individual is consistent with the Probate and Family Court’s statutory mandate to act in the children’s best interests and its equitable authority to fashion appropriate orders. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; G.L. c. 215, § 6; Yannas, 395 Mass. at 710; Felton, 383 Mass. at 234–35.

33. Under the totality of the circumstances, there has been a material and substantial change since the entry of the 2021 Judgment, and modification of that judgment is necessary to protect the children’s safety and to serve their best interests.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law;

B. Find and rule that modification of the 2021 Judgment is in the best interests of the minor children, Liam and Ava;

C. Modify the 2021 Judgment to include the following orders, or substantially similar orders as the Court deems appropriate:

   1. That Father’s parenting time shall continue on such schedule as the Court finds to be in the children’s best interests, provided that the Paramour (the adult with a criminal record for assault and battery and a prior restraining order) shall not be present in the residence, vehicle, or any location at which the children are present during Father’s parenting time; and

   2. That Father shall not permit the Paramour to exercise any caretaking responsibilities for the children, to discipline the children physically, or to have unsupervised contact with the children at any time;  

   **OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,** if Father is unwilling or unable to comply with the above conditions:

   3. That Father’s parenting time be supervised by an appropriate third party or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, on such schedule and under such terms as the Court deems appropriate, until further order of the Court or until Father demonstrates that the children can safely be in his care without the presence of the Paramour;

D. Order that neither party shall expose the children to physical discipline, domestic violence, or verbal abuse in their presence, and that all third parties in the home during parenting time shall conduct themselves in a manner that safeguards the children’s emotional and physical well‑being;

E. Grant such temporary orders (including temporary restraining conditions relating to the Paramour’s contact with the children, if necessary) as may be appropriate pending a full hearing on the merits of this Complaint for Modification;

F. Award such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests, safety, and welfare of the minor children.
