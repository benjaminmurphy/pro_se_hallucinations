                       COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
                      (NEGligence – Personal Injury)

Plaintiff Jordan Smith (“Plaintiff”), for a Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, LLC (“Defendant”), states as follows:

                                     PARTIES

1.   Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an individual who, at all times relevant to this Complaint, resided at 123 Maple Street, Third Floor, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

2.   Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, LLC is, upon information and belief, a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

3.   At all relevant times, Defendant acted by and through its officers, managers, agents, employees, and/or contractors, who were acting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency.

                          JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4.   This is an action sounding in negligence arising out of personal injuries and property damage sustained by Plaintiff in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts.

5.   The amount of damages reasonably likely to be recovered is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A.

6.   Venue is proper in Lynn District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lynn, Massachusetts, and the subject premises are located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

                                FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7.   At all times relevant, Plaintiff leased and occupied a residential apartment unit on the third floor of the building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

8.   Defendant, as owner and/or manager of the Premises, had the responsibility and duty to maintain the common areas of the building, including the hallways and common-area smoke detection and fire safety systems, in a reasonably safe condition.

9.   A smoke detector was installed in the third-floor common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment unit door.

10.  For an extended period of time prior to September 15, 2023—on the order of months—the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment emitted intermittent “chirping” noises consistent with a low-battery warning.

11.  Eventually, an individual unknown to Plaintiff removed the battery from the smoke detector, apparently to silence the chirping, and left the removed battery on the windowsill in the third-floor hallway.

12.  After the battery was removed, the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was nonfunctional and incapable of providing audible alarm or early warning in the event of fire.

13.  Plaintiff personally observed that the smoke detector had no battery installed and that the loose battery sat on the hallway windowsill in plain view.

14.  Plaintiff notified Defendant, through its management and/or agents, about the nonfunctioning hallway smoke detector and missing battery on at least three separate occasions over the course of several months.

15.  On each such occasion, Defendant, through its representatives, acknowledged Plaintiff’s complaints and stated, in substance, that Defendant would “take care of it.”

16.  Despite these repeated notifications and assurances, Defendant failed to repair, replace, or otherwise restore the hallway smoke detector to working order prior to September 15, 2023.

17.  On or about the night of September 15, 2023, a fire originated in a first-floor apartment within the Premises, reportedly in the kitchen area.

18.  Because the third-floor hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment had no battery and was nonfunctional, it did not sound or provide any alarm or early warning of the developing fire and smoke conditions.

19.  Plaintiff did not receive any audible smoke detector warning in the third-floor hallway.

20.  Plaintiff first became aware that something was wrong only upon smelling smoke while inside the apartment.

21.  By the time Plaintiff opened the apartment door to investigate, smoke had already accumulated in the third-floor hallway and was thick enough to cause immediate difficulty in breathing and visibility.

22.  Plaintiff attempted to evacuate the Premises via the hallway and stairwell, encountering dense smoke that caused Plaintiff to cough, struggle to breathe, and become disoriented.

23.  Plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation while attempting to exit the building, including inhalation of hot, noxious, and particulate-laden smoke.

24.  Emergency responders, including fire department personnel and emergency medical services, arrived at the scene and transported Plaintiff for medical evaluation and treatment.

25.  Plaintiff was treated for smoke inhalation and related respiratory distress and remained in the hospital overnight for observation and care.

26.  As a direct and proximate result of the fire and the lack of prompt warning from a functioning hallway smoke detector, Plaintiff sustained bodily injury in the form of smoke inhalation, respiratory irritation, and associated physical and emotional distress.

27.  Plaintiff incurred approximately $12,000 in medical expenses for emergency care, hospital treatment, diagnostic testing, medications, and follow-up care.

28.  As a further direct and proximate result of the incident and resulting injuries, Plaintiff missed work and suffered lost wages of approximately $2,500.

29.  In addition, Plaintiff’s personal property located within the apartment—including furniture, clothing, electronics, and household items—was damaged or destroyed by smoke, soot, and water used in fighting the fire.

30.  Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, and difficulty breathing at times, along with anxiety and emotional distress related to the fire, the evacuation, and fear of future fires.

31.  At all times relevant, Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the nonfunctioning hallway smoke detector and the absence of a battery, because:

     a. The removed battery was plainly visible on the third-floor windowsill for an extended period of time;  
     b. The smoke detector had audibly chirped for months beforehand, signaling a low-battery condition; and  
     c. Plaintiff repeatedly reported the condition to Defendant and requested that it be fixed.

32.  Despite this actual and constructive notice, Defendant failed to repair or replace the missing battery, failed to test the detector, and failed to ensure that the common-area fire safety equipment was in proper working order.

33.  Defendant’s failure to remedy the defective smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit substantially increased the risk that occupants, including Plaintiff, would receive no early warning of a fire, thereby increasing the likelihood and severity of personal injury.

34.  Had the hallway smoke detector been properly maintained and functioning, Plaintiff would have received earlier warning of the fire, would have begun evacuation sooner, and would likely have avoided or significantly reduced the extent of smoke inhalation and associated injuries.

35.  Defendant’s acts and omissions, as described above, were a breach of its duty of care to Plaintiff and constituted negligence under Massachusetts law.

36.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain personal injuries, medical expenses, lost earnings, property damage, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other damages.

                             LIABILITY AND DUTY

37.  At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord and property manager, owed Plaintiff, a lawful residential tenant and invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, repair, and maintenance of the Premises, including the common areas and common-area smoke detectors, to keep them in reasonably safe condition. See G.L. c. 186, § 15F; Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).

38.  Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may be held liable in negligence for failing to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to tenants and their guests arising from dangerous conditions in common areas. See Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); Humphrey v. Byron, 447 Mass. 322 (2006).

39.  The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and applicable fire safety regulations require that residential landlords provide and maintain operational smoke detectors and fire warning systems in common areas for the protection of occupants. See, e.g., G.L. c. 148, §§ 26F, 26F½; 780 CMR (Massachusetts State Building Code) and 527 CMR (Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code) as applicable.

40.  Failure to comply with such statutory and regulatory requirements, where intended to protect tenants from fire-related harm, constitutes evidence of negligence. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355 (1990); Perry v. Medeiros, 369 Mass. 836 (1976).

41.  Defendant had actual notice of the defective hallway smoke detector and missing battery as a result of Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and the visible condition of the device and battery.

42.  At a minimum, Defendant had constructive notice of the defective condition because a reasonably careful landlord, exercising ordinary inspection and maintenance of common areas, would have discovered and remedied a nonfunctioning smoke detector with a battery visibly removed and left on a windowsill. See Lindsey v. Massios, 372 Mass. 79 (1977); Fiorentino v. Mason, 233 Mass. 451 (1919).

43.  Defendant’s failure to timely repair and maintain the hallway smoke detector, despite actual and/or constructive notice of its inoperable condition, constitutes a breach of its common-law duty of reasonable care and its statutory duty to maintain safe common areas. See Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); G.L. c. 186, § 15F.

44.  The risk that a fire might occur in a multi-unit residential building and that tenants could suffer smoke inhalation injuries if not warned promptly by a functioning smoke detector is plainly foreseeable to a reasonable landlord.

45.  Defendant’s negligence need not be the sole cause of Plaintiff’s injuries; it is sufficient that Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in producing Plaintiff’s harm. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983); Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251, 254 (1935).

46.  Defendant’s acts and omissions, as set forth herein, created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and were a legal and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

                                  COUNT I  
                               NEGLIGENCE  
                        (Against All Defendants)

47.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–46 as if fully set forth herein.

48.  Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, inspection, repair, and maintenance of the Premises, including the common-area hallway and smoke detection systems.

49.  Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty under Massachusetts law to comply with applicable statutes, codes, and regulations designed to protect tenants from fire hazards and to provide adequate and functional smoke detection in common areas. See G.L. c. 148, §§ 26F, 26F½; G.L. c. 186, § 15F; 780 CMR; 527 CMR.

50.  Defendant breached its duty of care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

     a. Failing to maintain the common-area hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit in a safe and operable condition;  
     b. Failing to replace the missing battery in the hallway smoke detector despite actual and/or constructive notice of its removal;  
     c. Failing to inspect, test, and monitor common-area smoke detectors at reasonable intervals;  
     d. Failing to respond reasonably and promptly to Plaintiff’s repeated complaints about the nonfunctioning hallway smoke detector;  
     e. Failing to comply with applicable fire and safety codes, including requirements for operational smoke detectors in common areas of residential buildings;  
     f. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other tenants of the known lack of a functioning hallway smoke detector; and  
     g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent landlord and property manager would act under the same or similar circumstances.

51.  The foregoing acts and omissions constitute negligence under Massachusetts common law governing landlord liability for dangerous conditions in common areas. See Young v. Garwacki, 380 Mass. 162 (1980); Humphrey v. Byron, 447 Mass. 322 (2006).

52.  Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries in that the absence of a functioning smoke detector delayed Plaintiff’s awareness of the fire, delayed Plaintiff’s evacuation, and significantly increased the extent of smoke exposure and resulting injuries.

53.  As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including smoke inhalation and respiratory distress, and suffered pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress.

54.  As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately $12,000, and will reasonably incur additional medical expenses into the future.

55.  As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff lost wages in the approximate amount of $2,500 and may suffer additional loss of earning capacity.

56.  As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered damage to personal property, including but not limited to smoke and water damage to furniture, clothing, electronics, and household goods, in an amount to be proven at trial.

57.  Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were within the scope of the risks that made Defendant’s conduct negligent, and such injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning common-area smoke detector.

58.  Plaintiff’s conduct was at all relevant times reasonable under the circumstances, and Plaintiff did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligence.

59.  To the extent Defendant contends that the negligence of any other person or entity contributed to Plaintiff’s injuries, Defendant remains liable under Massachusetts comparative negligence principles for its proportionate share of fault and responsibility. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Zeller v. Cantu, 395 Mass. 76 (1985).

60.  Plaintiff is entitled to recover full and fair compensation for all injuries and damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, damage to personal property, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and all other permissible damages under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776 (1975); Jones v. Wayland, 374 Mass. 249 (1978).

                                JURY DEMAND

61.  Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60 and applicable rules, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

                               PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Smith respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, LLC, and award the following relief:
