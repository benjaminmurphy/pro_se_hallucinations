  Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C; and related authority)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time Judgment/Order entered on September 15, 2018, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is an adult individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child the subject of this proceeding.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), is an adult individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The minor child of the parties is:  
   - Daniel Johnson, date of birth: [____], age 8 (the “Child”).

4. This Court issued the original custody and parenting time order in this matter on or about September 15, 2018, in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, docket number to be supplied by the Court.

5. The Child has resided in Massachusetts for more than six (6) months prior to the filing of this Complaint. Accordingly, this Court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over custody and parenting time pursuant to M.G.L. c. 209B and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, and it retains continuing jurisdiction over its prior custody order pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

6. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the prior order/judgment was entered here and the parties and Child reside in Middlesex County.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT/ORDER

7. On September 15, 2018, when the Child was approximately three (3) years old, this Court entered a Judgment/Order establishing custody and parenting time.

8. Under that existing order:

   a. Mother was granted primary physical custody of the Child; and  

   b. Father was granted three short visits during the week plus a Sunday afternoon visit each week, with no overnights, due in substantial part to his then-limited housing situation and lack of an appropriate space for the Child to sleep.

9. At the time the order was entered, Father was living in a rented room in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have a separate bedroom or suitable sleeping area for the Child, which was a substantial factor supporting the restriction to day-time, non‑overnight parenting time.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since the entry of the September 15, 2018 order, there has been a substantial and material change in the circumstances of the parties and the Child, such that the existing parenting-time schedule is no longer appropriate or in the Child’s best interests.

11. As of the date of this Complaint (December 1, 2025), the Child is eight (8) years old and is enrolled in school full‑time.

12. The Child’s increased age, developmental stage, and school obligations materially alter the circumstances that existed at the time of the prior order, when the Child was only three (3) years old and not in full‑time school. See, e.g., **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (changes in age and maturation of child may constitute material change warranting modification); **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (recognizing that modification may be appropriate as the needs of the child evolve over time).

13. Father’s living situation has materially improved since the entry of the prior order. Father now has his own apartment, where the Child has his own bedroom and appropriate accommodations for overnight visits.

14. The principal factual basis for the original “no overnight” restriction—Father’s lack of appropriate, stable child‑suitable housing—no longer exists. See **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (improvement in a parent’s living situation may constitute a material change justifying modification where it directly affects the child’s welfare); **Fugere v. Fugere**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 758 (1987) (change in a parent’s circumstances affecting suitability of housing and parenting ability can support modification).

15. Under the current schedule (three brief weekday visits and one Sunday afternoon, all without overnights), the Child is frequently shuttled back and forth between the parents’ homes on school nights, which:

   a. Disrupts the Child’s homework routine;  

   b. Interferes with consistent bedtimes and sleep hygiene; and  

   c. Is exhausting for the Child and unduly burdensome for both parents.

16. The existing schedule, designed for a pre‑school‑aged child, has become ill‑suited to the realities of an eight‑year‑old in full‑time school and is no longer in the Child’s best interests. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests standard is overarching consideration in custody-related determinations); **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (emphasizing need for stable, predictable arrangements that promote child’s welfare).

17. The Child has repeatedly expressed a desire to spend overnight parenting time with Father and has specifically requested “sleepovers” at Father’s residence, where he has his own bedroom.

18. The Child’s wish for overnight contact is age‑appropriate and, in the context of Father’s now‑suitable home, consistent with his emotional well‑being and sense of security. While a child’s preferences are not controlling, they are a relevant factor under Massachusetts law in assessing the Child’s best interests, especially as a child matures. See **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (child’s expressed preferences are one of multiple factors bearing on best interests); **Custody of Zia**, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).

19. Mother acknowledges the Child’s positive relationship with Father and recognizes that expanded and better‑structured parenting time, including overnights, is appropriate and beneficial at this stage of the Child’s life, provided that the schedule supports the Child’s school and developmental needs.

20. Both parents agree that the current schedule is no longer workable or age‑appropriate and that it should be modified to include overnight parenting time with Father and to reduce the number of short, disruptive visits occurring on school nights.

21. Continuation of the existing schedule—designed around Father’s former housing limitation and the Child’s pre‑school age—would unnecessarily disrupt the Child’s school routine and would fail to maximize the Child’s opportunity for stable, meaningful, and developmentally appropriate time with both parents.

22. The material changes in circumstances since the 2018 order include, but are not limited to:

   a. The Child’s increased age, maturity, and full‑time school enrollment;  

   b. Father’s significant improvement in housing, including a separate, appropriate bedroom for the Child;  

   c. The practical difficulties and strain caused by frequent, short weekday visits on school nights; and  

   d. The Child’s consistent requests for overnight parenting time with Father.

23. These changes were not anticipated at the time of the original order in the specific form they have developed, and their cumulative effect is substantial and material, warranting modification under Massachusetts law. See **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (modification requires material change in circumstances and that modification serves best interests of the child); **Cooper v. Cooper**, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 115 (2021) (material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the child is prerequisite to alteration of custody/parenting provisions).

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD

24. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, and by analogy M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, a Probate and Family Court may modify its previous judgments regarding custody and parenting time when a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child has occurred and a modification is necessary in the best interests of the child.

25. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that the moving party in a custody/parenting‑time modification must show: (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment; and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

26. In assessing the Child’s best interests, the Court considers the totality of the circumstances, including, without limitation, the Child’s age and developmental needs, the stability of each household, the relationship between the Child and each parent, the ability of each parent to meet the Child’s needs, and the necessity of a schedule that supports the Child’s education, health, and emotional stability. See **G. L. c. 208, § 31** (best interests factors in custody determinations); **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (best interests standard is flexible and fact‑specific).

27. The circumstances outlined above constitute a significant and continuing change affecting the Child’s welfare, thus meeting the threshold for modification, and the requested modification promotes the Child’s best interests by providing a developmentally appropriate, less disruptive, and more stable parenting schedule.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

28. Mother seeks a modification of the existing September 15, 2018 order solely as to physical custody/parenting time, not legal custody (unless otherwise ordered by the Court), to reflect the current reality of the Child’s life and Father’s improved circumstances.

29. Mother requests that the Court modify the parenting‑time provisions to:

   a. Maintain primary physical custody of the Child with Mother;  

   b. Establish a regular, predictable schedule of parenting time for Father that includes overnights appropriate to the Child’s age and school obligations;  

   c. Reduce or eliminate multiple short weekday exchanges on school nights, in favor of longer, more stable blocks of parenting time that minimize transportation burdens and disruption to homework and bedtime routines; and  

   d. Provide Father with reasonable holiday, vacation, and summer parenting time, consistent with the Child’s best interests.

30. By way of example only (and subject to the Court’s judgment and the parties’ further agreement or a court‑ordered parenting plan), Mother requests that the Court consider an order along the following lines:

   a. **Weekday/Weekend Schedule:**  

      i. Father shall have parenting time with the Child on alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m.) until Sunday at 6:00 p.m., with overnights at Father’s residence; and  

      ii. One midweek overnight on non‑consecutive school nights (for example, Wednesday after school until Thursday morning drop‑off at school), or such other midweek arrangement the Court finds to be in the Child’s best interests.

   b. **Holiday, Vacation, and Summer Time:**  

      i. The parties shall share major holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time on a reasonable, alternating schedule, either agreed to by the parties or set forth in a detailed parenting plan, while giving primary consideration to the Child’s best interests and continuity.  

      ii. School breaks and holidays that would otherwise fall on Mother’s weekend may be adjusted so that the Child has fair and meaningful time with Father during such periods, consistent with the Child’s needs.

31. Mother’s proposed modification is designed to:

   a. Better support the Child’s full‑time school schedule;  

   b. Provide the Child with age‑appropriate overnight contact with Father in a now‑suitable home environment;  

   c. Reduce the stress, fatigue, and logistical burden associated with frequent short visits on school nights; and  

   d. Preserve the Child’s primary residence with Mother while significantly enhancing Father’s meaningful, quality time with the Child.

32. The requested modification does not seek to diminish Father’s role in the Child’s life; on the contrary, it facilitates more consistent, less fragmented parenting time with Father in a manner compatible with the Child’s education and development.

33. The requested modification is consistent with Massachusetts statutes and caselaw emphasizing the child’s best interests, the importance of a stable and predictable schedule, and the Court’s broad equitable power to adjust parenting arrangements when circumstances materially change. See **M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31**; **M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20**; **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties and the Child since the entry of the September 15, 2018 custody and parenting‑time order;

B. Further find and rule that modification of the prior order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor Child, Daniel Johnson;

C. Modify the September 15, 2018 Judgment/Order to:

   1. Maintain primary physical custody of the Child with Mother;  

   2. Grant Father expanded and structured parenting time including regular overnight parenting time at Father’s residence, on a schedule consistent with the Child’s school and developmental needs;  

   3. Reduce the number of short, disruptive weekday visits occurring on school nights and replace them with longer, more stable blocks of parenting time; and  

   4. Establish an equitable schedule for holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time, either by approving a written parenting plan submitted by the parties or by entering such schedule as the Court deems just and appropriate;

D. Issue such temporary orders as may be necessary pending final hearing, if requested and deemed appropriate by the Court;

E. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the circumstances to protect and promote the best interests of the minor Child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA TAYLOR
