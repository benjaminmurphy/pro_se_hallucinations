COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time / Visitation Conditions)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Liam Smith.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in or near Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Liam Smith.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, Liam Smith, date of birth: __________, age 9 (“the Child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This matter is properly before the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable), and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting-time orders concerning the minor child.

5. Venue is proper in this Court because the existing custody and parenting-time order was entered by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, and the minor child resides within this Court’s jurisdiction.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / EXISTING ORDER

6. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (“Existing Order”) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child.

7. Under the Existing Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Child. The Child’s primary residence is with Mother, and the Child has parenting time with Father on certain weekends, including overnights, as specified in the Existing Order.

8. At the time of the Existing Order, the Court determined that both parents were stable, appropriate caregivers, and that shared legal custody and the existing overnight parenting-time schedule were in the Child’s best interests, based on the circumstances then existing.

### IV. STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

9. A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time judgment where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment and where modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; see also Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

10. Massachusetts courts have long held that the “paramount concern” in custody and parenting-time matters is the best interests of the child. See Custody of Kale, 409 Mass. 844, 848 (1991); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

11. To justify modification, the moving party must demonstrate (1) a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child since the prior order, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–39 (1996).

12. The Court has broad equitable powers to fashion appropriate parenting-time conditions, including supervised parenting time, restrictions on overnights, and other safeguards to protect the child’s safety and welfare. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); Custody of a Minor, 378 Mass. 712 (1979); G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10.

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

13. Since the entry of the Existing Order on September 15, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Child’s safety and well-being during Father’s parenting time.

14. The Existing Order was premised on the belief that both parents were sufficiently stable and that they could co‑parent without significant conflict or safety concerns, including during Father’s overnight parenting time.

15. In the past several months, Mother has observed and learned of circumstances that raise serious concerns that Father is abusing alcohol and/or other substances during his parenting time, particularly during evening and overnight periods when the Child is in his care.

16. The Child has reported to Mother that there are “special drinks” at Father’s residence and that at times Father “can’t walk straight.” The Child’s spontaneous and repeated statements, made in non‑litigious contexts, are consistent with observable signs of impairment and raise substantial concerns about substance use in the Child’s presence.

17. A neighbor who is familiar with the parties’ situation recently recorded a video showing Father stumbling and appearing unsteady while getting the Child out of a car late at night. This video was sent to Mother and is consistent with the Child’s descriptions of Father’s behavior.

18. The timing of the incident captured on video corresponds to times when the Child is returning from outings or activities with Father, suggesting that Father may be impaired while transporting or supervising the Child.

19. The Child’s school has communicated to Mother that the Child regularly appears extremely tired and exhausted on Monday mornings, following weekends spent in Father’s care. This pattern did not exist at the time of the Existing Order and is a new, consistent concern reported by school personnel.

20. Mother's observations of the Child upon returning from Father’s overnights include unusual fatigue, irritability, and statements suggesting late bedtimes and a lack of consistent supervision during Father’s parenting time.

21. These developments—reports of Father’s apparent intoxication, objective video evidence of stumbling and impaired gait, and school‑reported Monday fatigue following Father’s weekends—constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances not contemplated by the Court at the time of the Existing Order.

22. The Child is now older (age 9) and better able to verbalize his experiences, including his discomfort and observations regarding Father’s behavior and the environment at Father’s home. See generally Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003) (recognizing children’s evolving needs and circumstances over time as relevant to best‑interest analysis).

23. The pattern of concerning behavior suggests that Father may be using alcohol and/or other substances in a manner that compromises his ability to safely supervise the Child, particularly during evenings, overnights, and times when he is responsible for transportation.

24. The presence of suspected substance abuse during parenting time, especially in conjunction with operating a motor vehicle and caring for a young child, fundamentally alters the risk profile associated with the current overnight parenting-time schedule and renders the Existing Order unsafe and contrary to the Child’s best interests.

25. Massachusetts courts have recognized that evidence of substance abuse or impaired parenting abilities may warrant modification of custody or parenting time to protect a child’s welfare. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Care & Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704, 711–13 (1984); Adoption of Quentin, 424 Mass. 882, 886–87 (1997).

26. The changed circumstances outlined above were not known to, and could not reasonably have been fully appreciated by, Mother or the Court at the time of the Existing Order, and they arose after that judgment was entered.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

27. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, the Court must determine custody and parenting time in accordance with the Child’s best interests, taking into account, inter alia, the Child’s safety, emotional well-being, stability, and the capacity of each parent to meet the Child’s needs. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44.

28. The Child’s best interests are not served by a parenting-time arrangement that exposes him to an impaired caregiver who may be under the influence of alcohol or other substances, particularly during nighttime hours when the Child is most dependent upon the supervising adult.

29. The Child’s reported exhaustion and school difficulties on Mondays indicate that the current weekend overnight schedule is negatively affecting his rest and school readiness, thereby undermining his educational and developmental needs.

30. Ensuring adequate sleep, predictable routines, and a safe, sober environment is central to the Child’s best interests and well‑being. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840‑44 (emphasizing stability and the child’s overall welfare).

31. The Court is empowered to impose reasonable conditions on parenting time to safeguard the Child while preserving, to the extent safely possible, the Child’s relationship with both parents. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. at 234–36; G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10.

32. Supervised parenting time, or parenting time subject to clearly defined conditions related to substance use and overnight care, is a less restrictive alternative than termination of contact and would appropriately balance Father’s interest in maintaining a relationship with the Child against the Child’s paramount need for safety and stability.

33. Given the evidence suggesting that the risk to the Child is heightened during evenings and overnights, it is in the Child’s best interests to modify the Existing Order to (a) eliminate or limit overnights with Father unless and until safety can be assured, and/or (b) require supervision or specific sobriety‑related conditions for Father’s parenting time.

34. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the identified risk (suspected substance use and resulting impairment) while allowing Father continued access to the Child under conditions that prioritize the Child’s safety and well-being.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

35. Mother does not seek to terminate Father’s relationship with the Child; rather, she seeks a modification of the Existing Order to ensure that Father’s parenting time occurs under safe and appropriate conditions.

36. Mother respectfully requests that this Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the September 15, 2021 order, and that modification is necessary to serve the Child’s best interests, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the cases cited above, including Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); and Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

37. Specifically, Mother requests that this Court:

   a. Modify the Existing Order to require that all of Father’s parenting time with the Child be supervised by a neutral, responsible adult or through a professionally supervised visitation center approved by the Court, at least on a temporary basis pending further review and evaluation; and/or

   b. In the alternative, modify the Existing Order to suspend or significantly limit Father’s overnight parenting time, permitting only daytime parenting time subject to conditions designed to ensure the Child’s safety, such as:
   
   - A requirement that Father not consume any alcohol or non‑prescribed controlled substances for a specified period (e.g., 24 hours) before and during his parenting time;  
   - A prohibition on Father operating a motor vehicle with the Child in the car if Father has consumed alcohol or any impairing substance;  
   - Any additional monitoring, testing, or safeguards the Court deems appropriate.

   c. Maintain primary physical custody with Mother, with joint or sole legal custody to be revisited as the Court deems appropriate in light of Father’s ability to make safe and sound decisions for the Child.

   d. Order that the parties comply with all recommendations of any Guardian ad Litem, probation, or other investigative or evaluative services that the Court may appoint to assess the Child’s safety and best interests.

   e. Enter any temporary orders as necessary under G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and related authority) to protect the Child during the pendency of this Complaint for Modification.

   f. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the Child’s welfare, including but not limited to specific conditions regarding substance use, transportation, and overnights.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the September 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time order;

2. Find that modification of the Existing Order is required to serve the best interests of the minor child, Liam Smith, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including but not limited to Custody of Vaughn, Custody of Kali, Hunter v. Rose, Smith v. McDonald, and Felton v. Felton;

3. Modify the Existing Order to require supervised parenting time for Father and/or impose appropriate conditions and limitations on Father’s parenting time, particularly with respect to evening and overnight periods, substance use, and transportation safety;

4. Maintain the Child’s primary physical residence with Mother, Emily Johnson;

5. Enter such temporary orders as are necessary to protect the Child’s immediate safety and well‑being during the pendency of this Complaint for Modification;

6. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
EMILY JOHNSON,
