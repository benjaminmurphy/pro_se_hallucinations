JESSICA LANE,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK LANE,  
  Defendant.  

---------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
---------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Lane (“Mother”), is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Sophia Lane (date of birth and full address omitted here for privacy).

2. The Defendant, Mark Lane (“Father”), is an individual residing on Cape Cod, in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Mother and the child’s school.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, to wit:  
   - Sophia Lane, age 8 (“the Child”).

4. On or about May 15, 2019, the Barnstable Probate and Family Court (the “Court”) entered a Judgment (or Order) regarding legal and physical custody and parenting time (the “2019 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2019 Judgment, the Mother was granted primary physical custody of the Child. The Father was granted parenting time every other weekend, plus one midweek overnight on Wednesdays, with the expectation and understanding that the parents lived in the same town and that the Child’s commute to school the following morning would be a brief, local trip.

6. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 (as applicable to custody and parenting time), G.L. c. 209, and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the general equity powers of the Probate and Family Court. See, e.g., Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

7. Venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court because the prior Judgment was entered in this Court and the Father resides within this county. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 208, § 6.

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances relating to the Child’s living, schooling, and transportation arrangements, which materially affects her welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 544–45 (2010); Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 293–94 (2009).

9. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, both parents resided in the same town, close to the Child’s elementary school. The Wednesday overnight with Father involved only a very short drive (approximately five minutes) from Father’s home to the Child’s school on Thursday mornings.

10. Subsequent to the 2019 Judgment, the Father relocated his residence to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles away from the Child’s school and the Mother’s residence.

11. Despite this substantial increase in distance and travel time, the Father has continued to insist on exercising the Wednesday midweek overnight on the same terms as when the parties resided in close proximity.

12. On Wednesdays, the Father now typically picks the Child up from school, drives her approximately ninety (90) miles to his Cape Cod residence, has her sleep there, and then wakes the Child at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings to drive her back approximately ninety (90) miles to her school.

13. This schedule requires a young child in second/third grade to engage in extensive, early-morning interstate travel on a school day, significantly reducing her nightly sleep and causing regular fatigue.

14. The Child has become consistently exhausted on Thursdays, and, upon information and belief, this has been observed and reported by her teacher and/or school staff, including a noticeable drop in her participation and attentiveness in class on Thursdays.

15. The current midweek overnight arrangement—given the Father’s relocation and the resulting length of the commute—was not and could not reasonably have been contemplated at the time of the 2019 Judgment, when both parties resided within minutes of the Child’s school. See, e.g., Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 370–72 (1981) (material change based on circumstances not contemplated at time of prior judgment).

16. The Father’s unilateral change of residence, combined with his insistence on maintaining the same midweek overnight structure, constitutes a material change in circumstances that directly affects the Child’s best interests, school performance, health, and welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996).

17. The Child’s need for adequate, consistent sleep on school nights, reasonable commuting time, and stability in her educational environment are central to her best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003) (best interests standard includes stability, continuity, and child’s emotional and academic needs); Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243–44 (2000).

18. The extended round-trip driving on the midweek overnight, the extremely early wake-up time, and the associated fatigue are detrimental to the Child’s welfare and contrary to her best interests. G.L. c. 208, § 31 (requiring the Court to consider the best interests of the child in custody determinations); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–06 (1981).

19. These circumstances are materially different from those that existed when the 2019 Judgment was entered, and they justify a modification of the parenting time schedule to eliminate the midweek overnight and adjust the weekend schedule in a manner that fosters the Child’s relationship with Father while protecting her educational and physical well-being. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262–63 (2001); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981).

20. The proposed modification is limited, targeted, and directly responsive to the material change in circumstances: it does not seek to alter the award of primary physical custody to Mother or to eliminate Father’s substantial parenting time; instead, it aims to restructure parenting time to avoid excessively burdensome school-night travel while preserving regular and meaningful contact with Father. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710–11 (1985) (emphasizing maintenance of strong parent-child relationships consistent with child’s best interests).

21. Mother is not seeking this modification to interfere with Father’s relationship with the Child, but rather to protect the Child’s health, sleep, school performance, and overall best interests in light of the Father’s relocation and the burdensome travel now required by the existing midweek overnight schedule.

### III. APPLICABLE LAW

22. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may modify an existing custody or parenting time order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See also Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 544–45 (2010); Pierce v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 293–94 (2009).

23. The “best interests of the child” is the paramount consideration in all custody and parenting time decisions, including modifications. G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 840–41; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

24. A material change in a parent’s residence and the consequential effect on a child’s schedule, schooling, and well-being can constitute a material and substantial change sufficient to warrant modification. See Schuler, 382 Mass. at 370–72; Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871–72 (2006).

25. Where an existing parenting plan, as applied to new circumstances, causes excessive travel, disrupted sleep, or diminished school performance for a young child, the Court has both the authority and the responsibility to adjust that plan to better serve the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 243–44; Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–06.

26. The requested modification in this matter is consistent with the guiding principles set forth in the above authorities and seeks to tailor the existing order to the Child’s current needs while preserving Father’s role in her life.

### IV. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2019 Judgment, specifically including, but not limited to:

   1. Father’s relocation to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles from the Child’s school, after entry of the 2019 Judgment; and  

   2. The resulting excessively early wake-up times, lengthy midweek travel, fatigue, and negative impact on the Child’s school participation on Thursdays.

B. Find that it is in the best interests of the minor Child, Sophia Lane, that the current midweek Wednesday overnight with Father be eliminated during the school year (and, if the Court deems appropriate, during the entire year), in light of the travel distance and its impact on the Child’s rest and school performance.

C. Modify the 2019 Judgment to:

   1. Eliminate Father’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time;  

   2. Provide that, in the Court’s discretion, Father may have a reasonable midweek dinner visit (non-overnight), to occur locally near the Child’s residence or school, ending at a reasonable hour so as not to interfere with the Child’s sleep and school responsibilities; and  

   3. Adjust Father’s weekend parenting time, if necessary, to preserve substantial and meaningful contact with the Child—such as clarifying that Father shall continue to have parenting time on alternate weekends from Friday after school (or a specified time) through Sunday at a specified return time, or as otherwise ordered by the Court consistent with the Child’s best interests.

D. Order that all exchanges, including weekend transitions and any midweek non-overnight visits, be structured to minimize the Child’s total travel time, especially on school days, and to promote her stability, rest, and educational success.

E. Confirm that Mother retains primary physical custody of the Child and that legal custody shall remain as previously ordered, except as otherwise expressly modified by the Court pursuant to this Complaint.

F. Order that each party shall comply with all other provisions of the existing Judgment(s) not modified by the Court’s new order.

G. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests of the minor Child.

Respectfully submitted,

JESSICA LANE,
