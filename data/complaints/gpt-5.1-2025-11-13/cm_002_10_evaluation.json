It does not articulate a general standard listing emotional, physical, and developmental needs, the parent\u2013child relationship, educational stability, and the practical impact of parenting arrangements as factors. The case is focused on requiring explicit findings about domestic violence rather than setting out a comprehensive best\u2011interests test, so it only partially and implicitly touches on some of the factors in the claimed proposition.",

Although the boy was described in testimony as \u2018a really bright student,\u2019 we note that the preference of an eleven-year-old is not given decisive weight, although it is a factor to be considered. ... It is well documented that witnessing domestic violence, as well as being one of its victims, has a profound impact on children. There are significant reported psychological problems in children who witness domestic violence, especially during important developmental stages.\""
