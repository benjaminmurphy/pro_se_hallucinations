**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Maria Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Johnson”) alleges as follows against Defendant Robert Smith (“Defendant” or “Mr. Smith”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maria Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant Robert Smith is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns and/or controls the residential rental property located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”), and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for providing and maintaining essential services to Plaintiff’s apartment at the Premises, including hot water, in compliance with Massachusetts law and applicable state sanitary and building codes.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, as this is a civil action seeking money damages within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Brockton Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, because the Premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the claims arose in this county.

6. This action arises under the Massachusetts landlord–tenant statutes and common law, including, but not limited to, G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment), as applied by Massachusetts appellate decisions.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts (the “Apartment” or “Unit”).

8. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Apartment as her primary residence from January 1, 2022 to the present.

9. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,450.00 to Defendant for the Apartment.

10. Under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the implied warranty of habitability recognized in *Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), residential landlords must provide essential services and maintain the premises in a habitable condition throughout the tenancy.

11. The provision of “hot water” is an essential service required by the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190, and the State Building Code, and constitutes a basic component of a habitable dwelling recognized under Massachusetts law. See *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–200.

12. On or about early November 2025 (approximately three weeks before December 1, 2025), the hot water in Plaintiff’s Apartment stopped functioning.

13. Plaintiff discovered that no hot water was available for bathing, showering, and washing dishes in the Apartment, effectively depriving her of a basic and essential service.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the loss of hot water on the same day she discovered the problem, via text message and/or other communication.

15. Defendant responded that the water heater allegedly needed a replacement part and that he had ordered such part.

16. After approximately one week without hot water, Plaintiff again contacted Defendant, informing him that hot water service had not been restored.

17. Defendant stated that the needed part was “backordered” but did not provide Plaintiff with a definite timetable for repair or any alternative hot water arrangements.

18. After approximately two weeks without hot water, Plaintiff again contacted Defendant, and Defendant repeated that the part was backordered and that he was “working on it.”

19. As of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without hot water in her Apartment for approximately three weeks.

20. During this three‑week period, Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers or make other arrangements for bathing and washing, causing substantial inconvenience, discomfort, and interference with the normal and reasonable use of her home.

21. Plaintiff has had to travel to a gym to shower, incurring out-of-pocket costs of approximately $30 per month for a gym membership plus additional gasoline and travel expenses.

22. Plaintiff has also been compelled to take her infant child to her mother’s residence for baths because it is unsafe and unreasonable to bathe a baby in cold water, and boiling water in pots for bathing an infant presents obvious dangers.

23. Plaintiff has had to boil water on the stove to wash dishes, which is time‑consuming, inconvenient, and significantly interferes with her peaceful and comfortable enjoyment of the Apartment.

24. The conditions described above—prolonged loss of hot water—constitute a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

25. Despite having notice of the lack of hot water for approximately three weeks, Defendant has failed to restore hot water or to provide any reasonable interim accommodations (such as access to another unit for showers, a temporary heater, hotel arrangements, or alternative facilities).

26. Defendant’s failure to timely restore hot water is not justified by his claim that a part is “backordered,” as Massachusetts law does not excuse a landlord’s statutory obligations based on supplier delays when an essential service such as hot water is unavailable for an extended period. See *McKenna v. Begin*, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977) (landlord liable for code violations interfering with quiet enjoyment notwithstanding efforts to repair).

27. Defendant has the ability and obligation, as the property owner and landlord, to ensure prompt provision of essential services, including by arranging for alternative repairs, replacement of the entire hot water heater if necessary, or temporary measures to ensure hot water is available to Plaintiff.

28. Defendant’s failure, over a period of approximately three weeks, to correct the loss of hot water, despite repeated notice from Plaintiff, constitutes a failure or refusal to apply reasonably prompt, diligent, and effective remedial measures.

29. As a direct and proximate result of the lack of hot water and Defendant’s failure to correct the condition, Plaintiff has been deprived of the use and enjoyment of her Apartment in a manner that is “serious and substantial,” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and controlling case law.

30. Plaintiff has experienced significant discomfort, inconvenience, disruption of daily life, and interference with the normal and expected use of her home, including but not limited to bathing, caring for her infant child, and maintaining household cleanliness.

31. Plaintiff has also incurred monetary expenses and losses, including gym membership fees, increased transportation costs, and the functional loss of a portion of the value of her tenancy for the period during which she lacked hot water.

32. Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has suffered at least $500.00 in damages arising from Defendant’s conduct, including loss of use and enjoyment, out‑of‑pocket expenses, and related harms.

33. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has acted reasonably and has remained current in her rent obligations, paying $1,450 per month for a habitable apartment with essential services, including hot water.

34. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, even if Defendant has communicated with Plaintiff and has claimed to be “working on” the repairs, because the statute is violated when there is a serious interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment by acts or omissions of the landlord or those acting under his control. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977).

35. The absence of hot water for such a prolonged period, in violation of the State Sanitary Code, constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment even in the absence of willful harassment, because a substantial code violation that persists after notice and is attributable to the landlord’s failure to correct it supports liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Young v. Patrick*, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945–46 (1991); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 982–83 (1982).

36. Plaintiff therefore brings this action purely for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any landlord or person acting on his behalf who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.

39. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that a tenant’s covenant of quiet enjoyment protects the tenant’s right to freedom from serious and substantial interference with the tenancy caused by the landlord or by others whose conduct the landlord has a legal obligation to control. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977); *Gomes v. Fair*, 738 F.3d 509, 514–16 (1st Cir. 2013) (applying Massachusetts law).

40. A landlord’s failure to remedy substantial violations of the State Sanitary Code or to provide essential services after notice can constitute a constructive eviction or a breach of quiet enjoyment. See *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973); *Doe v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 404 Mass. 610, 617–18 (1989); *McKenna v. Begin*, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308–09 (1977).

41. The loss of hot water for over three weeks is a substantial violation of the State Sanitary Code and Building Code and an essential service failure that significantly interferes with the habitability of the Apartment.

42. Defendant knew or should have known of the serious nature of this condition, as Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant that she had no hot water and could not adequately bathe, wash, or care for her household.

43. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant failed to take reasonably prompt and effective action to restore hot water or to provide alternative arrangements to ensure the availability of hot water to Plaintiff.

44. Defendant’s omissions, including his failure to promptly repair or replace the water heater or to otherwise restore hot water, constitute an “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 982–83 (1982) (repeated floods and failure to repair plumbing supported quiet enjoyment claim); *Young v. Patrick*, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945–46 (1991) (landlord’s failure to remedy code violations actionable under § 14).

45. Under *Blackett*, 371 Mass. at 718–19, a landlord is liable for substantial interferences with quiet enjoyment that are the “natural and probable consequence” of acts or omissions under his control, even if he does not specifically intend the interference.

46. Under *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–200, a landlord’s failure to provide basic services and to comply with the State Sanitary Code may render the premises uninhabitable and may support claims under both the implied warranty of habitability and G.L. c. 186, § 14.

47. The deprivation of hot water for bathing and washing for a continuous period of approximately three weeks constitutes the type of substantial interference with a tenant’s ability to live in the apartment in a normal, safe, and sanitary manner that § 14 is intended to prevent.

48. Courts applying § 14 have recognized that when code violations or serious service failures persist over time, even absent overt harassment, tenants are entitled to statutory damages. See, e.g., *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908–09 (1987) (failure to maintain premises and correct code violations); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979) (landlord liable for code violations and interference with tenant’s rights); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–49 (2005) (affirming damages and fees under § 14).

49. Furthermore, under G.L. c. 239, § 8A, and related case law, serious and continuing code violations and failures to provide essential services are recognized as interfering with tenants’ rights to a safe and habitable dwelling, reflecting public policy that landlords bear primary responsibility for habitability. See *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 199–201; *Berman & Sons*, 379 Mass. at 199–201.

50. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water for approximately three weeks, despite notice, is unreasonable, negligent at minimum, and in violation of his statutory duties.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of the use and enjoyment of a habitable apartment with hot water for approximately three weeks;

   b. Physical discomfort, inconvenience, and disruption of daily living, including having to shower at a gym and travel elsewhere to bathe her infant child;

   c. Out-of-pocket expenses for a gym membership used primarily for showering, additional gas and transportation costs, and other expenses related to the lack of hot water; and

   d. Emotional distress, annoyance, and frustration associated with being unable to bathe normally or care for her child at home for an extended period.

52. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord who breaches the tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for either (1) actual and consequential damages or (2) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

53. Three months’ rent for Plaintiff’s Apartment at $1,450 per month equals $4,350.00, which is greater than Plaintiff’s current estimate of $500.00 in actual and consequential damages.

54. Plaintiff, as a pro se litigant, is not presently seeking an award of attorney’s fees for herself, but notes that G.L. c. 186, § 14 authorizes an award of reasonable attorney’s fees if counsel later appears on her behalf.

55. Plaintiff is therefore entitled under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the above-cited case law to recover at least three months’ rent ($4,350.00) as statutory damages, or her actual and consequential damages if greater, together with her taxable costs of this action and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Robert Smith, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by failing to provide hot water and by allowing a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment to persist for approximately three weeks;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than three months’ rent, calculated at $1,450 per month, for a total of at least $4,350.00, or such greater amount as the evidence at trial may show for Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater;

C. An award of Plaintiff’s taxable costs of suit as permitted by law;

D. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 if Plaintiff later obtains counsel;

E. Such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.
