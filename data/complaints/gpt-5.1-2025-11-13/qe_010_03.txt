    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Turner”) brings this Complaint against Defendant Linda Martinez (“Defendant” or “Ms. Martinez”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Linda Martinez is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 1 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

6. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A because the Premises are located in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the causes of action arose within this court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (the “Tenancy”).

8. Plaintiff has resided continuously at the Premises from June 1, 2022, through the present.

9. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($1,300.00) to Defendant.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant retained responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the Premises and for compliance with all applicable health, safety, building, and sanitary codes.

11. The bathroom in Plaintiff’s unit contains an exhaust fan but no exterior window.

12. Beginning in or about 2025 (on a more particular date unknown to Plaintiff at this time), mold growth appeared in the corner of the shower in Plaintiff’s bathroom.

13. Over time, the mold spread from the corner of the shower to additional portions of the shower area and then to the ceiling of the bathroom.

14. The mold was plainly visible and emitted a musty odor.

15. Plaintiff regularly used the bathroom exhaust fan when showering, although she may not have run it during every single shower.

16. Plaintiff took normal, ordinary hot showers consistent with typical residential use; her showering habits were not abnormal, excessive, or unforeseeable for a residential tenant.

17. After noticing the mold, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold condition in the bathroom.

18. Defendant came to the Premises, inspected the bathroom, and observed the mold condition.

19. Instead of arranging for proper remediation and repairs, Defendant blamed Plaintiff for the mold growth, asserting that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan “enough” and that Plaintiff’s showers were “too hot and too long.”

20. Defendant refused to take appropriate corrective action to address the underlying moisture and ventilation issues in the bathroom.

21. Defendant stated that she would merely clean the existing visible mold but would not improve or repair the ventilation or otherwise remedy the underlying conditions that caused or allowed the mold to develop and persist.

22. Plaintiff’s bathroom has no window and relies entirely on the exhaust fan for ventilation, a condition that is within the control of Defendant as the owner and landlord.

23. After the mold appeared and spread in the bathroom, Plaintiff began experiencing new respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which she had not experienced before the mold condition.

24. Plaintiff sought medical attention for these symptoms.

25. Plaintiff’s medical provider informed Plaintiff that the symptoms were likely related to or aggravated by the mold exposure in her bathroom and advised Plaintiff that the mold should be remediated.

26. The mold also spread onto and damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including her shower curtain and several towels.

27. Plaintiff was forced to discard and replace her shower curtain and towels due to mold contamination, incurring out-of-pocket property loss of approximately Sixty Dollars ($60.00).

28. Despite having notice of the mold condition, Defendant has failed and refused to take all reasonable steps required to abate the mold and to correct the underlying defects in the bathroom’s ventilation or other contributing building conditions.

29. Defendant’s response has been limited, inadequate, and focused on blaming Plaintiff for ordinary use of the bathroom, rather than making repairs or corrections under Defendant’s control and responsibility.

30. The mold condition and Defendant’s failure to adequately remediate it have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, particularly of the bathroom, which is an essential part of a habitable dwelling.

31. Plaintiff, who must use the bathroom daily, has been forced to endure visible mold, musty odors, and health concerns each time she uses the shower.

32. Plaintiff has suffered physical discomfort, respiratory symptoms, inconvenience, anxiety, and distress as a result of the mold condition and Defendant’s failure to remedy it.

33. Plaintiff’s doctor has recommended that the mold be removed, but Defendant has refused to undertake appropriate action to prevent recurrence or to address the underlying cause; as a result, Plaintiff continues to live with a risk of ongoing or recurrent mold exposure.

34. Based on the loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises and related impacts on her health and property, Plaintiff estimates she has sustained at least Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) in damages as of the filing of this Complaint, exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, and costs.

35. To the extent necessary, Plaintiff will amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence of additional damages revealed in discovery or trial.

### IV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

36. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes, as a matter of statute and common law, a covenant of quiet enjoyment, protecting a tenant’s right to peaceful, safe, and habitable use of the leased premises. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

37. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in pertinent part, that a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by a tenant is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

38. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in compliance with applicable building, housing, and sanitary codes, where such failures materially impair the character and value of the leased premises, may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

39. Under G.L. c. 111, § 127A and the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., residential dwellings must be maintained in a condition that is safe, clean, sanitary, and fit for human habitation, free from chronic dampness and related conditions that encourage mold or fungal growth.

40. Section 410.750 of the State Sanitary Code authorizes enforcement of these standards and recognizes that violations may render the dwelling unfit for human habitation; serious or repeated violations are evidence of material impairment of the tenant’s use of the premises.

41. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that statutory and regulatory violations that interfere with a tenant’s health or safety can constitute an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

42. A landlord can be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for conditions that, although not created intentionally to harm the tenant, result from the landlord’s failure to take reasonable steps necessary to correct known defects or code violations that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

43. The implied warranty of habitability, while distinct from the covenant of quiet enjoyment, supports and informs the determination that serious sanitary code violations and unremediated conditions affecting health, such as mold, constitute a substantial interference with the tenant’s occupancy. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771 (1994).

44. In cases of environmental or health-affecting conditions such as mold, improper ventilation, chronic dampness, or similar issues, courts have found that a landlord’s failure to repair after notice can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment and warrant recovery of rent abatement and consequential damages. See, e.g., Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390 (1982).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

45. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–44 as if fully set forth herein.

46. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful residential tenant of the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, paying rent to Defendant.

47. By statute and at common law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a covenant of quiet enjoyment of the Premises, including the right to occupy a habitable dwelling unit free from serious sanitary violations and conditions that materially interfere with normal residential use. G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

48. Defendant received actual notice of the mold condition in Plaintiff’s bathroom when Plaintiff reported and showed the visible mold to Defendant.

49. Defendant had the ability and obligation to correct the underlying conditions causing or permitting mold growth, including, but not limited to, moisture control, ventilation adequacy, and repair or replacement of equipment or structural components under Defendant’s control.

50. Despite such notice and obligation, Defendant failed and refused to take necessary and reasonable steps to abate the mold condition and to correct the underlying causes, choosing instead to blame Plaintiff’s ordinary, foreseeable use of the bathroom.

51. Defendant’s failure to remediate the mold and to address underlying ventilation or moisture problems caused or contributed to a continuing, unhealthy condition in the bathroom.

52. The presence of mold in an area of the home used daily, such as a bathroom, and the ongoing risk of mold recurrence substantially and materially impaired Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

53. Plaintiff experienced respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which her medical provider associated with the mold exposure, causing physical discomfort and anxiety about her health and safety in her own home.

54. Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property, including her shower curtain and towels, due to mold contamination, thereby sustaining consequential property damage.

55. The continuing presence and risk of mold, the unpleasant odors, the physical discomfort, the health concerns, and the necessity of using a bathroom that Plaintiff reasonably believed to be unsafe constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

56. Defendant’s actions and omissions, after having actual notice of the condition, constitute a direct or indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

57. Defendant’s failure to provide a bathroom free from chronic dampness and mold is inconsistent with the State Sanitary Code’s requirements for safe and sanitary housing, and such violations are evidence of a material impairment of the character and value of the leased premises. G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

58. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, damages including, but not limited to:  
   a. Diminution in the rental value of the Premises;  
   b. Out-of-pocket property loss of at least Sixty Dollars ($60.00);  
   c. Physical discomfort and respiratory symptoms;  
   d. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

59. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees (notwithstanding that Plaintiff is self-represented at this time), plus interest.

---

### VI. DAMAGES

60. Plaintiff presently estimates her actual damages, exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, costs, and fees, at not less than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), including, but not limited to:  
   a. Out-of-pocket replacement of mold-damaged personal property (~$60.00); and  
   b. Additional damages for loss of use and enjoyment, discomfort, and health-related impacts.

61. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover a statutory minimum of three months’ rent or her actual damages, whichever is greater. Based on monthly rent of $1,300.00, three months’ rent equals $3,900.00.

62. Plaintiff therefore seeks an award under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than Three Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($3,900.00), or such greater amount as the Court finds proper based on the evidence of actual and consequential damages at trial.

63. Plaintiff further seeks statutory interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and G.L. c. 261, and such reasonable attorneys’ fees as may become applicable if Plaintiff later retains counsel, as allowed under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Linda Martinez, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by failing to adequately remediate mold and the underlying conditions in Plaintiff’s bathroom after notice;

B. An award of damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than the greater of (a) Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages proved at trial, or (b) three months’ rent (currently $3,900.00), together with statutory interest;

C. Reimbursement for Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket property losses associated with mold damage to her personal property;

D. An award of costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E. An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel or as otherwise allowed by law;

F. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just, proper, and necessary to fully compensate Plaintiff and to remedy the interference with her quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

---

### VIII. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.
