v.  

BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER,  
    Defendant.  

_____________________________________/

                     COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
                 AND DEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY


Plaintiff Jason Smith (“Plaintiff”), as parent and next friend of his minor son, J.S., for his Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “BCC”), states as follows:

                              I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jason Smith is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father and lawful guardian of his minor son, J.S., who was eight (8) years old on September 15, 2023.

2. At all relevant times, Plaintiff’s son, J.S., was enrolled in and attended an after‑school program operated and controlled by Defendant Brockton Community Center.

3. Upon information and belief, Defendant Brockton Community Center is a Massachusetts nonprofit or other organized entity doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal place of business that includes operations at or from facilities located at or including 45 Thatcher Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, controlled, managed, and/or maintained an after‑school program, including a gymnasium and related facilities, at or associated with 45 Thatcher Street, Brockton, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

5. At all relevant times, Defendant employed, supervised, and/or controlled staff members and other personnel responsible for the care, supervision, and safety of children, including J.S., attending its after‑school program.

                         II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This is a civil action for negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

7. The Superior Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 and G.L. c. 231, § 1, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 when considering medical expenses, pain and suffering, and other damages reasonably expected to be proved at trial.

8. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and 8 because the cause of action arose within Bristol County, namely at the Premises located at or associated with 45 Thatcher Street in Brockton, Massachusetts.

9. Defendant transacts business and operates the after‑school program within Bristol County, and the acts and omissions complained of herein occurred in Bristol County.

                            III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

10. Defendant operates an after‑school program at the Premises in Brockton, Massachusetts, which, among other services, provides recreation and gymnasium activities for school‑aged children.

11. Defendant advertises and represents, expressly and by implication, that children in its after‑school program, including while in the gym, will be supervised at all times by staff members and that such supervision will be adequate to maintain a safe environment.

12. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s minor son, J.S., then eight (8) years old and small for his age, attended Defendant’s after‑school program at the Premises.

13. On that date, J.S. and approximately twenty (20) other children were in the gymnasium of the Premises during the after‑school program.

14. Defendant’s policies and/or customary practice, as communicated to parents, included that two staff members would supervise such groups of children when in the gym.

15. Despite that representation, on September 15, 2023, only one staff member remained in actual physical presence in the gym with the approximately twenty children.

16. The second staff member who was supposed to supervise the children left the gym to go to an office area to perform paperwork or other administrative tasks, thereby leaving a single staff member to supervise the entire group.

17. The remaining staff member positioned herself near the bleachers, away from the active area of play on the gym floor.

18. Rather than actively supervising, monitoring, and controlling the children’s activities in the gym, the staff member was primarily looking at and using her cell phone.

19. While the staff member was distracted and not providing active supervision, two older and significantly larger boys, approximately twelve (12) years old, began engaging in rough, physical “tackle” play or games on the hardwood gym floor.

20. The rough tackle play was open, obvious, and of a nature that would have been readily observable to a reasonably attentive and prudent supervisor.

21. The tackle game was inherently dangerous given the hard gym floor, the size and strength differences between children, and the mixed ages of the group that included younger and smaller children such as J.S.

22. Several children noticed the dangerous behavior and reported it to the supervising staff member.

23. In response to those reports, the staff member failed to intervene, failed to stop the rough play, and failed to separate the older boys from the rest of the children.

24. Instead, the supervising staff member dismissively replied, “boys will be boys,” and allowed the dangerous tackle activity to continue unabated on the hard gym floor.

25. At that time, J.S., as a small and vulnerable eight‑year‑old, was present on the gym floor in the vicinity of the older boys’ tackle activity.

26. Shortly thereafter, one of the larger boys violently tackled J.S. to the ground.

27. As a result of the tackle, J.S. was forcefully thrown to the hardwood gym floor and struck his head.

28. J.S. immediately lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

29. The incident occurred directly in the gymnasium where Defendant’s staff member was present but failed to adequately supervise, monitor, or manage the children’s activities.

30. Emergency medical care was required for J.S. as a result of the incident.

31. J.S. was transported to an emergency room, where he was evaluated, diagnosed, and treated for a concussion.

32. J.S. experienced headaches, dizziness, confusion, and other symptoms associated with concussion and head trauma.

33. As a result of his injuries, J.S. missed several days of school and other normal activities.

34. Plaintiff incurred and continues to incur medical expenses for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow‑up care of J.S.’s concussion.

35. Plaintiff’s medical expenses to date related to the injuries sustained on September 15, 2023, are approximately $4,500, and additional expenses may reasonably be incurred in the future.

36. Defendant, through its agents, servants, and/or employees, had actual and constructive knowledge of the risks inherent in children’s rough play and horseplay, particularly tackle‑type activities on hard gym floors.

37. Defendant knew or should have known that mixed‑age groups of children, including younger and smaller children, require meaningful, consistent, and attentive supervision to prevent foreseeable injuries.

38. Defendant knew or should have known that allowing older, larger children to engage in rough tackle games around significantly smaller children in a confined gym space with a hard floor created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of serious physical injury, including head injuries such as concussion.

39. Defendant held itself out as competent and qualified to supervise children safely in an after‑school program and to provide an adequately supervised gym environment.

40. Plaintiff reasonably relied upon Defendant’s representations and undertakings that his son would be supervised at all times in a safe manner at the Premises.

41. Defendant, by undertaking to provide after‑school care and supervision in its gym, assumed a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising J.S. and the other children.

42. Defendant also owed J.S., as an invitee, a duty to maintain the Premises and its activities in a reasonably safe condition and to protect him from unreasonable risks of harm of which Defendant knew or reasonably should have known.

43. Notwithstanding its duty to exercise reasonable care, Defendant failed to provide adequate supervision on September 15, 2023.

44. Defendant failed to ensure that the promised two staff members remained in the gym supervising the children.

45. Defendant failed to adopt, implement, or enforce adequate policies regarding staff presence, supervision ratios, and restrictions on using personal cell phones while supervising children.

46. Defendant failed to train and supervise its employees and agents adequately regarding the need to stop dangerous roughhousing and tackle games and to separate older, larger children from younger, smaller children when necessary for safety.

47. Defendant’s staff member failed to pay reasonable attention to the children in her charge and instead diverted her attention to personal cell phone usage.

48. Defendant’s staff member failed to respond appropriately when notified that older boys were engaging in rough and dangerous physical contact play.

49. Defendant’s staff member negligently dismissed specific warnings and visible dangerous conduct with the remark “boys will be boys,” and thereby ratified or encouraged the continuation of the unsafe behavior.

50. Defendant, through its agents, servants, and/or employees, failed to take simple, reasonable steps that would have eliminated or minimized the risk of harm, including but not limited to: (a) ordering the older boys to stop the tackle game; (b) separating older and younger children; (c) instituting safe, supervised games; and/or (d) stationing the staff member in a position of active and close observation.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, J.S. was tackled by an older child, violently struck his head on the gym floor, lost consciousness, and suffered a concussion and related injuries.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.S. endured physical pain, suffering, and discomfort.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.S. has suffered, and may continue to suffer, emotional distress, anxiety, and fear associated with gym activities and group play.

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred and will reasonably incur medical expenses and related costs for the treatment of J.S.’s injuries.

55. To the extent allowed by law, Plaintiff, as parent and next friend, seeks recovery for his minor child’s past and future pain and suffering, and all other compensable damages under Massachusetts law, as well as reimbursement of Plaintiff’s out‑of‑pocket medical expenses.

                          IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                           (NEGLIGENCE ONLY)

56. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 55 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

57. Under Massachusetts law, negligence consists of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, a breach of that duty, causation, and resulting damages. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

Duty

58. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to J.S. arising from: (a) its status as the operator of the after‑school program that undertook to supervise and protect children in its care; and (b) its control over the Premises and the activities conducted thereon. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 50–51 (1983) (duty arising from voluntary assumption of responsibility for student safety); Irwin v. Town of Ware, 392 Mass. 745, 756 (1984) (duty where defendant’s conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm).

59. Defendant owed J.S. the duty to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent childcare and recreational facility would use under like circumstances in supervising children in its charge and in controlling activities in its gym so as to avoid subjecting them to unreasonable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (possessor of land owes lawful visitors a duty of reasonable care); Schofield v. Merrill, 386 Mass. 244, 246 (1982) (duty of care is that of the ordinary prudent person under the circumstances).

60. Defendant owed a duty to protect J.S., a foreseeable and clearly identifiable member of the class of persons entrusted to its care, from unreasonable physical harm caused by the conduct of other children when such harm was reasonably foreseeable and preventable through the exercise of reasonable supervision and control. See Remy v. MacDonald, 440 Mass. 675, 677–78 (2004); Wallace v. Wilson, 411 Mass. 8, 11–12 (1991).

61. By undertaking to operate an after‑school program and advertising that children would be “supervised at all times in the gym,” Defendant assumed a duty to exercise reasonable care consistent with those representations, and Plaintiff reasonably relied upon that undertaking. See Mullins, 389 Mass. at 50–52; McDonald v. Lavery, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1108, 1109 (1989) (Rule 1:28 decision) (duty arising from assumption of supervision).

Breach

62. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by failing to supervise J.S. and the other children adequately on September 15, 2023.

63. Defendant breached its duty by failing to ensure that two staff members remained present in the gym to supervise approximately twenty children, despite representing that such supervision would be provided.

64. Defendant breached its duty by allowing one staff member to leave the gym for paperwork or other non‑supervisory tasks while children were present and active on the gym floor.

65. Defendant breached its duty by permitting the remaining staff member to engage in personal cell phone use while responsible for supervising the children’s physical activities.

66. Defendant breached its duty by failing to pay reasonable attention to the activities of the children, particularly the development of rough tackle play by older boys on the hard gym floor.

67. Defendant breached its duty by failing to respond appropriately when notified by other children that two older boys were engaging in dangerous, rough tackle games.

68. Defendant breached its duty by dismissing specific complaints about dangerous activity with the remark “boys will be boys,” thereby allowing the conduct to continue.

69. Defendant breached its duty by failing to stop the tackle game, failing to separate older children from younger children, and failing to impose safer, organized activities reasonable under the circumstances.

70. Defendant breached its duty by failing to adopt, implement, and enforce reasonable rules and policies aimed at preventing unsafe horseplay and tackle games in the gym.

71. Defendant breached its duty by failing to train, supervise, and monitor its staff to ensure that they would exercise reasonable care in supervising children and intervening to prevent foreseeable injuries from rough play. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 148–49 (negligent failure to control and supervise foreseeable risks).

72. Defendant’s acts and omissions described herein constitute a failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent operator of a community center after‑school program in Massachusetts would have exercised under like circumstances.

Causation

73. Defendant’s breaches of its duty of care directly and proximately caused J.S.’s injuries. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002) (causation where negligent conduct is substantial contributing factor).

74. Had Defendant provided adequate supervision, including (a) maintaining two staff members in the gym, (b) prohibiting cell phone distraction, and (c) responding appropriately to complaints about dangerous play, the rough tackle game would have been stopped or prevented.

75. But for Defendant’s negligence in failing to intervene, J.S. would not have been tackled by the older boy, would not have struck his head on the hardwood floor, and would not have suffered a concussion and associated injuries.

76. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in bringing about J.S.’s injuries and Plaintiff’s resulting damages.

Damages

77. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.S. sustained a concussion, loss of consciousness, pain, physical and emotional suffering, and other injuries and impairments.

78. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.S. required emergency room treatment, medical evaluation, and follow‑up care, and may require additional treatment in the future.

79. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.S. missed several days of school and normal childhood activities and experienced disruption of his daily life.

80. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses for the evaluation and treatment of J.S.’s concussion, and Plaintiff may incur additional reasonable medical expenses in the future.

81. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on any damages awarded for personal injuries.

82. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of his minor son, J.S., for J.S.’s pain and suffering, emotional distress, and all other compensable elements of damage, and also in his individual capacity for recovery of medical and related expenses incurred on behalf of his minor child. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 85, 85L.

83. Defendant’s negligence was not excused or justified by any contributory negligence on the part of J.S., who was a minor eight‑year‑old child and was entitled to a heightened degree of protection. See G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence); Gage v. City of Westfield, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 694 (1988).

84. To the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff asserts that J.S.’s conduct, as a minor eight‑year‑old boy under the care and supervision of Defendant, was entirely reasonable under the circumstances, and that any such alleged negligence, if found, was not greater than Defendant’s negligence.

85. Defendant is liable to Plaintiff, as parent and next friend of J.S., for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions under the common law of negligence in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 146–47; Mounsey, 363 Mass. at 707.

                          V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jason Smith, as parent and next friend of his minor son, J.S., respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Brockton Community Center, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial for J.S.’s past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and all other elements of personal injury damages recognized under Massachusetts law;

B. Reimbursement to Plaintiff of all past medical expenses reasonably incurred, presently estimated at approximately $4,500, plus all additional medical and related expenses reasonably incurred in the future as a result of the injuries described herein;

C. Prejudgment interest on all damages awarded pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law;

D. Costs of this action, including allowable fees and expenses, pursuant to G.L. c. 261 and other applicable law;

E. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                         VI. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
