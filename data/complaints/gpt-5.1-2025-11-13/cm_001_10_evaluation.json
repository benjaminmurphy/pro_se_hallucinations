McDonald is a concurring opinion focused on statutory interpretation of the paternity statute and the mother\u2019s unilateral right to relocate before paternity is established. It does not discuss a material and substantial change of circumstances or when a change would warrant modification of a parenting-time schedule under G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. Instead, it emphasizes that the judge was not allowed to order the child and mother back to Massachusetts and that the relocation had to be accepted as a given when fashioning custody and visitation, which is the opposite of using the relocation as a basis to modify parenting time to serve the child\u2019s best interests.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAfter paternity was established, the judge was obligated to take as a given that the mother and the child resided 400 miles apart from, and in another State than, the father, and to fashion custody and visitation orders pursuant to the three factors set out in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), again respecting and not disturbing the mother\u2019s decision to relocate. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843 (2003).\u201d"

While this case arises in an adoption/care-and-protection context rather than c. 208 or c. 209C, it clearly reaffirms that the controlling consideration in resolving competing custody/adoption plans is the child\u2019s best interests, which is consistent with the proposition\u2019s statement of Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Once the judge concluded that parental unfitness was established, he correctly determined that the central question was whether it was in Hugo\u2019s best interests to remain with his foster mother or to be transferred to the care and custody of his aunt.

While it notes the child\u2019s age and some aspects of his school performance and relationship with his parents, it does not articulate any general principle that children of a certain age require consistent routines and stability.
