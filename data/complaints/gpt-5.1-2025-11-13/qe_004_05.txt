COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Maria Gonzales (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Steven Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maria Gonzales is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts 01603.

2. Defendant Steven Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Premises”) and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

4. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. The Worcester District Court (Housing Court Department – Central Division) has subject matter jurisdiction over this residential landlord–tenant dispute pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3, because this action involves claims arising out of a residential rental agreement and alleged violations of rights and duties relating to the condition and use of residential premises.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because the Premises are located in Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this county.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement (written or oral) with Defendant for the lease of a residential apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

8. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Apartment as her primary residence since on or about June 1, 2022.

9. Plaintiff pays monthly rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,200.00, which Defendant accepts.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the owner, lessor, or person in control of the Premises and is responsible for maintaining the Apartment and building in compliance with applicable law, including the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., and for ensuring Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

11. Approximately three months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings and other evidence of rodent activity in her kitchen, including on counters, in cabinets, and near stored food.

12. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent infestation and the presence of mouse droppings in the kitchen.

13. Plaintiff has made multiple complaints to Defendant over this period, informing Defendant that she continued to observe mouse droppings on a regular basis, including on at least a weekly basis.

14. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant placed a few mouse traps in the Apartment. These traps caught only approximately two mice and did not resolve the continuing infestation.

15. Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings regularly after the traps were set, indicating that the rodent problem was ongoing and not adequately addressed.

16. Defendant also hired an exterminator for a single visit to the Premises. The exterminator inspected and treated the unit once.

17. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive and ongoing treatment—beyond a single visit—to properly address the rodent infestation.

18. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for any additional, more comprehensive extermination measures, stating that such measures were, in his view, “overkill” and “too expensive.”

19. Defendant further stated to Plaintiff that the presence of mice or mouse droppings was “normal for older buildings” and suggested that Plaintiff needed to keep her kitchen cleaner.

20. Plaintiff maintains her kitchen in a clean and orderly condition, takes reasonable steps to store food properly, and exercises due care with respect to sanitation.

21. Despite Plaintiff’s reasonable housekeeping, she has continued to discover fresh mouse droppings in her kitchen on a recurring basis over a period of approximately three months.

22. As a result of the rodent infestation, Plaintiff has had to discard food items that were or reasonably could have been contaminated by mice or mouse droppings, including boxed and bagged food that was not fully sealed.

23. Plaintiff has been forced to throw away food with an estimated value of approximately $200.00 over the last several months due to the infestation.

24. Plaintiff also purchased plastic containers and other storage supplies to protect her food from rodent contamination, incurring additional expenses of approximately $80.00.

25. Plaintiff therefore has suffered out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $280.00 as a direct result of the rodent infestation and Defendant’s failure to adequately address it.

26. The persistent presence of rodents and mouse droppings in the kitchen interferes with Plaintiff’s reasonable use and enjoyment of the Premises, particularly her ability to cook, store food, and eat in her own home.

27. Plaintiff experiences ongoing anxiety, distress, and discomfort about using her kitchen, preparing food, and the possibility of contamination and disease from the rodent droppings.

28. At all relevant times, the rodent infestation and repeated presence of mouse droppings in the kitchen rendered the Apartment unfit for human habitation and in violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code.

29. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and related State Sanitary Code provisions, the owner of a dwelling is responsible for maintaining the dwelling free from rodent infestation and for providing adequate extermination services, particularly in multi-unit buildings.

30. Defendant, as the landlord and owner or person in control of the building, is responsible for ensuring code compliance and for providing adequate pest control measures to eliminate rodent infestations affecting tenants.

31. Defendant’s minimal actions—placing a few traps and hiring an exterminator for a single visit, while refusing recommended comprehensive treatment—have been insufficient to correct the defective condition.

32. Defendant has been on notice for at least approximately three months that the Apartment is affected by a continuing rodent infestation but has failed to take reasonable and necessary steps to abate and eliminate the infestation.

33. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to correct the infestation after notice constitutes at least negligent, and in the circumstances unreasonable, interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

34. The repeated and continuing nature of the rodent problem, the visible contamination in the kitchen, and the impact on Plaintiff’s use of essential living space constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and enjoyment of the Apartment.

35. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff to lose the full benefit of her bargain in renting the Apartment, as she is unable to safely and comfortably use the kitchen and food storage areas as a reasonable tenant would.

36. Plaintiff has at all times been ready, willing, and able to comply with her obligations as a tenant, including timely payment of rent and reasonable upkeep of her unit.

37. Any allegation or suggestion by Defendant that Plaintiff’s housekeeping is the cause of the rodent infestation is false and pretextual; the infestation results from building conditions and inadequate pest control, which are within Defendant’s control and responsibility.

38. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered property loss, out-of-pocket costs, and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

39. Plaintiff brings this action solely for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, and seeks appropriate damages and other relief as allowed by law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

40. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 39 as if fully set forth herein.

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits the landlord or any person acting under his control from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises by any act or omission that is unlawful or unreasonable.

42. The statute provides in relevant part that a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

43. Massachusetts courts have long held that serious and ongoing conditions affecting the habitability of a dwelling, including unsanitary or unsafe conditions, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment when the landlord, after notice, fails to take reasonable steps to remedy them. See, e.g.:

   a. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (landlord’s failure to remedy known dangerous condition after notice can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment);

   b. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment for acts or omissions that are the natural and probable consequence of his conduct, even where not intended);

   c. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (reaffirming that G.L. c. 186, § 14 is to be construed broadly to protect tenants from substantial interferences with tenancy);

   d. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (serious recurring conditions, including flooding, can amount to breach of quiet enjoyment and support damages for loss of use);

   e. *Hemingway v. O’Brien*, 326 Mass. 393 (1950) (recognizing tenant’s rights where landlord’s failure to maintain habitability substantially interferes with tenant’s use);

   f. *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (persistent code violations and unremedied conditions can support G.L. c. 186, § 14 liability);

   g. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (affirming liability where landlord’s inaction after notice caused serious interference with tenancy);

   h. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (sanitary code violations may support tenant remedies where they impair habitability).

44. Rodent infestation and the presence of mouse droppings in a tenant’s kitchen and food storage areas violate the State Sanitary Code and materially impair the health, safety, and comfort of occupants, thereby constituting a substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.

45. Under 105 C.M.R. 410.550 and related provisions, the owner of a dwelling is expressly responsible for maintaining the premises free from rodents and providing appropriate extermination measures. Persistent rodent infestation is a condition that renders a unit unfit for human habitation.

46. Massachusetts courts have recognized that sanitary code violations are evidence of uninhabitable conditions that can support claims under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related doctrines. See, e.g.:

   a. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979) (state sanitary code sets minimum habitability standards, violation can justify tenant remedies);

   b. *South Boston Elderly Residences, Inc. v. Moynahan*, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 455 (2017) (serious code violations and failure to alleviate them after notice support tenant defenses and counterclaims);

   c. *Santiago v. Commonwealth*, 428 Mass. 381 (1998) (recognizing the significance of sanitary code compliance in residential tenancies).

47. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation and the ongoing presence of mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen for at least approximately three months before this Complaint, through repeated communications from Plaintiff.

48. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant failed and refused to take reasonable and adequate steps to abate and eliminate the infestation, including rejecting the exterminator’s recommendation for comprehensive treatment due to cost and dismissing the condition as “normal for older buildings.”

49. Defendant’s inadequate response—limited to a few traps and a single exterminator visit—was insufficient, and Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that it was insufficient, given the exterminator’s advice that more comprehensive treatment was necessary.

50. Defendant’s inaction and refusal to implement adequate pest control measures, after receiving actual notice of the continuing infestation, constitute an unreasonable and unlawful “omission” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

51. The natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s failure to sufficiently address the rodent infestation was that Plaintiff would continue to endure rodent activity and mouse droppings in her kitchen, adversely affecting her health, safety, and comfort, and substantially interfering with her use of the Apartment. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

52. Plaintiff’s use of her kitchen—an essential part of the dwelling—has been materially impaired by the rodent infestation, leading to:

   a. Contamination and loss of food;
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses for replacement food and storage containers;
   c. Anxiety and distress regarding the safety and cleanliness of the kitchen;
   d. A loss of the full beneficial use and enjoyment of the Premises for everyday living.

53. Under *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04, and *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 285–86, persistent and serious conditions within a tenant’s living space that are not timely and adequately corrected by the landlord can amount to a breach of quiet enjoyment entitling the tenant to damages.

54. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was continuous and occurred over a period of months and is reasonably expected to continue until adequate extermination measures are taken.

55. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a result of Defendant’s breach, including but not limited to:

   a. Approximately $200.00 in food discarded due to rodent contamination or reasonable fear of contamination;  
   b. Approximately $80.00 spent on plastic containers and related items to protect food;  
   c. The loss of use and enjoyment of the kitchen and associated inconvenience, anxiety, and distress; and  
   d. A diminished value of the tenancy as compared with the rent paid for a habitable and sanitary apartment.

56. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

57. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00. Three months’ rent therefore equals $3,600.00.

58. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages include at least the approximately $280.00 in out-of-pocket costs described above, plus consequential damages for loss of use and enjoyment of a clean and sanitary kitchen and associated distress; however, by statute, she is entitled at a minimum to three months’ rent as damages if liability is found, without any requirement of proving a specific dollar amount of consequential damages beyond the interference itself. *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

59. Plaintiff, acting pro se, does not request attorney’s fees for herself, but notes that G.L. c. 186, § 14 authorizes an award of reasonable attorney’s fees to a successful tenant represented by counsel.

60. Defendant’s actions and omissions, as described above, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.
