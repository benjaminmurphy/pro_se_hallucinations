COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Robert Smith (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

2. Defendant Robert Smith is an individual and the owner and/or manager and lessor of the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under Massachusetts landlord–tenant law, including but not limited to the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of the Somerville District Court.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223 and the applicable District Court venue rules because the leased premises are located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease with Defendant for the second‑floor apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144 (the “Premises”).

8. Under the lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent in the amount of $1,800, which Plaintiff has paid or has been ready, willing, and able to pay at all relevant times.

9. The written lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.

10. Independent of the written lease, Massachusetts law implies a covenant of quiet enjoyment into residential tenancies. See, e.g., G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

11. Plaintiff has continuously resided at the Premises since on or about January 15, 2022, as her primary residence.

12. The property at 123 Elm Street is a typical three‑family “triple‑decker.” Plaintiff occupies the second floor. The third‑floor unit is directly above Plaintiff’s unit and is also owned and controlled by Defendant.

13. Approximately six months ago, new upstairs tenants moved into the third‑floor unit (the “Upstairs Tenants”).

14. Soon after the Upstairs Tenants moved in, Plaintiff began experiencing persistent and excessive noise from the unit above her, including but not limited to:

   a. Loud and continuous stomping and heavy footfalls at all hours of the day and night;  
   b. Music played at high volume late at night; and  
   c. Repeated sounds of heavy furniture or other large objects being moved or dragged across the floor, including around midnight and other late‑night hours.

15. The noise from the Upstairs Tenants has been frequent, ongoing, and severe, occurring on most days and nights over the past several months.

16. The noise routinely continues into late‑night hours and early morning hours, interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and rest in her own home.

17. As a result of the noise, Plaintiff is averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night.

18. Plaintiff has attempted multiple reasonable self‑help measures to mitigate the noise, including purchasing and using earplugs, purchasing and using a white‑noise machine, and rearranging her bedroom and sleeping area within the Premises.

19. Despite these efforts, the noise has remained intrusive and has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her apartment for ordinary residential purposes, particularly for sleep and quiet rest.

20. Plaintiff initially attempted to resolve the matter directly and amicably. Plaintiff spoke personally with the Upstairs Tenants and requested that they reduce their noise and be more considerate of the time of day and of the shared building.

21. After Plaintiff’s initial conversation, the noise temporarily diminished for approximately one week but then returned to its prior excessive levels.

22. Thereafter, Plaintiff made multiple complaints to Defendant about the noise from the Upstairs Tenants, on at least five or six occasions over a period of several months.

23. Plaintiff informed Defendant that the noise was ongoing, excessive, and occurring at late‑night and early‑morning hours, that Plaintiff was losing sleep, and that the problem was significantly affecting her health and ability to live quietly in her home.

24. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant spoke with the Upstairs Tenants only once to address the noise.

25. After that single conversation with the Upstairs Tenants, Defendant took no further effective steps to control or abate the noise, despite Plaintiff’s repeated further complaints.

26. In response to Plaintiff’s subsequent complaints, Defendant informed Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live” or words to that effect, and refused to take additional or meaningful action.

27. At all relevant times, Defendant had the legal right and practical ability, as the landlord and owner of both units, to take reasonable steps to control the conduct of the Upstairs Tenants, including but not limited to written warnings, lease enforcement, imposition of house rules, or, if necessary, termination or nonrenewal of the Upstairs Tenants’ tenancy.

28. Defendant’s inaction and refusal to take effective steps to address the persistent noise, despite multiple complaints and notice of the serious impact on Plaintiff’s living conditions, allowed the situation to continue.

29. The ongoing noise, and Defendant’s failure to remedy it, has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and quiet enjoyment of the Premises as her home.

30. As a result of the prolonged sleep deprivation and stress caused by the noise, Plaintiff’s work performance has deteriorated.

31. Plaintiff received a written warning at work for falling asleep at her desk, an incident directly related to the sleep deprivation caused by the excessive nighttime noise at the Premises.

32. Plaintiff also sought medical treatment as a result of her difficulties sleeping and the stress and exhaustion caused by the noise.

33. Plaintiff’s doctor prescribed sleep medication to address her noise‑induced insomnia.

34. Plaintiff pays approximately $40 per month out‑of‑pocket for this prescribed sleep medication.

35. Plaintiff’s difficulty sleeping, increased stress, work discipline, and out‑of‑pocket medical and medication expenses are a direct and foreseeable result of the persistent noise and Defendant’s failure to abate it.

36. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, substantial loss of the use and enjoyment of her home, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of sleep as a result of Defendant’s conduct and inaction.

37. Plaintiff has also suffered monetary damages, including but not limited to: (a) a reduction in the value of her tenancy during the period of substantial interference; and (b) medical and medication expenses, including monthly out‑of‑pocket costs for sleep medication.

38. Based on the nature, duration, and severity of the interference with her tenancy, Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she is owed at least $1,200 in actual damages related to the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in addition to any statutory or multiple damages and attorney’s fees provided by law.

39. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has remained current in her rent obligations or has been ready, willing, and able to pay rent but for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

40. Plaintiff has not caused or contributed to the excessive noise and has acted at all times as a reasonable tenant, attempting to resolve the problem directly and through the landlord.

41. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to control the conduct of the Upstairs Tenants after repeated complaints, and despite knowledge that the conduct was seriously interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, constitutes an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Common Law**

42. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–41 as if fully set forth herein.

43. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and a landlord who does so is liable for actual and statutory damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees.

44. Massachusetts law also recognizes a common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential leases, which prohibits a landlord from allowing substantial interference with a tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

45. In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord may be liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s failure to control activities on adjacent property he also controls (such as a noisy lounge) results in substantial interference with tenants’ use of their apartments, even if the landlord did not personally create the noise.

46. Similar to Blackett, Defendant here owned and controlled both Plaintiff’s unit and the upstairs unit and had the ability to control the activities of the Upstairs Tenants yet failed to take reasonable steps to prevent or abate the persistent, excessive noise that interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment.

47. A landlord’s persistent failure to respond reasonably to tenant complaints about serious and ongoing interference can constitute “direct or indirect” interference under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982) (landlord’s failure to deal reasonably with flooding and sewage backups could constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (recognizing that landlord’s inaction in the face of known conditions impacting tenants’ safety or enjoyment can support a claim).

48. The excessive noise from the Upstairs Tenants, occurring at late‑night and early‑morning hours on an ongoing basis, constitutes a substantial interference with the quiet and peaceful use of the Premises and goes beyond ordinary, incidental sounds of apartment living.

49. Defendant was repeatedly placed on notice of the noise problem and its severity through Plaintiff’s multiple complaints.

50. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable or effective steps to remedy the situation or enforce lease terms and building rules against the Upstairs Tenants.

51. Defendant’s statement that he “can’t control how people live,” and his refusal to act further after one conversation with the Upstairs Tenants, demonstrate a conscious disregard of his statutory and common‑law obligations to protect Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

52. Defendant’s inaction and refusal to meaningfully intervene, in the face of known and ongoing interference, constitute “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716–19; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–78 (1994) (discussing landlord responsibility for conditions interfering with tenants’ enjoyment).

53. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment caused by Defendant’s conduct and omissions was substantial, material, and not merely trifling or transitory. See AlZiab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (quiet enjoyment protects against serious interferences with use of leased premises).

54. Defendant’s breach has directly caused Plaintiff to suffer:  
   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of her home due to chronic noise and sleep disturbance;  
   b. Emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience;  
   c. Work‑related consequences, including a written warning due to sleep deprivation; and  
   d. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for medical visits and prescribed sleep medication (approximately $40 per month), among other damages.

55. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

56. The monthly rent for Plaintiff’s apartment is $1,800. Three months’ rent equals $5,400.

57. Plaintiff’s actual damages include, but are not limited to: (a) a reduction in the fair value of the tenancy during the period of interference; (b) out‑of‑pocket medical and medication expenses; and (c) non‑economic damages for distress and loss of use, which Plaintiff estimates to total at least $1,200, exclusive of any statutory multiple damages.

58. Plaintiff is therefore entitled, at a minimum, to the statutory remedy under G.L. c. 186, § 14 of three months’ rent ($5,400) or her actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

59. In assessing damages for breach of quiet enjoyment, Massachusetts courts recognize that both economic and non‑economic harms may be considered, including distress and disruption to daily life. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 103–06; see also Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. at 776–79; AlZiab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 851–52.

60. Massachusetts law further recognizes that a landlord’s pattern of ignoring tenant complaints and failing to correct conditions can warrant multiple damages and fee shifting under various housing statutes designed to protect tenants’ basic living conditions. See, e.g., G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 239, § 8A; see also Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (establishing strong public policy in favor of habitable and reasonably quiet housing).

61. By allowing the ongoing, excessive noise from the Upstairs Tenants to persist after repeated notice and by failing to act reasonably to abate it, Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment contained in the lease and imposed by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and common law.

62. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has been damaged and is entitled to actual and statutory damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees as provided by law.

F. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
