The landlords argue that they did not violate the tenants\u2019 implied covenant of quiet enjoyment because they are not chargeable with the noise from the lounge. Our opinions concerning a constructive eviction by an alleged breach of an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment sometimes have stated that the landlord must perform some act with the intent of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment and occupation of the whole or part of the leased premises."
