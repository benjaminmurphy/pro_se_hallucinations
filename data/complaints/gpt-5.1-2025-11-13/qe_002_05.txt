JORDAN MITCHELL,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

LILY ANDERSON,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
CIVIL ACTION NO. _________  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell (“Plaintiff” or “Mr. Mitchell”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant, Lily Anderson (“Defendant” or “Ms. Anderson”), is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

3. This action arises from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s residential tenancy at the Premises, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law.

4. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, is approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) in property damages, plus statutory damages, rent abatement, and other relief available under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related law.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action involving residential housing and tenancies located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Housing Court Department, Boston Division.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because the Premises are located in Roxbury, Massachusetts, within the Court’s jurisdiction, and the cause of action arose there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease with Defendant for the rental of the basement apartment at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the “Lease”).

8. Under the Lease, Plaintiff pays monthly rent of One Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($1,200.00), due on the first day of each month.

9. From March 1, 2022, through the present, Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Premises as his primary residence.

10. Plaintiff has, at all relevant times, substantially complied with his obligations as a tenant, including timely payment of rent with one limited exception described below.

11. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff’s rent payment was approximately two (2) weeks late due to unexpected medical bills.

12. Plaintiff paid the October 2025 rent in full, including any late fee demanded by Defendant, and Defendant accepted that payment.

13. In November 2025, Plaintiff began to notice water seeping into the Premises through a basement wall whenever it rained heavily.

14. The water intrusion was substantial enough to wet the interior wall area, the floor adjacent to that wall, and personal property belonging to Plaintiff.

15. The water condition created dampness and required Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier continuously or near-continuously to attempt to control moisture and prevent mold or further damage.

16. Running the dehumidifier extensively increased Plaintiff’s electric usage and electric bills.

17. On or about early to mid-November 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant via text message of the water intrusion problem and the damage and inconvenience it was causing.

18. In response, Defendant stated she would “look into it,” but did not promptly arrange for repairs or remediation.

19. Several weeks passed with no meaningful action or repair by Defendant to address the water intrusion or to prevent further seepage during rainstorms.

20. During this period, each heavy rain caused additional water seepage into the Premises, continuing the interference with Plaintiff’s normal residential use and enjoyment.

21. Because Defendant failed to remedy the condition after being notified, Plaintiff contacted the appropriate city authorities in Boston/Roxbury in or about late November 2025.

22. City inspectors came to the Premises to conduct an inspection.

23. The city inspection identified the water intrusion problem and, upon information and belief, found additional housing code and/or sanitary code violations at the Premises.

24. The existence of water entering a basement apartment through a wall during rainfall is a condition that can violate the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to provisions requiring that dwelling units be maintained in a watertight condition and free from chronic dampness. See 105 C.M.R. 410.500, 410.550, 410.602.

25. As a result of the water intrusion, Plaintiff’s rug on the affected area of floor became wet and was ruined.

26. As a result of the water intrusion, Plaintiff’s bookshelf placed against the affected wall became wet and was damaged.

27. The combined reasonable value of Plaintiff’s damaged or destroyed personal property, including the rug and bookshelf, is approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00).

28. Despite the city inspection and Plaintiff’s repeated concerns, Defendant still did not timely or adequately repair the water intrusion as of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025.

29. The ongoing failure to keep the Premises reasonably dry, watertight, and free from water seepage has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s comfort, safety, and ability to use the apartment in an ordinary, healthy, and dignified manner.

30. In addition to the physical damage and moisture, Plaintiff has had to endure the stress, annoyance, inconvenience, and disruption caused by repeated water intrusion and the need to rearrange furniture and belongings to avoid further damage.

31. After Plaintiff contacted city inspectors and an inspection occurred, Defendant began referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

32. Defendant informed Plaintiff that she would not renew his Lease when it expires in March 2026 (the current lease term covering March 2025 to March 2026), stating that this decision was due to the late October 2025 rent.

33. The timing of Defendant’s decision and her statements, occurring shortly after Plaintiff contacted city authorities about the water condition, strongly suggest that Defendant’s decision not to renew is in fact retaliatory and linked to Plaintiff’s protected complaints and the inspection. See G.L. c. 186, § 18.

34. Regardless of the stated reason for non-renewal, Defendant’s ongoing failure to repair the chronic water intrusion and maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code constitutes an “act” or “omission” that unlawfully interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease or tenancy in Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929).

36. Defendant, as landlord and owner, is responsible for complying with the State Sanitary Code and maintaining the Premises in a habitable condition. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

37. The persistent water intrusion and moisture, together with Defendant’s failure to remedy the condition after notice and city inspection, substantially impair Plaintiff’s ability to use his apartment as a safe, comfortable, and habitable dwelling.

38. Multiple Massachusetts appellate cases have held that failure to maintain rental premises in sanitary, habitable condition, especially where violations of the State Sanitary Code are involved, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:

  a. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord’s acts or omissions that substantially interfere with tenant’s use amount to breach of quiet enjoyment, even without intent);

  b. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (sanitary code violations can justify rent abatement and constitute breach of landlord’s duties);

  c. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (landlord’s failure to correct conditions violating State Sanitary Code supports liability);

  d. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (recognizing breadth of quiet enjoyment protections in residential settings);

  e. Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (summary eviction and serious conditions may constitute breach of quiet enjoyment);

  f. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (substantial interference with use of premises, including code violations, established breach of quiet enjoyment).

39. Defendant’s conduct is also unlawful because G.L. c. 186, § 14 explicitly provides that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so is liable for (a) actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and for (b) costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

40. Plaintiff is a residential “occupant” of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

41. Defendant is a “lessor” or “landlord” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

42. The water intrusion, chronic dampness, and unremedied sanitary code violations in the Premises, and Defendant’s failure to address them after notice, constitute “acts” or “omissions” as those terms are used in G.L. c. 186, § 14.

43. These acts and omissions have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, and thereby breached the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered:

  a. Property damage of approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) to his rug and bookshelf;

  b. Increased utility expenses from running a dehumidifier to cope with water intrusion;

  c. Loss of use, discomfort, inconvenience, and interference with his ability to use and enjoy his home;

  d. Emotional distress, annoyance, and aggravation associated with living in an unreasonably damp, water-infiltrated unit and with Defendant’s dismissive response; and

  e. Loss of the full value of the Premises as a habitable residential dwelling, entitling him to rent abatement during the period of breach.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either actual and consequential damages (including, but not limited to, property damage, rent abatement, and consequential costs) or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

46. Three months’ rent at the Premises is Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600.00), calculated as $1,200.00 per month multiplied by three.

47. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including property damage, rent abatement arising from the reduction in fair rental value during the period of water intrusion and code violations, increased utility costs, and related losses, may approach or exceed Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600.00), but in any event Plaintiff seeks at least the statutory minimum remedy of three months’ rent as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent it exceeds actual damages.

48. Plaintiff also seeks such additional equitable and declaratory relief as this Court deems just and proper to remedy Defendant’s ongoing failure to maintain the Premises in a sanitary and habitable condition, including orders requiring timely remediation of the water intrusion and related code violations.

49. Although this Complaint focuses on the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff notes that the same facts may also implicate related statutory protections, including but not limited to G.L. c. 239, § 8A (defenses and counterclaims in summary process), G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L (State Sanitary Code enforcement), and G.L. c. 186, § 18 (retaliation), and the Court may consider those statutes in interpreting the scope and seriousness of the landlord’s obligations and the remedies available.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14; Common Law)  

50. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 49 as if fully set forth herein.

51. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful residential tenant and occupant of the Premises pursuant to the Lease.

52. Defendant, as landlord, owed Plaintiff an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and common-law principles. See Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33 (1929); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

53. The covenant of quiet enjoyment guarantees that a landlord will not, by act or omission, substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

54. Defendant, after being notified by Plaintiff of the water intrusion and after inspection by city authorities, failed to take timely and effective steps to repair the water infiltration and associated deficiencies.

55. Defendant’s omissions in failing to repair the water intrusion and cure the resulting sanitary code violations constitute “acts or omissions” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

56. These acts and omissions caused chronic or recurring water seepage into the Premises during rainstorms, creating persistent dampness, risk of mold, and damage to Plaintiff’s personal property and comfort.

57. The water intrusion and resulting conditions rendered the Premises substantially less safe, sanitary, comfortable, and habitable than a reasonable tenant would expect, and significantly diminished the value and enjoyment of the Premises to Plaintiff. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 192–99 (linking habitability and tenant remedies to State Sanitary Code).

58. Under Massachusetts law, substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises—especially where sanitary code violations are involved—constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, regardless of whether the landlord subjectively intended the interference. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Doe, 417 Mass. at 282–83.

59. Defendant’s conduct and omissions described above have, separately and collectively, substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

60. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is further evidenced by the city inspection findings of water intrusion and other code issues, showing noncompliance with the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500 (structural elements to be kept in good repair and watertight), 410.550 (dampness and water penetration), and 410.602 (maintenance of dwellings in compliance with the Code).

61. Defendant’s efforts—if any—to address the water problem were so delayed and ineffective as to be unreasonable and to constitute a continuing breach of her obligations as landlord.

62. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered the damages described above, including but not limited to property damage, increased utility costs, loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, and rent abatement due to the reduced fair rental value of the Premises.

63. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and relevant case law, including Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19, Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979), and related decisions, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either:

  a. His actual and consequential damages; or  

  b. Three months’ rent at the Premises,  

whichever amount is greater, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any attorney representation is obtained or fees are otherwise awarded).

64. Three months’ rent at the Premises totals Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600.00).

65. Plaintiff therefore seeks judgment against Defendant for at least Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600.00) or his actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs, interest, and such attorney’s fees and additional relief as the Court deems just.
