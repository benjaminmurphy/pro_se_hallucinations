v.  

THOMAS BENNETT,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C; M.G.L. c. 208, § 31)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, RACHEL BENNETT (“Mother”), and respectfully complains of the Defendant, THOMAS BENNETT (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Bennett.

2. The Defendant, Thomas Bennett, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Bennett.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:
   - Ethan Bennett, age 8.

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6, and M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, because the existing custody order was entered in this Court and the minor child resides within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

### II. PRIOR COURT ORDER

5. On or about April 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody and parenting-time judgment (the “2019 Judgment”) concerning the minor child, Ethan Bennett.

6. Under the 2019 Judgment, the Mother was granted primary physical custody of Ethan, and the Father was granted parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and one Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.

7. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, Ethan was approximately three (3) years old, was not yet school‑aged, and the Father was living in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have an appropriate, separate sleeping area or bedroom for the child.

8. The 2019 Judgment was based on the child’s then‑tender age, the Father’s then‑current housing circumstances, and the need to ensure a safe and stable environment, consistent with M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the child’s best interests.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since the entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the minor child and the practical operation of the existing parenting plan.

10. Ethan is now eight (8) years old and is enrolled in school full‑time. His developmental needs, school schedule, homework responsibilities, extracurricular activities (if any), and daily structure differ significantly from when he was three years old.

11. The Father’s living situation has materially improved. He now has his own apartment, without roommates, where Ethan has his own separate bedroom and appropriate furnishings, providing a safe and stable environment suitable for overnight parenting time.

12. The existing schedule, which was structured around short, non‑overnight visits several times per week and a Sunday afternoon visit, is no longer well‑suited to the child’s age, schooling, and routine.

13. Under the current order, Ethan is frequently shuttled back and forth for short visits, often on school nights. This repeated transportation disrupts his homework, bedtime routine, and overall stability, and it is exhausting for the child and both parents.

14. Ethan has consistently expressed a desire to have overnight visits and “sleepovers” at his Father’s residence, which is now appropriate and adequately prepared for such visits.

15. Both parents—Mother and Father—recognize and agree that the current parenting schedule is outdated, no longer aligned with Ethan’s age and school obligations, and should be modified to include appropriate overnights with the Father and fewer disruptive, short mid‑week transitions.

16. The material changes described above were not anticipated at the time of the 2019 Judgment and constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of Massachusetts law governing modification of custody and parenting plans, including M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

17. Any modification of custody or parenting time must be based on the best interests of the child. M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; see also **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best interests of the child are paramount in custody decisions).

18. Massachusetts courts require a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances, and (2) that modification is in the child’s best interests. **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177, 183–184 (2006); **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366, 370–371 (1981).

19. Where there is a significant change in a child’s developmental stage, schooling, and a parent’s housing stability, modification of a parenting schedule to meet the child’s current needs is appropriate. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834, 840–842 (2003) (the Court considers the child’s evolving needs and circumstances); **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**.

20. The Father’s improved housing—now a private apartment with a dedicated bedroom for Ethan—removes the primary reason the Court previously restricted overnights and permits a schedule that better fosters a meaningful relationship with both parents, consistent with **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266–267 (2001) (recognizing importance of stability and environment) and **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31**.

21. A schedule including reasonable overnight parenting time with the Father, and fewer short, disruptive transitions during the school week, will provide Ethan with:
   a. More consistent routines for homework and bedtime;  
   b. More meaningful, extended time with each parent; and  
   c. Reduced stress from frequent transitions.

22. Massachusetts law favors arrangements that encourage frequent and continuing contact with both parents, where consistent with the child’s best interests. **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–405 (1981); **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31**.

23. The Mother remains an appropriate primary physical custodian, and the Father remains an appropriate and committed parent ready to exercise expanded parenting time. There is no allegation of abuse, neglect, or unfitness with respect to either parent.

24. The parties’ mutual recognition that modification is needed supports a finding that the existing order is no longer workable and that a new schedule will better serve Ethan’s best interests, consistent with **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981) (modification warranted when existing order no longer serves its intended purpose).

25. In determining the best interests of the child, the Court may consider, among other factors: the child’s age and developmental stage, the child’s relationship with each parent, the child’s current living and school situation, and each parent’s ability to provide stability and meet the child’s needs. See **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590, 595–596 (1996); **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219, 225–226 (1998).

26. For school‑aged children, courts recognize that the structure of the school week and the need for routine are highly relevant in assessing parenting schedules. See **Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser**, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 908, 909–910 (2005) (rescript opinion) (upholding adjustments in parenting time to accommodate school and routine).

27. The requested modification is tailored to address Ethan’s current age, his full‑time school schedule, and the Father’s enhanced ability to provide suitable overnight care, while preserving Ethan’s primary residence with the Mother for continuity and stability, in accordance with **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. at 843–844.

28. Any modification ordered by the Court must be grounded in Ethan’s welfare and best interests, not the preferences of the parents, but here the parents’ agreement that the existing plan is no longer appropriate reinforces that modification is in Ethan’s best interests. See **Vilakazi v. Maxie**, 371 Mass. 406, 409–410 (1976).

### V. APPLICABLE STATUTES AND CASE LAW

29. M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Court to modify judgments regarding custody and visitation upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. at 183–184.

30. M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 directs the Court to allocate custody and parenting time in accordance with the best interests of the child, considering the child’s welfare as the paramount concern.

31. The principles governing custody and parenting‑time determinations, including the “best interests” standard, have been elaborated in:  
   - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981);  
   - **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   - **Schuler v. Schuler**, 382 Mass. 366 (1981);  
   - **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - **Adoption of Hugo**, 428 Mass. 219 (1998);  
   - **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981);  
   - **Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser**, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 908 (2005).

32. To the extent this matter may also fall under or implicate the provisions of M.G.L. c. 209C (for custody and support of children born outside of marriage, where applicable), M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20 likewise permits modification of existing orders upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances and the best interests of the child.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

33. The Mother seeks a modification of the 2019 Judgment to reflect the child’s current needs and the Father’s present circumstances, while keeping the Mother as primary physical custodian.

34. Specifically, the Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Confirm that Rachel Bennett remains the primary physical custodian of Ethan Bennett, subject to the Father’s parenting time as set forth in the modified schedule.

   b. Grant the Father regular overnight parenting time appropriate for an eight‑year‑old child with full‑time school obligations. A typical schedule that would serve Ethan’s best interests includes, for example (subject to the Court’s discretion):

      i. On alternating weeks, the Father to have parenting time from Friday after school (or a set time, e.g., 5:00 p.m.) until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., including two consecutive overnights; and  

      ii. On the non‑weekend weeks, one mid‑week dinner or limited‑duration visit (at a time that does not unduly interfere with homework and bedtime), or, if the Court finds it appropriate and feasible, one mid‑week overnight, provided it is compatible with Ethan’s school schedule and well‑being.

   c. Adjust or eliminate the prior pattern of multiple short, non‑overnight visits during the school week to a schedule that minimizes disruptions to Ethan’s schoolwork and bedtime routines while still affording frequent, meaningful contact with the Father.

   d. Establish an age‑appropriate holiday and school‑vacation schedule reasonably dividing holidays, school vacations, and summer vacation between the parents in a manner consistent with Ethan’s best interests, with overnights with both parents as appropriate.

   e. Provide that both parents shall continue to share major decisions concerning Ethan’s education, medical care, and religious upbringing, consistent with the concept of shared legal custody, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

   f. Include such further clarifying provisions as the Court deems necessary to implement a predictable, stable schedule that reduces conflict and confusion, promotes Ethan’s stability, and fosters his relationship with both parents.

35. The requested modifications do not seek to diminish either parent’s role in Ethan’s life, but rather to align the custodial and parenting‑time arrangement with the significant changes in Ethan’s age, schooling, and the Father’s improved housing situation, in accordance with Massachusetts law.

36. The requested relief is reasonable, in Ethan’s best interests, and supported by the material changes in circumstances described above.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2019 custody and parenting‑time judgment;

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Bennett;

3. Issue a Modified Judgment providing, in substance, that:

   a. Rachel Bennett remains the primary physical custodian of Ethan Bennett;

   b. Thomas Bennett is granted expanded, regular overnight parenting time with Ethan, including at least alternating weekend overnights and an age‑appropriate, less‑disruptive schedule during the school week, as the Court deems appropriate;

   c. The pattern of multiple short, non‑overnight visits during the week is replaced with a schedule that supports Ethan’s school attendance, homework completion, and consistent bedtime routine;

   d. Holiday, school‑vacation, and summer parenting time is reasonably allocated between the parents with appropriate overnights, consistent with Ethan’s best interests;

   e. Legal custody (decision‑making authority concerning major issues such as education, medical care, and religious upbringing) is confirmed as shared between the parties, unless the Court orders otherwise;

4. Order that the prior April 15, 2019 judgment be modified only to the extent inconsistent with the new Modified Judgment, and that all other provisions remain in full force and effect unless expressly changed;

5. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests and welfare of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,  
RACHEL BENNETT
