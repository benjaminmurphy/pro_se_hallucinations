Here, the Court\u2019s focus is narrowly on whether a strict-liability lead paint violation automatically constitutes a \u00a7 14 violation and on the mental state (at least negligence) required, not on the measure of damages under \u00a7 14.",

Thus the case implicitly affirms that a landlord\u2019s failure to remedy serious, ongoing defects after notice can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",

Heat in the apartment ranged from nonexistent (at worst) to insufficient (at best). Cruz Management had notice of these defects, as well as others\u2026 Most of the violations remained uncorrected through October, 1990\u2026 Although the judge found a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, he awarded no damages on this claim to avoid what would have been a duplicative award."
