THOMAS RICHARDS,  
    Defendant.  

____________________________________/

                      COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE
                 (PERSONAL INJURY – PREMISES LIABILITY)


Plaintiff Jessica Harmon (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Richards (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                             I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Harmon is an adult individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Thomas Richards is an adult individual who owns, controls, manages, and/or resides at the property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts 01201 (“the Property”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was the owner and person in control of the Property, including the yard and trees located in front of the residence and overhanging the public sidewalk.

                        II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence arising from personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

5. The Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy, including medical expenses, lost wages, and general damages for pain and suffering, exceeds $25,000 when fully and fairly valued.

6. Venue is proper in Berkshire County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the events and injuries giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and the Property that is the subject of this action is situated in Berkshire County.

                            III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Defendant owns and/or controls the residential property known as 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.

8. In the front yard of the Property, adjacent to and overhanging the public sidewalk, there is a large, mature maple tree (“the Tree”).

9. For a substantial period of time prior to August 15, 2023, one of the major branches of the Tree, extending over the sidewalk area routinely traveled by pedestrians, was visibly cracked, drooping, and appeared damaged and unstable (“the Hazardous Branch”).

10. Plaintiff, who regularly walked along that residential street, personally observed that the Hazardous Branch looked cracked, droopy, and unsafe well before August 15, 2023.

11. Neighbors in the area also observed the dangerous condition of the Hazardous Branch and, on multiple occasions prior to August 15, 2023, communicated their concerns to Defendant.

12. Upon information and belief, neighbors explicitly suggested that Defendant have the Tree and the Hazardous Branch evaluated and addressed by a qualified arborist or tree professional.

13. In response to these concerns and suggestions, Defendant stated that he would “deal with it in the spring” or words to that effect, acknowledging both awareness of the condition and the need for remedial action.

14. Despite this actual notice and acknowledgment, Defendant failed to have the Tree evaluated, pruned, stabilized, or otherwise made safe, and failed to remove or repair the Hazardous Branch.

15. At all relevant times, Defendant had the ability, right, and legal responsibility to maintain the Property, including the Tree and the Hazardous Branch, in a reasonably safe condition so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to lawful users of the adjacent public sidewalk, including Plaintiff.

16. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately midday, Plaintiff was lawfully walking along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA, carrying grocery bags.

17. The weather conditions at the time consisted of a fairly normal summer thunderstorm; there were no extraordinary weather phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, or other highly unusual events, and there were no tornado warnings or other extreme weather alerts in effect.

18. While Plaintiff was walking on the sidewalk directly adjacent to the Property, the Hazardous Branch suddenly broke off from the Tree and fell onto Plaintiff.

19. The Hazardous Branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, knocked her to the ground, and caused her to fall while she was carrying grocery bags.

20. As a direct and proximate result of being struck by the falling branch, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, as well as resulting pain, discomfort, and limitations on her daily activities.

21. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought and received medical treatment for her injuries.

22. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for evaluation, treatment, and follow-up related to her shoulder strain and bruising.

23. Because of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work at her retail job for approximately one week.

24. Plaintiff lost approximately $500 in wages due to her inability to work during that period.

25. Plaintiff has experienced and continues to experience pain, soreness, stiffness, and discomfort in her shoulder and back as a result of the incident.

26. Plaintiff also suffered inconvenience, emotional distress, and disruption of her normal life, including limitations in lifting, reaching, and other routine tasks, during her period of recovery.

27. The hazardous condition of the Tree and the Hazardous Branch was not open and obvious in a way that would have enabled Plaintiff to avoid the risk by changing her path of travel, particularly because the branch was directly above the only sidewalk path and its precise risk of imminent failure was not reasonably apparent to an ordinary pedestrian passing underneath.

28. The presence, for a significant period, of a visibly cracked and drooping branch over a public sidewalk was a dangerous condition that made unreasonable the risk of harm to Plaintiff and other pedestrians.

29. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the hazardous nature of the Tree and the Hazardous Branch, and that the condition created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of physical harm to pedestrians lawfully using the sidewalk adjacent to 123 Maple Street.

30. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, maintain, repair, or remove the Tree or the Hazardous Branch, and failed to warn pedestrians such as Plaintiff of the danger posed by the Hazardous Branch.

31. The falling of the Hazardous Branch during an ordinary, foreseeable summer thunderstorm was a manifestation of the long-standing defective condition of the Tree that Defendant had actual and constructive notice of prior to August 15, 2023.

32. Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain the Tree and Hazardous Branch in a reasonably safe condition and to protect lawful users of the adjacent sidewalk from foreseeable harm.

                           IV. CAUSE OF ACTION
                              (Negligence)

33. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 32 above as if fully set forth herein.

34. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner owes a duty to all lawful visitors to the property, and to persons foreseeably using adjacent public ways, to exercise reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury, the probable seriousness of such injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708–09 (1973); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

35. This duty of reasonable care extends to the maintenance of trees and structures on private property that may foreseeably fall or shed limbs onto neighboring property or public ways and cause injury. See Ferragamo v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 395 Mass. 581, 583–84 (1985) (duty regarding tree limbs overhanging adjacent property); Bernier v. Boston Edison Co., 380 Mass. 372, 378–79 (1980) (duty to anticipate reasonably foreseeable consequences of conditions adjacent to public ways).

36. Massachusetts law recognizes that an owner or person in control of land must act as a reasonable person in maintaining property in a safe condition, including remedying or warning about hazards of which the owner knows or should know through the exercise of reasonable care. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 371–72 (2010); O’Sullivan v. Shaw, 431 Mass. 201, 204–05 (2000).

37. A property owner is liable for harm caused by a defective condition on the property where the owner knew or reasonably should have known of the condition and unreasonably failed to correct it or to warn others. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 784–85 (2007); Oliveri v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

38. Defendant, as the owner and person in control of 123 Maple Street, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the inspection, maintenance, and repair of the Tree and Hazardous Branch that overhung the sidewalk and posed a foreseeable risk to pedestrians.

39. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent the Tree and its branches from constituting a dangerous condition to individuals lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk, and to warn of or correct any such dangerous conditions upon actual or constructive notice. See Whittaker v. Saraceno, 418 Mass. 196, 198–200 (1994); Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 400 Mass. 837, 842 (1987).

40. Defendant had actual notice of the hazardous condition of the Tree and the Hazardous Branch, as evidenced by the visible cracking and drooping of the branch and the specific complaints and warnings from neighbors prior to the incident, as well as Defendant’s own statement that he would “deal with it in the spring.”

41. Independently of actual notice, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazardous condition, because the defective nature of the Hazardous Branch existed for a sufficient period of time and was sufficiently apparent that a reasonably prudent property owner, in the exercise of ordinary care, would have discovered the condition through reasonable inspection. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 785–86; Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

42. Having actual and/or constructive notice of the hazardous condition, Defendant was obligated to take reasonable steps to remedy the danger or otherwise protect foreseeable pedestrians, including Plaintiff, from harm. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154–55 (2013); Black v. Coastal Oil New England, Inc., 45 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 463–64 (1998).

43. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care in one or more of the following ways, among others:

    a. Failing to properly inspect the Tree and the Hazardous Branch despite visible indications of damage and instability;

    b. Failing to hire a qualified arborist or professional to evaluate the Tree and Hazardous Branch after being alerted to the danger by neighbors;

    c. Failing to prune, reinforce, remove, or otherwise correct the Hazardous Branch despite actual and constructive notice of its dangerous condition;

    d. Allowing a visibly cracked and drooping branch to continue to overhang the public sidewalk for an unreasonable period of time;

    e. Failing to warn pedestrians, including Plaintiff, of the danger posed by the Hazardous Branch;

    f. Failing to restrict access to or around the area under the Hazardous Branch once the danger was or should have been recognized; and

    g. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

44. The occurrence of the branch falling during a typical summer thunderstorm, which is a foreseeable and common weather event in Massachusetts, does not absolve Defendant of liability because:

    a. The dangerous condition of the Tree and the Hazardous Branch pre-existed the storm and was known or knowable to Defendant; and

    b. Reasonable care requires landowners to anticipate and guard against the effects of ordinary foreseeable weather conditions on known defective structures or trees. See Bernier, 380 Mass. at 378–79; Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978).

45. To the extent Defendant may assert that the falling branch was solely the result of an “act of God,” such a defense is inapplicable where the defendant’s negligence has combined with foreseeable natural forces to produce the harm. See, e.g., Rugo v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 12 Mass. App. Ct. 431, 434–35 (1981) (landowner liability where natural conditions interact with negligent maintenance).

46. Any contention that the danger was “open and obvious” does not bar Plaintiff’s recovery because:

    a. The precise risk of sudden limb failure under the prevailing weather conditions was not obvious to an ordinary pedestrian; and

    b. Even where a danger is open and obvious, a landowner may remain liable when it is foreseeable that lawful visitors will nonetheless encounter the hazard in the course of their ordinary use of the premises and there are reasonable steps that the landowner could and should take to prevent harm. See Dos Santos, 465 Mass. at 154–56; Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 336–38 (2010).

47. Plaintiff at all times acted as a reasonably prudent person using the public sidewalk for its intended and ordinary purpose, and did not contribute negligently to the creation of the hazardous condition.

48. To the extent any negligence might be attributed to Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was less than the negligence of Defendant, and Plaintiff’s claim is therefore not barred under Massachusetts’ comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85. See Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 62–63 (1988).

49. Defendant’s breaches of duty, as set forth above, were a direct and proximate cause of the branch’s failure and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages. The harm suffered by Plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to address the known hazardous condition of the Tree and Hazardous Branch.

50. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following injuries and damages:

    a. A shoulder strain and multiple bruises;

    b. Physical pain, soreness, and discomfort;

    c. Emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience associated with the incident and recovery;

    d. Approximately $1,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses;

    e. Approximately $500 in lost wages from her retail employment due to an inability to work for about one week;

    f. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with her usual activities during recovery; and

    g. Such other and further general and special damages as may be shown at trial.

51. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all past and future damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, lost earnings, pain and suffering, and other general damages. See, e.g., G.L. c. 231, §§ 60F, 85; doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 367 Mass. 776, 787–88 (1975).

                           V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Harmon respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Richards, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be well in excess of $25,000, for:

   1. Past and future medical expenses, including the approximately $1,200 already incurred and any additional amounts that may reasonably be incurred for treatment of Plaintiff’s injuries;

   2. Past and future lost wages and impairment of earning capacity, including the approximately $500 already lost in wages due to Plaintiff’s inability to work for about one week;

   3. Past and future physical pain and suffering;

   4. Emotional distress, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life;

   5. Any and all other general and special damages proven at trial.

B. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on all damages awarded, as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

C. Costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable court costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 261, §§ 1 et seq.

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                            VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including Mass. R. Civ. P. 38.

                                     Respectfully submitted,

                                     Plaintiff,
