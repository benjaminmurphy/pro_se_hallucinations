COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
BERKSHIRE DIVISION

DOCKET NO. ____________  

JESSICA TURNER,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL TURNER,  
 Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody / Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, resides in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. She is the biological mother of the minor child, Emily Turner (born __________, age 12).

2. The Defendant, Michael Turner (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. He is the biological father of the minor child, Emily Turner.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Emily Turner (“the Child”), who is subject to the custody and parenting orders at issue in this Complaint for Modification.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6 and G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, and 31, as this is a proceeding to modify an existing judgment of custody and parenting time concerning a minor child of the parties.

5. Venue is proper in the Berkshire Probate and Family Court because the prior custody order was issued by this Court and the parties and child reside within the Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 208, § 6 and related venue provisions.

6. The existing custody and parenting order was entered by the Berkshire Probate and Family Court on May 15, 2018 (the “2018 Judgment” or “existing order”).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT

7. The 2018 Judgment awarded the parties shared legal custody of the Child and a 50/50 physical custody / parenting time arrangement, consisting of alternating weeks, one week on and one week off, with exchanges occurring weekly.

8. At the time of the 2018 Judgment, both parties lived in reasonably close proximity to one another, both were in good health, both were fully able to meet the Child’s day‑to‑day physical and emotional needs, and the alternating week-on/week-off arrangement was in the Child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

9. For several years after entry of the 2018 Judgment, the shared physical custody arrangement functioned well:  
   a. The Child maintained stable routines in both homes.  
   b. The Child’s schooling, health, and extracurricular activities were adequately supported by both parents.  
   c. The parties were each able to provide basic care, supervision, and a safe home environment for the Child.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the Child, specifically related to Father’s serious and progressive health condition. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635 (1999).

11. Recently, Father has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that substantially limits his mobility, balance, and physical functioning.

12. As a result of this condition, Father uses a wheelchair for mobility at least part of the time and experiences episodes of weakness, instability, and impaired balance.

13. Father has fallen multiple times in his home, including times when the Child has been present.

14. Upon information and belief, Father’s treating medical providers have advised that:  
   a. Father is at heightened risk of falls, particularly around stairs or uneven surfaces;  
   b. Father should not be independently responsible for physically demanding or emergent tasks involving a minor child; and  
   c. Father should avoid situations where quick physical response is required to keep a child safe (for example, in the vicinity of stairs, bathrooms, kitchens with hot surfaces, and outdoor environments with fall hazards).

15. Notwithstanding these medical limitations and safety concerns, Father insists on maintaining the exact same 50/50 alternating week-on/week-off physical custody schedule that was put in place when he was fully able-bodied.

16. During Father’s parenting time, the Child, who is twelve (12) years old, has been required or expected at times to:  
   a. Assist Father in transferring from his wheelchair to his bed, couch, and/or other furniture;  
   b. Retrieve food, medication, or other necessary items for Father when he is unable to move safely or easily; and  
   c. Provide assistance that is physically and emotionally burdensome and inappropriate for a child of her age.

17. Father’s falls and limited mobility present safety concerns for the Child in areas requiring quick reaction time, such as:  
   a. Navigating stairs in the home or building;  
   b. Bathing and bathroom use, where the risk of slips and falls is heightened;  
   c. Responding to emergencies such as a fire, a medical crisis, or the Child’s potential accidents; and  
   d. Managing outdoor activities (crossing streets, getting in and out of vehicles, or being in public spaces with uneven terrain or obstacles).

18. Father’s progressive neurological condition is, by its nature, expected to worsen over time, thereby increasing the risk that he may be unable to respond quickly or adequately to the Child’s needs in an emergency.

19. The Child has expressed anxiety and emotional distress related to Father’s physical limitations, his falls, and the expectation that she help with his care, which she experiences as frightening and stressful.

20. The existing shared physical custody arrangement—predicated on both parents being physically able to independently and safely care for the Child—no longer reflects the reality of Father’s capabilities or the Child’s safety needs.

21. These developments constitute a clear and material change in circumstances since the entry of the 2018 Judgment, as contemplated by G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law. See, e.g.:  
   a. Custody of Vaughan, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (material change and best interests standard govern modification);  
   b. Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (changes affecting child’s welfare justify modification);  
   c. Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (substantial change and child’s welfare at core of analysis);  
   d. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests are paramount).

22. Continued adherence to the 50/50, week-on/week-off physical custody arrangement places the Child at unnecessary physical risk and creates an inappropriate caregiving burden on her, which is inconsistent with her best interests.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. In any custody or parenting time determination or modification, the Court’s guiding standard is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

24. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must consider, among other factors:  
   a. The child’s present and past living conditions;  
   b. The child’s relationship with each parent;  
   c. The willingness and ability of each parent to provide for the child’s needs; and  
   d. The child’s physical and emotional well-being and safety.

25. Massachusetts appellate courts have repeatedly held that a parenting arrangement that may once have been in a child’s best interests may require modification when circumstances materially change. See:  
   a. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998);  
   b. Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635 (1999);  
   c. Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   d. Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).

26. Father’s progressive neurological condition impairs his physical ability to:  
   a. Supervise the Child safely in circumstances where quick physical intervention may be needed;  
   b. Respond effectively to emergencies or dangerous situations; and  
   c. Perform certain physical caregiving tasks without assistance from another competent adult.

27. A central component of the best‑interests analysis is the child’s safety and security. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); Adoption of Bianca, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 428 (2017). A parenting plan that compromises a child’s physical safety or places undue caregiving responsibility on the child is inconsistent with those principles.

28. The Child’s emotional needs also must be considered. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996). The Child’s anxiety and emotional distress caused by:  
   a. Witnessing Father’s falls;  
   b. Being asked to assist in physically moving Father; and  
   c. Feeling responsible for Father’s well‑being,  
   are detrimental to her emotional development and sense of security.

29. The current arrangement effectively makes the Child a regular caregiver for Father, creating a role reversal that is contrary to her welfare and best interests.

30. The requested modification—to grant Mother primary physical custody, with appropriate and safe parenting time for Father calibrated to his abilities and medical situation—would:  
   a. Reduce the risk of physical harm to the Child;  
   b. Alleviate the emotional burden and anxiety the Child experiences as a de facto caregiver;  
   c. Preserve and support the Child’s relationship with Father in a manner that is safe and sustainable; and  
   d. Provide the Child a more stable and secure day‑to‑day environment.

31. The requested modification is also consistent with G.L. c. 119, § 1, which expresses the Commonwealth’s policy of protecting children from harm and securing for them a stable and safe home environment.

32. The modification sought does not seek to sever or unduly limit the Child’s relationship with Father; rather, it aims to structure that relationship in a way that recognizes Father’s medical limitations and prioritizes the Child’s safety and emotional well‑being.

### VI. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

33. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a judgment relative to custody or parenting time “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

34. Massachusetts case law establishes that modification of custody or parenting time requires:  
   a. A material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment; and  
   b. Proof that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635 (1999); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

35. A parent’s significantly changed health status and reduced physical capacity to safely provide care and supervision constitute a material change in circumstances justifying reconsideration of physical custody and parenting time. See analogous reasoning in Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (focus on child’s welfare and parental capacity) and Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

36. Applied here, Father’s progressive neurological condition and its documented impact on his physical functioning, mobility, and safety, combined with the Child’s increased caregiving role and emotional distress, meet the “material and substantial change” requirement.

37. The modification sought by Mother promotes the Child’s best interests by:  
   a. Ensuring that the Child’s primary residence is with the parent who can currently provide consistent physical safety without reliance on the Child as a caregiver;  
   b. Allowing Father continued meaningful parenting time under conditions that are safe for both him and the Child; and  
   c. Providing a structure that anticipates Father’s progressive limitations and reduces the likelihood of repeated court intervention.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

38. Mother requests that the Court modify the 2018 Judgment to award her primary physical custody of the Child, with the parties continuing to share legal custody to the extent consistent with the Child’s best interests.

39. Mother further requests that the Court establish a parenting plan for Father that:  
   a. Provides Father with reasonable and meaningful parenting time, taking into account his medical condition and mobility limitations;  
   b. Avoids placing the Child in situations where she is expected or required to provide physical assistance with Father’s transfers, mobility, or personal care;  
   c. Limits or conditions Father’s time alone with the Child in circumstances where quick physical response is likely to be needed for the Child’s safety (e.g., around stairs, in hazardous environments) unless appropriate adult support is available; and  
   d. Encourages the parties to adjust the schedule, by agreement, as Father’s condition and the Child’s needs evolve, subject to the Court’s continuing jurisdiction.

40. Mother is willing and able to facilitate and encourage a close and loving relationship between the Child and Father, including but not limited to:  
   a. Liberal telephone, video, and electronic contact between the Child and Father; and  
   b. Additional in‑person visits, holidays, and special occasions as may be mutually agreed upon, provided such visits are safe and appropriate given Father’s medical status.

41. Mother further requests that the modified order include any additional terms the Court deems necessary to protect the Child’s physical and emotional safety, including but not limited to:  
   a. Requirements that Father follow his treating physician’s recommendations regarding safety and physical limitations when the Child is in his care;  
   b. Provisions permitting review of the parenting plan if Father’s condition significantly worsens or materially improves; and  
   c. Such other safeguards as are in the Child’s best interests.

### VIII. COUNT I  
Modification of Custody and Parenting Time  
(G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31)

42. Mother realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 41 as though fully set forth herein.

43. There has been a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties and the Child since the entry of the 2018 Judgment, specifically Father’s diagnosis with and progression of a serious neurological condition that substantially limits his ability safely to care for the Child without assistance and that has led to the Child acting as a caregiver.

44. The existing 50/50 shared physical custody arrangement no longer serves the Child’s best interests in light of Father’s physical limitations, the safety risks in his home environment, and the emotional burden placed on the Child.

45. It is in the Child’s best interests that Mother be awarded primary physical custody and that Father’s parenting time be modified to reflect what he can safely manage in light of his medical condition, while maintaining and fostering the Child’s relationship with Father.

46. Modification of the existing custody order is warranted and necessary pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, G.L. c. 215, § 6, and the controlling decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court, including but not limited to:  
   a. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998);  
   b. Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635 (1999);  
   c. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   d. Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   e. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   f. Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015);  
   g. Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998);  
   h. Adoption of Bianca, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 428 (2017);  
   i. G.L. c. 119, § 1 (child safety and welfare policy); and  
   j. G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 (custody and modification standards).

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. FIND that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2018 custody and parenting time order;

2. FIND that modification of the current 50/50 shared physical custody arrangement is in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Turner;

3. MODIFY the existing judgment to award the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Turner, with shared legal custody unless the Court determines otherwise;

4. ESTABLISH a revised parenting plan for the Defendant, Michael Turner, that provides reasonable and meaningful parenting time consistent with his medical condition and the Child’s safety and emotional needs, including appropriate conditions or limitations necessary to protect the Child from physical risk and inappropriate caregiving burdens;

5. ORDER that the parties comply with any safeguards the Court deems necessary with respect to Father’s adherence to medical recommendations and safety measures when the Child is in his care;

6. RETAIN jurisdiction to make such further orders as may be necessary regarding custody, parenting time, and related matters as circumstances evolve;

7. AWARD such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,

PLAINTIFF,
