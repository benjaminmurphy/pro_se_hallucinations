v.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Rogers (date of birth: __________, age 9).

2. The Defendant, Michael Rogers (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Rogers.

3. The minor child, Ethan Rogers, age 9, is the subject of this Complaint for Modification and presently resides primarily with the Mother, in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 215, §§ 3, 6 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as incorporated in custody and parenting matters, and under G.L. c. 209C, § 10 (as applicable to custody and parenting time for children born outside of marriage), as the child and the parties reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the child resides primarily within Bristol County and the existing custody and parenting-time orders were issued by this Court.

### III. PRIOR ORDER

6. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “Existing Custody Order”) providing, in substance, that:
   a. The parties share joint legal custody of Ethan; and  
   b. Ethan’s primary residence is with the Mother; and  
   c. The Father has parenting time with Ethan on designated weekends (including overnights) and as otherwise set forth in the Existing Custody Order.

7. The Existing Custody Order was based on the facts and circumstances then before the Court, including the Court’s determination that both parents were stable, that each could provide a safe and appropriate environment for the child, and that the parties were capable of effective co‑parenting.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the Existing Custody Order on September 15, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of Ethan, such that a modification of the Existing Custody Order is necessary and appropriate. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10(b); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

9. In or about the past several months, Ethan has repeatedly reported to Mother that there are “special drinks” at Father’s home and that Father sometimes “can’t walk straight” when caring for him.

10. Ethan has further stated that these incidents occur at times when he is in Father’s care, including evenings associated with his weekend overnights.

11. A neighbor familiar with the parties and with the existing custody arrangements provided Mother with a video recording depicting Father stumbling and appearing unsteady while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night and escorting him toward Father’s residence.

12. Upon information and belief, the video was taken during one of Father’s weekend overnights with Ethan, and it appears that Father was impaired—by alcohol or another substance—while responsible for the care and supervision of the minor child.

13. Mother has observed that, following Ethan’s weekends with Father, Ethan routinely appears unusually exhausted on Monday mornings, to the point that school staff have raised concerns about his level of fatigue at the start of the school week.

14. Ethan’s school has communicated to Mother that Ethan frequently appears significantly tired, unfocused, or low‑energy on Monday mornings, which is directly after his weekend parenting time with Father, and that this pattern is impacting his classroom attention and participation.

15. Upon information and belief, Father’s consumption of alcohol and/or other intoxicating substances during his parenting time, including during evening and overnight hours, is exposing Ethan to an unsafe and unstable environment, and is inconsistent with the expectations reasonably underlying the Existing Custody Order.

16. At the time of the September 15, 2021 order, the Court understood both parties to be stable, non‑impaired caregivers who could safely and appropriately provide overnight care for the child. Father’s current pattern of apparent impairment and unsafe behavior while caring for Ethan is a significant departure from those assumptions and conditions.

17. The reported incidents—Ethan’s statements about “special drinks” and Father not being able to “walk straight,” the neighbor’s video evidence of Father stumbling while handling the child late at night, and the school’s concerns about Ethan’s exhaustion—collectively demonstrate a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Custody Order.

18. These changed circumstances directly implicate the safety, emotional well‑being, and best interests of Ethan and render the Existing Custody Order no longer appropriate without modification. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

19. Mother is genuinely and reasonably concerned that Father’s apparent use of alcohol and/or other impairing substances during parenting time compromises his ability to safely supervise Ethan, to provide adequate nighttime care, and to respond to any emergencies that may arise.

20. Mother’s concerns are made in good faith and are based on specific observations, repeated statements from the child, concerns raised by school personnel, and corroborative video evidence, not on speculation, animosity, or a desire to interfere with Father’s relationship with Ethan.

21. Mother acknowledges and supports Ethan’s relationship with Father, and she does not seek to terminate Father’s relationship with Ethan. Rather, she seeks reasonable conditions and/or supervision of overnights to ensure that Ethan’s safety and best interests are protected. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

22. The pattern of reported and observed impairment and the resulting impact on Ethan’s rest, school readiness, and sense of safety constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of the prior custody/parenting‑time order. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. Under Massachusetts law, custody and parenting‑time determinations must be governed by the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a); Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

24. The best‑interest standard includes consideration of the child’s safety, emotional growth, happiness, and stability, as well as each parent’s capacity to provide day‑to‑day care, meet the child’s needs, and refrain from conduct that endangers or undermines the child’s well‑being. See Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755 (1983); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

25. A parent’s misuse of alcohol or other substances during periods of responsibility for a child, especially during overnight care, presents a significant risk to the child’s physical safety and emotional security and is contrary to the child’s best interests. See Adoption of Greta, 431 Mass. 577 (2000); Adoption of Helen, 429 Mass. 856 (1999).

26. The reported exhaustion and reduced functioning Ethan displays at school following weekends with Father demonstrate that the current overnight arrangement is adversely affecting Ethan’s rest, daily functioning, and educational experience, which are central to his best interests. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).

27. While maintaining a relationship with both parents is generally in a child’s best interests, such contact must occur in a manner that is safe and developmentally appropriate. Parenting time may be conditioned or structured, including through supervision or specific restrictions, when necessary to protect a child. See R.H. v. B.F., 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (1995); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

28. The modifications sought by Mother are narrowly tailored to address the identified safety concerns—specifically, Father’s apparent impairment and its effect on Ethan’s welfare—while still allowing Father to maintain an ongoing relationship with the child, consistent with Massachusetts law and policy favoring frequent and continuing contact with both parents when safe. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a).

29. Given the nature of the concerns, conditions on Father’s parenting time are appropriate and necessary, including (but not limited to) restrictions on alcohol or drug use during and immediately prior to parenting time, possible supervised overnights, and/or restructuring of parenting time to avoid overnights until Father demonstrates sustained sobriety and reliability in caring for the child.

### VI. BASIS IN LAW FOR MODIFICATION

30. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and, as applicable, G.L. c. 209C, § 10(b)), this Court may modify a custody or parenting‑time judgment upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances and (2) that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

31. The material and substantial change in circumstances here includes:  
   a. Father’s apparent intoxication and/or impairment while caring for Ethan, as reported by Ethan and observed on video;  
   b. Ethan’s repeated statements that Father uses “special drinks” and has difficulty walking straight during parenting time;  
   c. The school’s concerns that Ethan is consistently exhausted and less functional on Monday mornings immediately following weekends in Father’s care; and  
   d. The overall erosion of the assumptions of safety, stability, and sobriety that underpinned the Existing Custody Order.

32. These changes directly affect Ethan’s physical safety, emotional security, and educational functioning, thereby satisfying the legal requirement that a modification be supported by changed circumstances affecting the child’s welfare. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002).

33. The requested modification—imposing supervision and/or conditions on Father’s overnights and parenting time—is reasonably calculated to protect Ethan’s best interests while preserving his relationship with Father and is consistent with the authority of this Court to fashion parenting‑time arrangements that protect a child from potential harm. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); R.H. v. B.F., 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (1995).

34. To the extent the Existing Custody Order contemplates unsupervised overnight parenting time with Father without conditions regarding alcohol or substance use, that order is no longer in Ethan’s best interests in light of the current circumstances and should be modified accordingly. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

35. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Custody Order dated September 15, 2021, and that modification is necessary to serve Ethan’s best interests.

36. Mother specifically requests that the Court modify the Existing Custody Order as follows (subject to the Court’s further orders and discretion):

   a. That Mother, Jessica Thompson, remain Ethan’s primary physical custodian, with Ethan’s primary residence to continue with Mother.

   b. That the parties’ shared legal custody be maintained or adjusted as the Court deems appropriate, with Mother having final decision‑making authority regarding issues of health, safety, and education in the event of disagreement, to protect Ethan’s welfare.

   c. That all of Father’s overnights with Ethan be suspended, or in the alternative be supervised by an agreed‑upon, neutral, and responsible third party or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, until such time as Father demonstrates to the Court that he can safely care for Ethan overnight without impairment.

   d. That Father’s parenting time with Ethan be modified to daytime visits only (for example, Saturdays and/or Sundays during daylight hours) and specifically without overnights, unless and until further order of the Court.

   e. That Father be ordered to refrain from consuming alcohol, marijuana, or any non‑prescribed controlled substances during parenting time and for at least twenty‑four (24) hours prior to the commencement of each parenting‑time period.

   f. That the Court may require Father to submit to random and/or scheduled alcohol and/or drug testing as the Court deems appropriate, with positive tests or failures to test to result in immediate re‑evaluation of his parenting time.

   g. That Father be ordered to complete, at the Court’s discretion, an alcohol and/or substance‑use evaluation with a qualified professional and to follow all recommended treatment or counseling, with proof of compliance to be provided to Mother and/or the Court.

   h. That the Court enter any additional safety‑related conditions it deems necessary regarding transportation of the child, pick‑up and drop‑off procedures, and Father’s conduct during parenting time, including but not limited to prohibitions on driving with the child after consuming alcohol or other impairing substances.

   i. That the Court schedule this matter for a prompt case management conference and evidentiary hearing on Mother’s Complaint for Modification, and that any appropriate temporary orders be entered pending final determination.

   j. That the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper in order to protect the best interests, safety, and welfare of Ethan Rogers.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Custody Order dated September 15, 2021;

2. Find that modification of the Existing Custody Order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Rogers;

3. Modify the Existing Custody Order to suspend or condition Father’s overnight parenting time, including by:
   a. Imposing supervised overnights or, in the alternative,  
   b. Restricting Father’s parenting time to daytime visits only, without overnights, until further order of the Court;

4. Impose reasonable conditions on Father’s parenting time, including but not limited to restrictions on alcohol and drug use, possible testing, and requirements for evaluation and treatment, as set forth above;

5. Maintain Ethan’s primary physical residence with Mother and confirm or adjust legal custody as the Court deems appropriate to safeguard Ethan’s welfare;

6. Schedule and hold an evidentiary hearing on this Complaint for Modification and issue any appropriate temporary orders pending final judgment; and

7. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
Jessica Thompson,
