The only reference to an amount of money relates to attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, not to compensable personal injury damages. Accordingly, it does not provide authority for the proposition cited.",

This provision of the decree follows the phraseology of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444. That amount was awarded for legal services and expenses rendered in connection with the certification from the board to the Superior Court."

Chin is a medical malpractice and damages case, but the quoted pages (702\u201303) deal with negligence and causation standards, not with the categories of recoverable damages. The opinion elsewhere discusses damages structure (e.g., collateral source offsets, charitable cap, life expectancy, future medical expenses), yet it does not set out the general rule that a plaintiff is entitled to recover past and future pain and suffering, medical expenses, wage loss, and loss of earning capacity. Thus, it is not appropriate authority for the broad remedial proposition cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The plaintiff has met the burden of proving that the defendants' negligence caused the harm he actually suffered.... The medical practitioners would have the plaintiff undergo X-rays... would have the plaintiff undergo a CAT scan.... Early surgical intervention would probably have been successful in preventing quadriplegia.\" (405 Mass. at 702\u201303). This discussion concerns causation, not the categories of recoverable damages."
