EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Docket No. __________

DAVID SMITH,  
    Defendant.  
________________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
________________________________________  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, self‑represented, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and may be contacted for purposes of this action at telephone number (617) 555‑0123 and email address psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, David Smith (“Father”), is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

3. The minor child who is the subject of this action is:

   - Sophie Smith, born __________, age 10 (hereinafter “Sophie” or “the Child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Complaint pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31; G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (if applicable), and the Court’s general equity powers in matters of custody and parenting time.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody and parenting‑time order was entered in this Court on or about May 15, 2016, and the parties and child reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about May 15, 2016, this Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary Order merged into a final judgment) concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time for the Child (the “2016 Judgment”).

7. Under the 2016 Judgment, primary residence/primary physical custody of the Child was awarded to Father, with Mother having limited parenting time consisting primarily of:

   a. Visitation on limited weekends; and  
   b. One weeknight dinner visit each week, without an overnight.

8. At the time of the 2016 Judgment, Mother:

   a. Was enrolled as a full‑time graduate student;  
   b. Lived in a small studio apartment not well‑suited to frequent or extended overnight parenting time; and  
   c. Had a demanding and inflexible academic and work schedule, which limited her ability to exercise more parenting time.

9. The limited parenting schedule set forth in the 2016 Judgment was based substantially on those then‑existing circumstances and constraints in Mother’s life, and on the Child’s very young age at that time (approximately four years old).

### IV. STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

10. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Probate and Family Court may revise and modify a judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

11. The best interests of the child is the “paramount” and governing standard in all custody and parenting‑time determinations and modifications in Massachusetts. See, e.g.:

   - Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985);  
   - Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003);  
   - Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 766–67 (1983).

12. A party seeking modification of a prior custody or parenting‑time order must show a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the last judgment, and that modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g.:

   - Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981);  
   - Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899–900 (1981);  
   - Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996).

13. In assessing the child’s best interests, the Court considers all relevant factors, including but not limited to: the child’s age and developmental needs; the child’s relationship with each parent; the stability of each parent’s home; each parent’s ability to meet the child’s emotional, educational, and physical needs; the parties’ willingness to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent; and, where appropriate, the child’s own preferences, with due regard to the child’s age and maturity. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 231–33 (1998).

14. Massachusetts law recognizes that a child’s well‑reasoned and voluntary preferences about parenting time may be considered, particularly for an older child, as one factor among many in determining best interests. See, e.g., Adoption of a Minor, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 993, 994 (1984); Adoption of Vito, 431 Mass. 550, 564–66 (2000).

### V. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

15. Since the entry of the 2016 Judgment, there has been a material, substantial, and continuing change in the circumstances of Mother and of the Child that was not anticipated at the time of the original order, and that warrants modification to provide the Child with increased and more regular parenting time with Mother.

#### A. Mother’s Completion of Graduate School and Stable Employment

16. At the time of the 2016 Judgment, Mother was in graduate school with an inflexible and demanding schedule that limited her availability for parenting time, especially during weekdays and overnights.

17. Since that time, Mother has successfully completed her graduate education.

18. Mother is now employed in a stable job with normal, predictable work hours, enabling her to be regularly available before and after school, in the evenings, and on weekends to care for the Child.

19. Mother’s changed work and educational status represents a significant and positive change in circumstances, improving her ability to meet the Child’s day‑to‑day needs, to maintain routines, and to provide a stable caregiving presence. See, e.g., Schuler, 382 Mass. at 369–70 (change in financial and employment situation can support modification); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 190 (1998) (stability and predictability are important to children’s best interests).

#### B. Mother’s Improved Housing and Living Situation

20. At the time of the 2016 Judgment, Mother lived in a small studio apartment that the Court reasonably considered less suitable for frequent or extended overnight parenting time with a four‑year‑old child.

21. Mother has since obtained and now resides in a two‑bedroom apartment that provides a safe, appropriate, and stable home environment for the Child.

22. The Child has her own bedroom at Mother’s home, with appropriate furniture and space for her belongings, schoolwork, and personal items.

23. The improved housing arrangement constitutes a material and positive change in circumstances relevant to the Child’s physical comfort, privacy, and emotional security, and supports an increase in overnights and overall parenting time with Mother. See, e.g., Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 403–04 (1981) (examining adequacy of home environment and living arrangements as part of best‑interest analysis).

#### C. The Child’s Age and Developmental Needs

24. At the time of the 2016 Judgment, the Child was approximately four (4) years old, a very young age where the Court reasonably fashioned a conservative parenting plan based on her developmental stage and the parents’ then‑current circumstances.

25. The Child is now ten (10) years old, of school age, and significantly more mature, with evolving emotional, social, and educational needs.

26. As children grow, their best interests can require different parenting schedules, routines, and contact with each parent than those that were appropriate when they were much younger. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43 (recognizing that passage of time and children’s maturing needs can be relevant to modification); Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–39.

27. The Child’s current developmental stage allows her to handle and benefit from more frequent and extended overnight parenting time with Mother without disruption to her schooling or routine.

#### D. Strengthened Parent‑Child Relationship and Emotional Needs

28. Since the 2016 Judgment, Mother and the Child have significantly strengthened their bond and relationship.

29. Mother has consistently exercised all parenting time awarded to her, maintained regular contact, participated in the Child’s activities, and supported the Child’s educational and emotional needs.

30. The Child is engaged with a therapist. According to the Child’s therapist (as reported to Mother), the Child expresses sadness and guilt when she has to leave Mother after short visits and feels that the existing schedule does not allow adequate time with Mother.

31. The therapist has indicated that the Child desires more time and more overnights with Mother, and that the Child feels distressed about the brief nature of the current visits.

32. The Child has independently written a letter to the Court expressing her desire for additional overnights and more time in Mother’s home.

33. The Child’s stated wishes are consistent, voluntary, and reflect a thoughtful desire for a closer and more continuous relationship with Mother. In light of her age (10) and maturity, the Child’s preferences are a relevant factor in determining her best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Adoption of Vito, 431 Mass. at 564–66; Adoption of a Minor, 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 994.

34. The current limited parenting schedule is increasingly at odds with the Child’s emotional needs, her expressed preferences, and her strong bond with Mother.

#### E. Father’s Refusal to Consider Reasonable Adjustment

35. Mother has attempted to address these changes and the Child’s needs informally by discussing a revised schedule with Father.

36. Father has refused to discuss any meaningful changes to the parenting schedule and becomes angry when the Child raises the subject of spending more time with Mother.

37. Father’s unwillingness even to consider reasonable adjustments in light of the Child’s wishes and the substantial positive changes in Mother’s circumstances has necessitated Mother’s filing of this Complaint for Modification.

38. A parent’s willingness and ability to foster the Child’s relationship with the other parent is a significant factor in assessing the best interests of the child. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844; Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05.

39. Given the material and substantial changes in circumstances—including Mother’s completion of graduate school, stable employment and schedule, improved housing with a bedroom for the Child, the Child’s older age and developmental stage, the strengthening of the mother‑child relationship, and the Child’s own stated desire for more time with Mother—continuation of the 2016 Judgment’s very limited parenting‑time provisions is no longer in the Child’s best interests.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

40. Under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, the Court must fashion custody and parenting‑time orders that serve the Child’s best interests.

41. The material changes set forth above all weigh in favor of providing the Child with significantly increased and consistent parenting time, including overnights, with Mother in order to:

   a. Support and nurture the strong and positive bond between Mother and the Child;  
   b. Address the Child’s expressed emotional needs and alleviate her feelings of sadness and guilt associated with short visits;  
   c. Provide the Child a stable, suitable living environment in Mother’s two‑bedroom home, where she has her own room; and  
   d. Promote the Child’s overall emotional, social, and developmental well‑being as she grows older.

42. An updated parenting plan that includes regular overnights and expanded time with Mother can be structured to avoid disruption to the Child’s schooling, activities, and established routines, given Mother’s normal work hours and stable schedule.

43. No evidence suggests that increasing Mother’s parenting time and overnights would be harmful to the Child; instead, all indications from the Child’s statements, therapeutic input, and Mother’s current circumstances show that such modification would advance the Child’s welfare. See, e.g., Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. at 231–33; Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. at 766–67.

44. Accordingly, a modification of the existing custody/parenting‑time provisions is both warranted by a material and substantial change in circumstances and required by the best interests of the Child.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

45. Mother is not, by this Complaint, asking the Court to eliminate Father’s role in the Child’s life or to disrupt the Child’s relationship with Father, but rather to adjust the parenting‑time schedule so that it better reflects:

   a. The changed and improved circumstances of Mother;  
   b. The Child’s present age and developmental needs; and  
   c. The Child’s clear desire and emotional need to spend more time and more overnights with Mother.

46. Mother respectfully requests that the Court enter a modified parenting‑time order that includes, at a minimum, the following:

   a. Regular, substantially expanded parenting time with Mother on alternate weekends from Friday after school (or at a set time on Friday) through Sunday evening;  
   b. At least one, and preferably two, weeknight overnights with Mother each week during the school year, coordinated with the Child’s school schedule;  
   c. A reasonably equal or substantially increased allocation to Mother of school vacations, holidays, and summer parenting time, in a schedule to be set by the Court or by agreement of the parties; and  
   d. Any additional provisions the Court deems appropriate to ensure that both parents foster the Child’s relationship with the other parent and to minimize conflict in transitions.

47. Mother further requests that legal custody and major decision‑making authority follow the structure previously ordered, unless and until the Court determines, after hearing, that further modification is in the Child’s best interests under the standard set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 31 and applicable case law.

48. Mother also requests that the Court consider, in its discretion, whether an interview of the Child, appointment of a guardian ad litem, or consideration of the Child’s letter to the Court is appropriate and consistent with her best interests, in light of her age and maturity, as allowed under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., Adoption of Vito, 431 Mass. at 564–66; Adoption of a Minor, 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 994.

### VIII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the May 15, 2016 Judgment concerning custody and parenting time for Sophie Smith;

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions is necessary and in the best interests of the Child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31 and applicable case law;

3. Enter a Modified Judgment that:

   a. Substantially increases Mother’s parenting time with the Child, including regular weekend and weeknight overnights, in a specific schedule to be ordered by the Court;  
   b. Provides the Child with more frequent and extended contact with Mother, including an appropriate allocation of holidays, school vacations, and summer time; and  
   c. Includes such further provisions as the Court deems necessary to promote the Child’s welfare and to ensure that both parents support the Child’s relationship with the other parent;

4. Order such temporary or interim parenting‑time arrangements as may be just and proper pending final hearing on this Complaint, if requested or deemed necessary by the Court;

5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to serve the best interests of the Child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
EMILY JOHNSON
