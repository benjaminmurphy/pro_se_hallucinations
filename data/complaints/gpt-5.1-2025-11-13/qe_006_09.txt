COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Torres (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Torres”), is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, manages, controls, and/or operates the residential rental premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. This action arises out of Defendant’s breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment implied into residential tenancies in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 21, and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this action concerns residential rental property located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and the amount in controversy is within the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 2 because the Premises are located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts (the “Apartment” or “Rental Unit”).

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment as her primary residence from on or about January 1, 2022, through the present.

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00, which Plaintiff has paid, or has been ready, willing, and able to pay, in return for a habitable dwelling with essential services, including hot water.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the owner, landlord, and/or person in control of the Premises and is responsible for maintaining the Apartment in compliance with Massachusetts law, including the State Sanitary Code and the implied warranty of habitability.

10. Pursuant to the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190, a landlord is required to provide adequate hot water to tenants, meeting the temperature and availability requirements set forth in the regulation.

11. Adequate and continuous hot water is an essential service and a basic requirement of a habitable residential dwelling under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

12. On or about early November 2025, approximately three weeks before the date of this Complaint, the hot water service in Plaintiff’s Apartment failed.

13. As of the filing date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025, Plaintiff has been without functioning hot water in the Apartment for approximately three consecutive weeks.

14. Plaintiff discovered the loss of hot water immediately and, on the same day, promptly notified Defendant that there was no hot water in the Apartment.

15. Defendant responded that the water heater needed a part and represented that he had ordered the part.

16. Approximately one week after Plaintiff’s initial report, hot water service had not been restored. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant about the continuing lack of hot water.

17. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the replacement part was allegedly “backordered,” but provided no alternative means for Plaintiff to have hot water in the Apartment and did not offer any rent abatement, relocation assistance, or other reasonable accommodation.

18. Approximately two weeks after the loss of hot water, Plaintiff followed up again with Defendant. Defendant again stated that the part remained “backordered” and that he was “working on it.”

19. As of the date of this Complaint, nearly one month has elapsed since Plaintiff first lost hot water, and Defendant still has not restored hot water service to the Apartment.

20. For this entire period, Plaintiff has been forced to live in the Apartment without hot water, which has substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of her home and created unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.

21. In order to bathe and maintain basic hygiene, Plaintiff has been compelled to obtain access to hot water outside the Apartment.

22. Plaintiff has been forced to use a gym for showers, paying approximately $30 per month in gym fees that she did not previously have to incur, plus additional costs for gas and travel.

23. Plaintiff has also been compelled to take her baby to her mother’s home for baths, because it is unsafe and unreasonable to bathe an infant in cold water and impractical to bathe an infant in water heated solely on a stove.

24. In order to wash dishes and maintain minimal cleanliness in the Apartment, Plaintiff has had to boil water on the stove repeatedly, which is time-consuming, burdensome, and increases Plaintiff’s gas and/or electric utility use.

25. Defendant has acknowledged the lack of hot water, but despite having notice for approximately three weeks, he has failed to take timely and effective action to restore this essential service, such as arranging for a replacement heater, hiring an alternative contractor, or providing a temporary solution.

26. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water within a reasonable period of time, after actual notice of the loss of this essential service, has resulted in substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

27. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages as a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, including but not limited to: (a) the loss of the use and enjoyment of a habitable dwelling; (b) out-of-pocket costs for gym membership and increased travel; (c) increased utility and household costs; (d) hardship and inconvenience associated with traveling to another residence to bathe her baby; and (e) stress, discomfort, and disruption of daily life resulting from the lack of hot water.

28. Based on these harms and the loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment, Plaintiff reasonably estimates her actual damages at no less than approximately $450.00, exclusive of statutory multiples, interest, and costs.

29. Plaintiff brings this action solely for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and does not assert any other causes of action in this Complaint.

COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

30. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

32. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects a tenant from substantial interference by the landlord with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982).

33. A landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment where his acts or omissions, after notice, substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including by allowing serious Sanitary Code violations to persist. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–19 (1977); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285–86 (1994).

34. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that the landlord’s failure to correct violations of the State Sanitary Code after notice may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–77 (1994); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979).

35. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.190, requires that the landlord provide and maintain a heating facility or system that supplies hot water at the required temperature levels. The prolonged lack of hot water in a residence is a serious Sanitary Code violation and a condition affecting health and safety. See also 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

36. Under Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and its progeny, essential services such as hot water are part of the implied warranty of habitability, and the absence of such services constitutes a material defect in the premises.

37. Defendant had actual notice of the complete loss of hot water in Plaintiff’s Apartment from the same day the problem began, approximately three weeks prior to the date of this Complaint.

38. Despite having such notice, Defendant failed to restore hot water within a reasonable time, failed to provide an alternative source of hot water, and failed to offer rent abatement or relocation, thereby allowing the Sanitary Code violation and uninhabitable condition to persist.

39. Defendant’s failure to take timely and effective action to correct this serious and ongoing defect constitutes at least “indirect” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 285–86 (failure to remedy known conditions can constitute interference); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. at 776–77.

40. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been substantial, not trivial or technical, in that Plaintiff has been deprived of hot water for approximately three weeks, has been unable to bathe normally in her home, has had to travel to a gym and to her mother’s house for bathing, and has had to boil water for everyday tasks.

41. The interference has affected the health, safety, and basic living conditions of Plaintiff and her child, and has rendered the Apartment significantly less habitable and less usable than a reasonable tenant would expect for a residential dwelling in Massachusetts. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. at 199–201 (substantial interference standard); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 101–04.

42. A landlord’s inability to obtain parts or reliance on contractors does not excuse the failure to provide essential services such as hot water where alternative measures or timely repairs could reasonably be made. See generally Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 717–19 (landlord liable where his conduct created or allowed conditions interfering with tenants’ enjoyment even without specific intent to harm); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. at 850–52 (liability for failure to correct conditions).

43. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated by conditions that the landlord permits to exist, as well as by affirmative acts. Defendant’s ongoing omission in failing to restore hot water after notice falls within the scope of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 285–86.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to: loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment; out-of-pocket expenses for gym membership and transportation; increased utility and household expenses; and inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, and disruption to daily life, including the burden of arranging baths for her baby outside the home.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 111–12 (discussing statutory remedies); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–89 (1994) (quiet enjoyment remedies are mandatory upon a finding of violation).

46. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00. Three months’ rent is $3,600.00. Plaintiff’s actual damages, while estimated at no less than approximately $450.00, are less than three months’ rent.

47. Accordingly, upon a finding that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff is entitled by statute to recover at least three months’ rent, or $3,600.00, plus costs and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper, regardless of whether Plaintiff is able to prove a higher amount of actual damages. G.L. c. 186, § 14.

48. Although G.L. c. 186, § 14 authorizes an award of reasonable attorney’s fees to a prevailing tenant, Plaintiff is filing this Complaint pro se because she cannot presently afford counsel and has been unable to obtain legal aid representation in a timely manner. Plaintiff nevertheless seeks all statutory remedies available to her, including attorney’s fees to the extent she later retains counsel.

49. Plaintiff has fully performed all of her material obligations under the tenancy, except to the extent her obligations have been excused or diminished by Defendant’s breach and the uninhabitable conditions in the Apartment, as recognized under Massachusetts law. See Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Torres, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Mark Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount equal to the greater of (i) Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, reasonably estimated at not less than $450.00, or (ii) three (3) months’ rent, i.e., $3,600.00;

C. An award of costs of this action, including filing fees and service of process;

D. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff retains counsel and/or as otherwise permitted by law;

E. Such further and other relief, at law or in equity, as this Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to injunctive or equitable relief ordering Defendant to promptly restore and maintain adequate hot water service in compliance with the State Sanitary Code.

JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right under the laws and Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,
