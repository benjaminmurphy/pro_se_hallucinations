Co., a commercial insurance coverage and estoppel case. It does not concern residential tenancies, covenants of quiet enjoyment, or standards for when landlords breach that covenant, and thus cannot support the stated proposition about landlord\u2011tenant law.

Lowery does interpret \u00a7 14 to cover a serious habitability-related interference (failure to provide heat), but it does so without discussing landlord notice, opportunity to cure, or using any \u2018broad\u2019 interpretive language about notice-based duties. The case is good authority that lack of heat breaching quiet enjoyment triggers \u00a7 14 liability regardless of financial inability, but it does not specifically support the notice-and-opportunity-to-cure aspect of the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cA landlord\u2019s failure to provide heat during the heating season\u2026 seriously \u2018impair[s] the character and value of the leased premises\u2019\u2026 and constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment\u2026 It is not necessary to recovery that the landlord intended to violate the covenant. Rather \u2018the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling.\u2019\u2026 Thus, as suggested by the language of the statute itself\u2026, liability will be imposed \u2018whenever the \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of [the] landlord\u2019s action [is] interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights.\u2019\u201d"
