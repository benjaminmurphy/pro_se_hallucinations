COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND (NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Thomas Baker (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful user of Chestnut Hill Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Thomas Baker is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, possessed, and/or controlled a large dog (the “Dog”) that he regularly brought to Chestnut Hill Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising out of Defendant’s negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The Newton Division of the District Court Department has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and related provisions because the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court.

5. Venue is proper in this Court because the incident giving rise to this action occurred at Chestnut Hill Park in Newton, Massachusetts, which lies within the territorial jurisdiction of the Newton Division of the District Court Department. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately mid‑afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a paved or maintained path in Chestnut Hill Park, in Newton, Massachusetts (the “Park”).

7. The Park is open to the public for recreational use, including jogging and walking, and is frequented by runners, walkers, and dog‑owners.

8. The City of Newton posts signage in the Park requiring that dogs be kept on a leash at all times or in designated areas, consistent with Newton’s municipal leash laws and ordinances. See, e.g., G.L. c. 140, §§ 136A–174F (authorizing municipal regulation of dogs).

9. At the time of the incident, prominent signs were posted in the Park stating that all dogs must be on leashes.

10. On multiple prior occasions before September 15, 2023, Plaintiff had observed Defendant at the Park allowing his large dog to run off‑leash, notwithstanding the posted leash requirements.

11. On September 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was jogging on the Park path, Defendant was present in the Park with his large dog.

12. At that time, Defendant had the dog’s leash draped or held over his shoulder, but the leash was not attached to the dog’s collar or harness.

13. Defendant was standing approximately thirty (30) feet away from Plaintiff, engaged in conversation with friends or acquaintances, and was not maintaining physical control over the dog.

14. Defendant knew or should have known that the Park required dogs to be on leash, and that the dog was at that moment off leash and free to run at will.

15. Without warning, as Plaintiff was jogging by on the path, Defendant’s dog suddenly and rapidly charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and in an aggressive and threatening manner.

16. The dog’s sudden charge and loud barking occurred in close proximity to Plaintiff and on or near the path where Plaintiff was running.

17. As the dog charged at Plaintiff, there was no indication that it would stop; from Plaintiff’s perspective, the dog appeared likely to strike, jump on, or bite her.

18. Defendant did not have the dog under physical control and did not promptly recall or restrain the dog before it charged at Plaintiff.

19. Given the dog’s size, speed, and aggressive barking, and Defendant’s lack of control, Plaintiff reasonably believed that she was in immediate danger of being attacked, bitten, or knocked down by the dog.

20. In a split‑second effort to avoid the oncoming dog and protect herself from what she reasonably perceived as an imminent physical attack, Plaintiff swerved sharply off the path away from the dog’s line of approach.

21. As Plaintiff swerved off the path, she encountered uneven terrain, including exposed tree roots and a small embankment adjacent to the path.

22. Plaintiff’s sudden evasive maneuver, directly prompted by the dog’s charge and Defendant’s failure to restrain it, caused her to trip over a tree root.

23. As a result of tripping over the root, Plaintiff fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path and landed forcefully on her arm and wrist.

24. Plaintiff immediately experienced substantial pain in her wrist and arm as a result of the fall.

25. The dog did not actually bite or physically contact Plaintiff, but its sudden, aggressive charge and barking, combined with Defendant’s failure to control it, directly caused Plaintiff’s evasive movement and fall.

26. After Plaintiff fell, the dog stopped advancing, and only then did Defendant call the dog back to him.

27. Several other joggers and Park users witnessed the incident, including the dog running off‑leash, charging toward Plaintiff, barking aggressively, and Plaintiff swerving and falling.

28. These witnesses observed that Defendant had the leash in his possession but had chosen not to attach it to the dog, despite the posted leash rules.

29. Emergency medical attention was necessary. Plaintiff either sought or was transported to a hospital emergency room promptly after the incident.

30. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was evaluated and diagnosed with a broken or fractured wrist, consistent with injuries from a fall down an embankment.

31. Plaintiff was required to wear a brace or comparable immobilizing device for several weeks and to undergo follow‑up medical visits.

32. Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,000 in medical expenses related to emergency treatment, imaging, follow‑up visits, and related care.

33. Plaintiff also missed work as a direct result of her injuries, losing approximately $1,200 in wages.

34. In addition, Plaintiff was unable to participate in a piano recital for which she had been practicing, and her wrist injury interfered with her ability to perform piano and other daily activities.

35. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional distress as a result of the incident and injuries.

36. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in controlling his dog in a public park, to comply with applicable leash laws and posted rules, and to avoid foreseeable risks of harm to other lawful users of the Park, including Plaintiff.

37. Defendant breached this duty by, among other things:

   a. Allowing his large dog to run off‑leash in violation of posted rules and municipal law;  
   b. Failing to maintain physical or effective control over the dog in a public, shared space;  
   c. Failing to prevent the dog from charging and barking aggressively at Plaintiff as she jogged on the path; and  
   d. Failing to timely recall or restrain the dog to prevent it from causing a foreseeable risk of injury to Plaintiff.

38. It was reasonably foreseeable that an off‑leash, charging, loudly barking dog could cause a reasonable person using due care, such as Plaintiff, to take evasive action to avoid a perceived attack, potentially leading to a fall and injury.

39. Defendant’s acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries and damages.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, incurred medical expenses, suffered lost wages, endured pain and suffering, and experienced loss of enjoyment of life and other damages.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**NEGLIGENCE (COMMON‑LAW)**

41. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

42. Under Massachusetts common law, every person owes a duty to exercise the care of a reasonably prudent person under like circumstances to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–48 (2006) (general duty of reasonable care; duty to protect foreseeable plaintiffs from harm caused by third parties or instrumentalities under one’s control); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (duty of reasonable care in context of dog‑related injuries).

43. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful user of the Park, a duty of reasonable care to control his dog so as not to create an unreasonable risk of physical harm to others lawfully present in the Park.

44. Defendant also had a duty to comply with applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations governing dog control and leashing, including but not limited to G.L. c. 140, §§ 136A–174F, and the City of Newton’s leash laws, as reflected in the posted signs in the Park.

45. Violation of such statutes and ordinances is evidence of negligence and may constitute a breach of the duty of reasonable care. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 358–59 (1990) (statutory violations as evidence of negligence); *McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300, 303–04 (1999).

**Breach**

46. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by knowingly allowing his large dog to roam off‑leash in a public park despite clearly posted leash requirements, and by failing to maintain physical control of the dog.

47. Defendant further breached his duty by failing to prevent or promptly stop the dog from charging and barking aggressively toward Plaintiff as she jogged on the path.

48. Defendant’s decision to keep the leash over his shoulder rather than attached to the dog, and to engage in conversation instead of actively supervising and controlling the dog, fell below the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances.

49. Under Massachusetts law, an owner or person in control of a dog must exercise reasonable care to prevent the dog from causing foreseeable harm, including harm resulting from the dog’s menacing or frightening behavior, even if the dog does not actually bite the injured person. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. at 696–97; *Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co.*, 407 Mass. 185, 188–89 (1990) (foreseeable risk of physical harm creates duty of reasonable care).

50. Defendant knew or should have known that his large dog, when allowed to run free and bark aggressively in close proximity to pedestrians and joggers, could reasonably frighten them and cause evasive actions, trips, and falls.

51. Defendant’s failure to leash, restrain, and control the dog, in the face of foreseeable risk to persons such as Plaintiff, constitutes negligence.

**Causation**

52. To establish negligence under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff must show that Defendant’s breach of duty was a cause in fact and a proximate cause of her injuries. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 147–48; *Abrams v. Reynolds Metals Co.*, 340 Mass. 704, 706–07 (1960).

53. But for Defendant’s failure to leash and control his dog, the dog would not have charged at Plaintiff, barking aggressively, and Plaintiff would not have been forced to make a sudden evasive maneuver off the path.

54. Plaintiff’s decision to swerve away from the charging dog was an immediate, reasonable reaction to an apparent and imminent danger of attack, and was a foreseeable response to Defendant’s negligent failure to control his dog. See *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978) (foreseeability of plaintiff’s reaction to defendant’s negligence); *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–95 (1987).

55. The sequence of events—from Defendant’s failure to leash the dog, to the dog’s charge and barking, to Plaintiff’s evasive maneuver, to her trip over the tree root and fall—is a natural and continuous chain of causation, with no superseding or intervening cause breaking the causal link.

56. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable for all harm that is a foreseeable consequence of his negligent act, even when the precise manner of injury involves an intervening condition such as uneven terrain, provided such occurrence is within the scope of foreseeable risk. See *Jesionek*, 376 Mass. at 105–06; *Solimene*, 399 Mass. at 794–95.

57. The presence of natural features such as tree roots and embankments adjacent to a park path is a common, foreseeable condition, and it was reasonably foreseeable that a frightened pedestrian or jogger might trip on such features when reacting to an off‑leash dog’s sudden charge.

58. Defendant’s negligence was both a cause in fact and a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries.

**Damages**

59. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist and associated physical injuries, causing her pain, suffering, and loss of mobility.

60. Plaintiff has incurred, and is reasonably expected to incur, medical expenses for emergency room treatment, diagnostic imaging, brace or immobilization, follow‑up visits, and related care, in an amount currently estimated at approximately $5,000.

61. Plaintiff has lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200 due to missed work caused by her injuries.

62. Plaintiff has also suffered loss of enjoyment of life and impairment of her ability to engage in activities she previously enjoyed, including preparing for and performing in a piano recital, and the ongoing inability or difficulty in engaging in similar recreational and artistic activities.

63. Plaintiff has endured and continues to endure physical pain, emotional distress, anxiety, and inconvenience as a result of the incident and her injuries.

64. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for past and future medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See *Dobos v. Driscoll*, 404 Mass. 634, 640–41 (1989); *Haddad v. Gonzales*, 410 Mass. 855, 871–72 (1991).

65. To the extent Defendant contends that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent in reacting to the charging dog, such contention is without merit; however, Plaintiff pleads that, even if comparative negligence were found, it would be less than 51%, and Plaintiff’s damages would remain recoverable subject to reduction pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85. See *Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 62–63 (1988).

66. Plaintiff has complied, or will comply, with the procedural requirements of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to this action, including service of process.

67. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable, pursuant to Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.
