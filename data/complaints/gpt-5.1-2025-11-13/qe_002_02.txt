JORDAN LEE,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                Civil Action No. ___________

MARTHA JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Lee (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows against Defendant Martha Johnson (“Defendant”):


## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Lee is an individual residing at 345 Walnut Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Defendant Martha Johnson is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner, lessor, and/or person entitled to receive rent for the residential premises located at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant acted as Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and other applicable Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.


## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action arising under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, including G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Boston Municipal Court.

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 1, 19 and related provisions, the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, has jurisdiction over this action because the Premises are located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and the claims arose there.

7. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, because the rental property that is the subject of this action is located at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.


## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff began renting a residential basement apartment from Defendant at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Apartment” or the “Premises”).

9. The tenancy is, and at all relevant times has been, a residential tenancy governed by G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239.

10. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent of $1,200.00 to Defendant to occupy the Apartment.

11. Plaintiff’s tenancy has been continuous from on or about March 1, 2022, through the present date.

12. As part of the tenancy, Plaintiff is entitled to the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

13. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for maintaining the structure and exterior of the Premises, including the basement walls and any water intrusion issues, in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code (see G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.).

14. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying that month’s rent due to unanticipated medical bills.

15. Plaintiff subsequently paid the full October rent along with any late fee assessed, and Plaintiff’s rent was brought current.

16. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff observed water seeping through the basement wall of the Apartment whenever it rained heavily.

17. The water intrusion occurred repeatedly during periods of rain and caused visible dampness and wetness along at least one exterior or foundation wall of the basement.

18. On or about early November 2025, shortly after noticing the water seepage, Plaintiff texted Defendant and notified her of the water problem, including that water was seeping through the wall and into the living area.

19. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but Defendant did not promptly take reasonable steps to investigate or remedy the condition.

20. Over the following weeks in November 2025, the water intrusion persisted whenever there was heavy rain.

21. During this time, Defendant failed to conduct adequate repairs or to hire appropriate professionals to diagnose and fix the water intrusion.

22. The recurring water seepage damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including, but not limited to, a rug and a bookshelf located against the affected wall.

23. The approximate value of the damaged personal property is at least $400.00.

24. Because of the dampness and moisture in the Apartment, Plaintiff has been forced to run a dehumidifier nearly constantly to mitigate mold, odors, and further damage.

25. Running the dehumidifier continuously has increased Plaintiff’s electric bill and utility costs.

26. The presence of water intrusion and excessive moisture in a basement apartment is a condition that can adversely affect the health and safety of the occupant and can constitute a violation of the State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.500 and related provisions requiring that dwellings be maintained free of chronic dampness and water penetration.

27. After several weeks passed without an effective repair by Defendant, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston’s inspectional or code enforcement authorities (the “City”) to report the water intrusion and other conditions in the Apartment.

28. City inspectors visited the Premises in or about late November 2025.

29. During that inspection, the City identified the water intrusion in the basement and, upon information and belief, identified additional code-related issues at the Premises.

30. Plaintiff cooperated with the City inspection and allowed inspectors access to the Apartment.

31. Defendant was aware, or should have been aware, that City inspectors had been called and had inspected the Premises.

32. Despite being placed on notice by Plaintiff’s text, by the ongoing water intrusion, and by the City inspection, Defendant failed and continues to fail to correct the water intrusion and related dampness in the Apartment.

33. As of December 1, 2025, the water intrusion problem has not been fully repaired, and Plaintiff continues to experience leaks and/or seepage during heavy rain, ongoing dampness, and the need to run a dehumidifier.

34. Instead of addressing the conditions, Defendant began referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

35. Defendant has told Plaintiff that she does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in or about March 2026 (or March 2025 if the lease term runs to that date, depending on renewal history) and that Plaintiff must vacate at the end of the lease term.

36. Defendant has stated that the reason she will not renew the lease is Plaintiff’s late payment of rent in October, despite the fact that the rent was paid with the late fee and was brought current.

37. The timing of Defendant’s decision not to renew, coming shortly after (a) Plaintiff’s complaints about water intrusion and (b) the City inspection, is suspicious and suggests animus toward Plaintiff for asserting his rights and calling the City.

38. Defendant’s inaction in repairing the water intrusion, her disparaging characterization of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant,” and her expressed intent not to renew Plaintiff’s lease have combined to create substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to peacefully and securely enjoy the Premises.

39. The persistent water intrusion has rendered parts of the Apartment damp, uncomfortable, and unhealthy, has damaged Plaintiff’s property, and has imposed additional expense and stress on Plaintiff.

40. Plaintiff has experienced anxiety, emotional distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of his home as a result of the unresolved water intrusion and Defendant’s hostile response.

41. The conditions described above, and Defendant’s failure to timely and adequately remedy them after notice, constitute an interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, as interpreted by Massachusetts courts.

42. Plaintiff has complied with all material terms of his tenancy, including paying rent (with late fee for October 2025) and allowing reasonable access, and has not caused the water intrusion.

43. Plaintiff has been forced to bring this action to seek damages and other lawful relief for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.


## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)

44. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 43 as if fully set forth herein.

45. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes a covenant that the tenant shall have the quiet enjoyment of the premises free from any acts or omissions of the landlord or persons acting under the landlord’s control which substantially interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.

46. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three month’s rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

47. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s failure to correct serious conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code, after notice, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.,  
   a. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (persistent flooding, water leakage, and failure to repair after notice constituted a breach of quiet enjoyment and warranted substantial damages);  
   b. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (serious conditions and landlord’s inaction may amount to interference with quiet enjoyment);  
   c. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for interference with quiet enjoyment caused by activities within landlord’s control);  
   d. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (conditions violating sanitary code and landlord’s failure to act can support quiet enjoyment claim);  
   e. *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (landlord’s omissions that allow conditions to persist may constitute substantial interference).

48. Massachusetts courts have recognized that water intrusion, chronic dampness, and related unsanitary conditions can constitute violations of the State Sanitary Code and give rise to damages and rent abatements. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (sanitary code violations justify rent abatement and other tenant remedies).

49. The State Sanitary Code requires that dwelling units be free from chronic dampness and water penetration and that they be maintained in a condition fit for human habitation. See G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

50. Defendant, as landlord, had a non-delegable duty to maintain the Premises, including the basement walls and exterior structure, so as to prevent chronic water intrusion and unsanitary conditions.

51. Plaintiff notified Defendant in or about early November 2025 that water was seeping through the basement wall and causing dampness and damage in the Apartment.

52. The City’s inspection in or about late November 2025 further put Defendant on notice of the water intrusion and related code violations.

53. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to make timely and effective repairs to stop the recurring water intrusion and to remediate the resulting dampness and damage.

54. Defendant’s omissions allowed the water intrusion and unsanitary conditions to persist over a period of weeks and/or months.

55. As a result of Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff’s personal property was damaged, Plaintiff incurred additional utility costs, and Plaintiff’s living environment became damp and uncomfortable.

56. The repeated water intrusion and dampness materially and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as a habitable home.

57. Under *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), a landlord’s persistent failure to correct flooding and water damage after notice is a classic example of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, entitling the tenant to damages including emotional distress.

58. Defendant’s statements characterizing Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and her stated intent not to renew the lease shortly after Plaintiff contacted the City, while not themselves constituting a separate statutory claim here, further demonstrate Defendant’s disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and have contributed to Plaintiff’s loss of secure and peaceful enjoyment of the Premises.

59. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when the landlord’s actions or inactions substantially interfere with the tenant’s ability to use the premises as a dwelling, regardless of the landlord’s subjective intent. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

60. Defendant’s failure to remediate the water intrusion and dampness, after repeated notice, constitutes such a substantial interference.

61. Plaintiff’s late payment of October 2025 rent, which was subsequently paid in full with the late fee, does not excuse Defendant’s ongoing statutory obligations to maintain the Premises and to avoid interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See generally *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing tenant’s rights based on conditions independent of rent status and establishing modern landlord-tenant principles).

62. Plaintiff has suffered “actual and consequential damages” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to:  
   a. Damage to personal property estimated at approximately $400.00;  
   b. Increased electric costs associated with running a dehumidifier;  
   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Apartment;  
   d. Discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional distress arising from living in a repeatedly damp and leaking basement apartment and from the fear of ongoing deterioration and retaliation.

63. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either his actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, even if he is self-represented. See *Meikle v. Nurse*, 474 Mass. 207 (2016) (interpreting remedial landlord-tenant provisions broadly to protect tenants); *Armstrong v. Rohm & Haas Co.*, 349 F. Supp. 2d 71 (D. Mass. 2004) (discussing fee-shifting statutes’ remedial purposes).

64. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00; three months’ rent therefore equals $3,600.00.

65. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, while still being calculated, appear to be less than three months’ rent, and therefore three months’ rent is the minimum statutory damage amount recoverable under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

66. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to statutory damages of at least $3,600.00, plus costs of this action, and reasonable attorney’s fees should counsel enter an appearance, as mandated by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and as applied in *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982), and related cases.


## V. DAMAGES

67. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:

   a. **Property Damage:** Approximately $400.00 in damage to a rug, a bookshelf, and any other personal property affected by water intrusion.

   b. **Increased Utility Costs:** Additional electric charges from running a dehumidifier on a near-constant basis to mitigate the dampness and prevent further damage.

   c. **Loss of Use and Enjoyment:** Deprivation of the full use of the Apartment, increased discomfort, and interference with Plaintiff’s ability to live normally, relax, and feel secure at home.

   d. **Emotional Distress and Inconvenience:** Anxiety, stress, and emotional upset from the ongoing water intrusion, fear of mold or structural issues, concern about loss of housing, and Defendant’s characterization of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

68. Plaintiff is entitled to recover, at minimum, the greater of:  
   (1) actual and consequential damages; or  
   (2) three months’ rent ($3,600.00), under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

69. Plaintiff also seeks all costs of this action and, if represented by counsel, reasonable attorney’s fees, as expressly authorized by G.L. c. 186, § 14.


## VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Lee respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Martha Johnson and award the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by failing to remedy the water intrusion and related conditions after notice, thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises;

B. Statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than three (3) months’ rent, i.e., at least Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600.00), or Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater;

C. Compensation for Plaintiff’s property damage (estimated at approximately $400.00), increased utility costs, loss of use and enjoyment, inconvenience, and emotional distress, to the extent such damages are not already encompassed within the statutory minimum;

D. An order requiring Defendant to promptly and adequately repair and remediate the water intrusion and related dampness conditions in the Apartment, and to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, and 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.;

E. Court costs and, if Plaintiff becomes represented by counsel, reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;

F. Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.
