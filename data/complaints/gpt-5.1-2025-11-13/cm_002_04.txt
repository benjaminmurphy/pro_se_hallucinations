  Plaintiff,  

v.  

JAMES CARTER,  
  Defendant.

Docket No. __________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Maria Torres (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, James Carter (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Maria Torres, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the mother and primary physical custodian of the minor child, Sophia Carter (hereinafter “Sophia” or “the child”), age 9.

2. The Defendant, James Carter, upon information and belief, presently resides in or intends imminently to reside in the State of New Hampshire, and is the father of Sophia.

3. This Complaint concerns custody, parenting time, and related matters regarding the minor child, over whom this Court has continuing jurisdiction.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as it is the court that entered the existing custody and parenting-time order and retains continuing jurisdiction to modify that order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the child’s best interests.

5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, Cambridge Division, because the prior custody and parenting-time judgment or order was entered in this Court and the child has resided within Middlesex County.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT OR ORDER

6. On or about May 15, 2021, this Court entered a judgment and/or order (the “Existing Order”) concerning legal custody and parenting time for the parties’ minor child, Sophia.

7. Under the Existing Order, the Mother was granted primary physical custody of Sophia, with the Father having parenting time consisting of:
   a. an overnight visit each Wednesday; and  
   b. parenting time every other weekend, with overnights, as set forth in the Existing Order.

8. The Existing Order and parenting schedule were structured and approved on the predicate assumption that both parents resided in or near the Cambridge area and that Sophia attended a local school in close proximity to each parent’s residence, thereby minimizing commuting time and disruption to her school schedule and extracurricular activities.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Subsequent to the entry of the Existing Order, Father now seeks to relocate his residence to the State of New Hampshire for a new job opportunity, while maintaining the same midweek overnight and alternating weekend schedule.

10. Father’s intended or actual relocation to New Hampshire (approximately a ninety-minute drive each way in typical traffic from the child’s school and Mother’s residence) constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances from those that existed at the time the Existing Order was entered.

11. The current schedule, if maintained without modification, would require Sophia to:
   a. travel approximately ninety (90) minutes each way between Mother’s home/school and Father’s new residence in New Hampshire for the Wednesday overnight;  
   b. wake up significantly earlier than her peers on Thursday mornings to accommodate the lengthy commute back to school; and  
   c. regularly miss or be unable to participate fully in after-school activities and extracurriculars on midweek days associated with Father’s parenting time.

12. Sophia is 9 years old and in elementary school; her educational schedule, after-school activities, homework, routines, and need for consistent sleep and rest are central to her well-being and development.

13. Since learning about the anticipated long drives and disruption to her activities, Sophia has become increasingly anxious and distressed about the midweek overnights, including:
   a. expressing worry about being late or exhausted at school;  
   b. expressing anxiety about the long car rides, particularly in heavy traffic and/or poor weather; and  
   c. expressing concern about missing her regular after-school activities, social time with peers, and established routines.

14. The expanded distance between the parents’ residences—combined with the child’s school attendance and developmental needs—creates new logistical and emotional burdens that did not exist when the Existing Order was issued.

15. The Father’s contemplated relocation and its impact on the child’s midweek routine and commute are facts that were neither known to nor reasonably contemplated by the Court when it issued the Existing Order on May 15, 2021.

16. The need to re-evaluate parenting time where a parent moves a substantial distance from the child’s primary residence and school is widely recognized as a material change in circumstances under Massachusetts law, particularly where the existing schedule becomes impracticable or detrimental to the child’s best interests. See, e.g., *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

17. As a direct result of Father’s relocation and the increased travel demands, the Existing Order is no longer workable, practical, nor consistent with Sophia’s best interests, especially with respect to the Wednesday overnight parenting time.

### V. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

18. A Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting-time order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schwartz v. Schwartz*, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 322, 325–26 (2011); *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 151–52 (2015).

19. In determining the best interests of a child in custody and parenting-time disputes, the Court’s “paramount concern” is the child’s welfare and happiness. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003).

20. The Court must consider, among other factors, the child’s age, developmental needs, school and educational stability, the child’s emotional well-being, the child’s relationship with each parent, and the practical impact of any proposed parenting schedule. *See* G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711–12 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006).

21. Substantial changes in the parties’ residences and the distance between the parents’ homes and the child’s school can constitute a material change warranting modification, particularly where the existing schedule imposes undue burdens on the child’s commuting time, school attendance, and extra-curricular participation. *See* *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015); *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

22. Massachusetts courts recognize that long commutes which interfere with a child’s sleep, schooling, or stability may be contrary to the child’s best interests and may justify revising parenting time to reduce midweek travel. *See* *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 153–55; *Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 681–83.

23. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and related case law, the Court has broad equitable powers to adjust parenting time and allocation of custodial rights to protect the child’s best interests and to address changes in circumstances. *See* *Care & Protection of Georgette*, 439 Mass. 28, 38 (2003); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 493–94 (2012).

24. The Court may also consider the child’s anxiety, stress, and emotional reaction to a parenting schedule as part of the best-interest analysis, especially when tied to objectively burdensome logistics. *See* *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–97; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44; *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 153–55.

25. Under these statutes and cases—G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the line of cases including *Yannas*, *Mason*, *Murray*, *Rosenwasser*, *Schwartz*, *Custody of Vaughn*, and *Custody of Kali*—the Father’s relocation and the resulting hardships on the existing midweek overnight schedule constitute the sort of material change that authorizes and warrants judicial modification of parenting time.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

26. Sophia’s best interests are served by a parenting-time arrangement that:
   a. preserves her stability and routine in school;  
   b. minimizes excessively long commutes, particularly on school nights;  
   c. supports adequate sleep, homework time, and participation in extracurricular activities; and  
   d. reduces unnecessary anxiety and stress tied to transportation and schedule disruptions.

27. Requiring Sophia to commute approximately three (3) hours round-trip on a school night, in addition to her school day and homework responsibilities, is inconsistent with sound educational and developmental practices and is detrimental to her physical and emotional well-being.

28. The long midweek commute would increase the risk that Sophia will:
   a. be overtired and less able to concentrate in school;  
   b. fall behind academically due to limited homework time;  
   c. miss or be unable to regularly participate in after-school activities that are important for her social, emotional, and physical development; and  
   d. experience heightened anxiety, stress, and possible resentment associated with parenting time.

29. While meaningful contact with both parents is important and Mother fully supports an ongoing relationship between Father and Sophia, such contact must be structured in a manner that is realistically compatible with the geographic distance between the parties and with the child’s age, schooling, and developmental needs. *See* *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 711–12; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–84.

30. The Father’s parenting time can and should be restructured to emphasize weekends and school vacations rather than a midweek overnight that is now impractical and harmful when considered in light of the long-distance relocation.

31. A modification that removes the midweek overnight but maintains and, where feasible, slightly enhances weekend and/or school vacation time with Father will preserve a strong parent–child relationship while better protecting Sophia’s day-to-day welfare, educational stability, and emotional health.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

32. The Mother does not seek to alter the parties’ legal custody arrangement (to the extent legal custody has already been determined) but seeks modification solely of the parenting-time schedule to accommodate Father’s relocation and to protect Sophia’s best interests.

33. Mother requests that the Court find that Father’s move to New Hampshire and the consequential impact on the midweek overnight visitation schedule constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order of May 15, 2021.

34. Mother further requests that the Court determine that it is in Sophia’s best interests that the Existing Order be modified so as to eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight and adjust Father’s parenting time to a more workable schedule in light of the distance between the parties.

35. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court enter a Modified Order providing substantially as follows:

   a. Primary Physical Custody  
      Mother shall continue to have primary physical custody of Sophia, with Sophia’s primary residence remaining with Mother.

   b. Midweek Parenting Time  
      i. The existing Wednesday overnight with Father shall be eliminated in light of Father’s relocation and the burden of lengthy school-night commuting on the child.  
      ii. In the Court’s discretion, Father may have an in-person midweek visit that does not involve an overnight and does not unreasonably interfere with Sophia’s school schedule or after-school activities (for example, a Wednesday afternoon/early evening dinner visit in or near the child’s school or Mother’s town), provided that transportation arrangements do not require the child to travel excessive distances on a school night.

   c. Weekend Parenting Time  
      i. Father shall continue to have parenting time on alternating weekends.  
      ii. In recognition of the removal of the midweek overnight, the Court may, if consistent with Sophia’s best interests, modestly extend Father’s alternating weekend visits (for example, from Friday after school or early evening until Sunday evening) to facilitate meaningful and consolidated parenting time that does not disrupt school nights.

   d. Holidays, School Vacations, and Summer  
      i. The parties shall share major holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time in a manner that permits Father to have meaningful time with Sophia when school is not in session, thereby avoiding excessive midweek commuting during the school year.  
      ii. The details of the holiday, vacation, and summer schedule may continue as provided in the Existing Order unless otherwise modified by the Court, or may be clarified in the Modified Order to account for the new distance between the parties’ residences.

   e. Transportation  
      The parties shall share responsibility for transportation in a fair and reasonable manner in light of Father’s relocation, with the understanding that transportation arrangements must minimize disruption to Sophia’s school schedule, sleep, and activities.

36. Mother’s requested modification is tailored to address the specific material change in circumstances (Father’s relocation and the resulting midweek commuting burden) while preserving and supporting Sophia’s ongoing relationship with Father.

37. The requested modification is consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and Massachusetts case law (*Yannas*, *Mason*, *Murray*, *Rosenwasser*, *Schwartz*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Custody of Kali*, *Hunter v. Rose*, and related authorities) and is in the best interests of the minor child.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Maria Torres, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Order of May 15, 2021, including but not limited to the Defendant’s relocation or intended relocation to New Hampshire and the resulting impact on the existing midweek overnight parenting schedule;

B. Find that modification of the Existing Order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Sophia;

C. Enter a Modified Order:
   1. Confirming that Mother shall continue to have primary physical custody of Sophia;  
   2. Eliminating the Wednesday midweek overnight with Father;  
   3. Adjusting Father’s parenting time to focus on alternating weekends and, as appropriate, additional non-school-day time (such as holidays, school vacations, and summer), and permitting reasonable non-overnight midweek contact that does not impose excessive commuting burdens on the child;  
   4. Allocating transportation responsibilities between the parties in a fair and reasonable manner that protects Sophia’s school schedule, sleep, and extracurricular activities;

D. Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,  
MARIA TORRES
