COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
MIDDLESEX DIVISION  

------------------------------------------------------  
LINDSAY CARTER,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  

JASON REYNOLDS,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

Docket No. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, LINDSAY CARTER (“Lindsay” or “Plaintiff”), and complains of the Defendant, JASON REYNOLDS (“Jason” or “Defendant”), and states as follows:

                                   I.   PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emily Carter (DOB: __________, age 10).

2. The Defendant, Jason Reynolds, is an individual believed to reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Emily Carter.

3. The minor child who is the subject of this Complaint is:

   a. Emily Carter, age 10 (“Emily”).

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, because this Court issued the existing custody judgment and the child resides within the Commonwealth.

                       II.   PRIOR JUDGMENT AND ORDERS

5. On or about April 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Agreement regarding custody and parenting time (the “Judgment”).

6. Under the April 15, 2022 Judgment:

   a. The parties share joint legal custody of Emily.

   b. The Plaintiff, Lindsay, is the primary residential parent.

   c. The Defendant, Jason, has substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnight, such that Emily is with Jason on Sunday nights and returns to school on Mondays from Jason’s care.

   d. The parties are required to cooperate regarding Emily’s school matters, including attendance, and to keep one another informed about significant educational issues.

7. At the time the April 15, 2022 Judgment was entered, Emily was doing well in school, her attendance was regular, and no significant concerns about truancy, chronic absenteeism, or educational neglect had been identified.

8. The current Judgment does not grant either party tie‑breaking authority over school attendance decisions, nor does it tailor parenting time to address school attendance or academic needs.

               III.   MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the April 15, 2022 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of Emily, particularly relating to her school attendance, academic performance, and educational stability.

10. Over the past year, during Jason’s weekends with Emily, the Defendant has repeatedly and routinely kept Emily out of school on Mondays following his parenting time, asserting that Emily “needs a mental health day.”

11. The Defendant’s choice to keep Emily home on Mondays has not been supported by any medical, psychological, or other professional recommendation, and there are no doctor’s notes or other documentation excusing these absences as medically necessary.

12. As a result of the recurring Monday absences from school while in Jason’s care, the school has issued truancy and/or chronic absenteeism warnings regarding Emily’s attendance.

13. Emily’s grades and test scores have dropped in the past year, coinciding with the increase in unexcused or inadequately justified absences, especially on Mondays following weekends with Jason.

14. The school has expressed concerns to Lindsay about Emily’s inconsistent attendance, impact on her learning, and the risk of further academic decline if the pattern continues.

15. In addition to the missed Mondays, Jason regularly refuses or fails to bring Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions that fall during his parenting time on weekends.

16. Emily’s tutoring sessions were arranged for the purpose of supporting her academic progress and addressing the decline in her grades and test scores, making regular attendance of those sessions particularly important.

17. Jason’s refusal or failure to bring Emily to tutoring sessions has further undermined the efforts to address Emily’s educational difficulties and has negatively affected her academic performance.

18. These attendance and tutoring issues did not exist when the April 15, 2022 Judgment was entered, and they represent new and substantial developments.

19. The pattern of keeping Emily out of school on Mondays and failing to take her to tutoring constitutes a material change in circumstances not contemplated by the Court at the time of the prior Judgment.

20. This conduct significantly impacts Emily’s education and overall welfare, and it interferes with the parties’ ability to exercise joint legal custody in a manner consistent with Emily’s best interests.

21. The Defendant’s actions undermine the cooperative decision‑making required under joint legal custody and demonstrate an ongoing inability or unwillingness to prioritize Emily’s educational needs during his parenting time.

22. Because Emily is now of school age and subject to compulsory attendance laws under G.L. c. 76, §§ 1–2, the Defendant’s recurring failure to ensure her attendance on Mondays and at tutoring sessions has more serious legal and practical consequences than any attendance issues that may have existed when she was younger.

23. The totality of these circumstances—chronic Monday absences, truancy warnings, declining academic performance, and missed tutoring—constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28, warranting modification of the prior custody and parenting‑time orders.

24. Continued adherence to the existing Judgment, without modification geared to Emily’s schooling, exposes Emily to further academic harm, the risk of school‑based interventions for truancy, and increased parental conflict over educational decisions.

25. It is therefore necessary and appropriate for the Court to modify the existing custody and parenting‑time orders to protect Emily’s educational stability and best interests.

       IV.   APPLICABLE LAW AND BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

26. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court “may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where the modification is in the best interests of the child.

27. Massachusetts courts have long held that a modification of custody or related orders requires (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment and (2) that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:

   a. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (modification requires material change in circumstances and best interests of child);

   b. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests of the child are the “touchstone” of custody determinations);

   c. Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000) (modification appropriate where parent’s conduct adversely affects child’s welfare);

   d. Stevens v. Stevens, 337 Mass. 625 (1958) (material change required before modification of custody);

   e. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (demonstrated change in circumstances and detriment to child warrant modification).

28. The Massachusetts appellate courts emphasize that the best interests of the child encompass the child’s physical, emotional, and educational welfare. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (court must consider “emotional, intellectual, moral and physical needs” of child).

29. Joint legal custody presupposes the parents’ “ability and willingness to cooperate in making major decisions for the child,” including decisions regarding education and schooling. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (joint custody appropriate only where parents can cooperate and communicate effectively about the child’s welfare).

30. Where parents are unable to cooperate on important issues or where one parent consistently acts in a way that undermines the child’s welfare, it is appropriate for the Court to modify the existing orders and allocate decision‑making authority to one parent. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 547–49 (2010) (court may modify custody if joint custody no longer serves child’s best interests); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183–86 (2006) (modification to address changed circumstances impacting child’s best interests).

31. The child’s educational stability and regular school attendance are central components of her best interests and are explicitly protected by Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 76, § 1 (compulsory school attendance); G.L. c. 119, § 51A (educational neglect as a potential form of neglect).

32. A pattern of absences and academic decline attributable to a parent’s decisions during that parent’s parenting time can justify modification of custody or parenting time to protect the child’s educational welfare. See Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 242–43 (modification appropriate where parental conduct affected child’s schooling and emotional health); Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 60–63 (2016) (court may modify parenting plan when existing arrangement is detrimental to child’s stability and development).

33. In deciding whether to grant a complaint for modification, the Court may consider the pattern of a parent’s conduct and its effect on the child’s educational prospects and overall well‑being, rather than waiting for irreparable harm. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–97; D.M. v. M.M., 91 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2017) (Rule 1:28 decision) (affirming modification where existing orders were no longer in child’s best interests).

34. Here, Lindsay has demonstrated a material and substantial change in circumstances since the April 15, 2022 Judgment: Emily now struggles with school attendance, truancy concerns, declining grades, and missed tutoring, all of which arise primarily during or as a result of Jason’s exercise of parenting time and his unilateral decisions about school attendance.

35. Jason’s conduct is inconsistent with the cooperative joint decision‑making required by joint legal custody, as well as with Emily’s educational needs and the statutory requirements for school attendance.

36. The current arrangement—where Jason has Sunday overnights and substantial weekend time that overlaps with school obligations, and where neither parent has final decision‑making authority on school attendance—has become detrimental to Emily’s educational progress and stability.

37. Modifying the existing Judgment to (a) grant Lindsay final decision‑making authority (tie‑breaking authority) over educational and school‑attendance decisions, and/or (b) adjust Jason’s parenting time so that Emily is in Lindsay’s care on Sunday nights during the school year, directly addresses the identified problems and promotes Emily’s best interests.

38. Such a modification is narrowly tailored to the changed circumstances and is consistent with Massachusetts law allowing the Court to alter custody and parenting‑time arrangements to protect a child’s educational welfare. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–46; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. at 183–86.

39. Accordingly, it is in Emily’s best interests that the Court modify the existing custody and parenting‑time orders to (a) grant Lindsay final decision‑making authority regarding Emily’s education and school attendance, and/or (b) reduce or eliminate Jason’s school‑night overnights, particularly Sunday overnights during the school year, so as to ensure consistent school attendance and participation in tutoring.

                     V.   REQUESTED MODIFICATION ORDERS

40. Lindsay respectfully requests that this Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the April 15, 2022 Judgment and that modification is in Emily’s best interests, and enter modified orders including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:

   a. Legal Custody / Educational Decision‑Making  
      i. That the parties shall continue to share joint legal custody, but that Lindsay shall have final decision‑making authority (tie‑breaking authority) with respect to Emily’s education, including but not limited to:  
         1. School selection and enrollment within the public school system;  
         2. Decisions regarding school attendance, including whether Emily will be absent or dismissed from school;  
         3. Participation in tutoring, academic support services, and school‑related interventions.  
      ii. In the alternative, if the Court finds joint legal custody no longer serves Emily’s best interests regarding educational matters, that Lindsay be granted sole legal custody as to educational decisions only, with joint legal custody otherwise remaining in effect.

   b. Parenting Time / Sunday Overnights  
      i. That during the school year (defined as the published school calendar for Emily’s school), Jason’s Sunday overnights be eliminated or modified so that Emily shall return to Lindsay’s care by a time reasonably calculated to ensure her attendance at school on Monday morning, such as by 6:00 p.m. on Sundays;  
      ii. That the parenting‑time schedule be adjusted as necessary so that Jason’s overnights do not regularly precede school days, unless and until he demonstrates consistent compliance with school‑attendance requirements and tutoring obligations, as found by the Court;  
      iii. That holiday, vacation, and summer schedules may continue to allow for overnights preceding non‑school days, provided that such time does not interfere with Emily’s tutoring or remedial educational services, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

   c. Tutoring and Academic Support  
      i. That both parents be ordered to ensure that Emily attends all scheduled tutoring sessions and school‑recommended academic support services during their respective parenting time, except in cases of genuine illness or emergency;  
      ii. That any cancellation of tutoring be agreed upon in writing (email or text) by both parents in advance, absent emergency, and that the cancelled session be rescheduled as soon as reasonably possible.

   d. Attendance and Communication  
      i. That both parents be ordered to comply with all applicable compulsory school attendance laws, including G.L. c. 76, § 1;  
      ii. That neither parent shall keep Emily out of school or cause her to be tardy or dismissed absent (1) genuine illness or emergency, or (2) prior mutual written agreement, except where a treating medical or mental health provider has directed otherwise;  
      iii. That each parent shall promptly inform the other, in writing (email or text), of any absences, tardies, or dismissals on days when Emily is in their care, including the stated reason;  
      iv. That each parent shall promptly provide the other with copies of any truancy notices, attendance warnings, progress reports, and report cards received from the school.

   e. Additional Relief  
      i. That the Court incorporate these modified provisions into a new Parenting Plan or Judgment of Modification;  
      ii. That the Court schedule such review or status conferences as may be appropriate to monitor compliance with school attendance and tutoring obligations;  
      iii. That the Court grant such further relief as it deems just and proper to protect Emily’s educational welfare and best interests.

                                   VI.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the April 15, 2022 Judgment regarding custody and parenting time, particularly concerning Emily’s school attendance, academic performance, and educational stability;

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time orders is necessary and in the best interests of Emily pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including Custody of Vaughn, Custody of Kali, Custody of Zia, Mason v. Coleman, Smith v. McDonald, Ardizoni v. Raymond, and related authorities;

C. Modify the April 15, 2022 Judgment to grant Lindsay final decision‑making authority (tie‑breaking authority) with respect to Emily’s education, school attendance, and tutoring, while otherwise maintaining joint legal custody, or, in the alternative, grant Lindsay sole legal custody as to educational matters;

D. Modify Jason’s parenting time, including elimination or adjustment of Sunday overnights and other school‑night overnights during the school year, so as to ensure Emily’s consistent school attendance and participation in tutoring and other academic support services;

E. Order both parents to comply with all compulsory attendance laws, ensure Emily’s attendance at scheduled tutoring and academic support services, and cooperate in good faith regarding Emily’s educational needs;

F. Enter a Judgment of Modification and amended Parenting Plan consistent with the foregoing;

G. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.

Respectfully submitted,

LINDSAY CARTER,
