                                   PARTIES

1.   Plaintiff Jason Callahan (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father and natural guardian of his minor son, [MINOR SON] (hereinafter “Minor Child”), who was eight (8) years old on September 15, 2023.

2.   Plaintiff brings this action individually for medical expenses and related damages incurred by him and as parent and next friend of his Minor Child for the personal injuries suffered by the Minor Child.

3.   Upon information and belief, Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant” or “Community Center”) is a community-based organization operating an after‑school program in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, with a principal place of business at or near 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA.

4.   At all relevant times, Defendant owned, operated, managed, controlled, and/or was otherwise responsible for the community center facility and after‑school program located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA, including the gymnasium and supervision of children enrolled in its programs.



                         JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.   This is an action sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

6.   Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 19A and related provisions, in that the amount of damages sought is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court Department.

7.   Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, because the cause of action arose in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, where the Defendant conducts business and where the incident giving rise to this action occurred.



                              STATEMENT OF FACTS

8.   At all relevant times, Defendant operated an after‑school program for children at its facility located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA (the “Premises”).

9.   Defendant advertised, represented, and held out to parents, including Plaintiff, that children enrolled in its after‑school program would be supervised at all times while in the gym and other activity areas.

10.  Relying on Defendant’s representations and assurances of adequate supervision and safety, Plaintiff enrolled his Minor Child in the after‑school program at the Community Center.

11.  On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s Minor Child was present at the Community Center after-school program and was participating in activities in the gymnasium on the Premises.

12.  On that date and time, approximately twenty (20) children were present in the gymnasium area.

13.  Defendant’s policies and/or standard practices required that at least two staff members be present in the gym to supervise the group of children.

14.  Notwithstanding that requirement, on September 15, 2023, only one staff member remained in the gym while the other staff member left to go to an office to do paperwork, leaving a single staff member with approximately twenty children.

15.  The staff member who remained in the gym was positioned by the bleachers and was largely inattentive to the children, spending significant time looking at her phone rather than actively supervising the children, intervening in unsafe conduct, and enforcing appropriate safety rules.

16.  While the Minor Child and other children were in the gym, two older boys, approximately twelve (12) years old, began engaging in a rough, tackle-style game on the hardwood gym floor.

17.  The rough play by the older, larger boys constituted an obvious and reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to younger, smaller children present in the same area, including Plaintiff’s eight-year-old Minor Child, who was small for his age.

18.  Several children observed the dangerous horseplay and notified the supervising staff member that the older boys were playing roughly and tackling each other on the hardwood floor.

19.  Despite being notified of the dangerous roughhousing, the staff member dismissed the concerns and responded, in substance, that “boys will be boys,” and failed to take any reasonable steps to stop, separate, or control the rough play, to move younger children away from the danger, or otherwise to protect the Minor Child.

20.  Defendant’s staff member failed to adequately monitor the children, failed to intervene in the known dangerous conduct, and failed to implement or enforce any safety rules to prevent injury to younger children in the vicinity.

21.  As a direct and foreseeable result of the lack of adequate supervision and the failure to intervene in the roughhousing, one of the larger boys violently tackled Plaintiff’s Minor Child, causing him to fall and strike his head hard on the hardwood floor.

22.  The Minor Child lost consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

23.  Emergency medical care was required; the Minor Child was transported to, and treated in, an emergency room for a concussion and related head injury.

24.  The Minor Child was diagnosed with a concussion and was required to miss several days of school and physical activities.

25.  Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for evaluation and treatment of the Minor Child’s injuries in the approximate amount of Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500.00), and will likely incur additional medical and related expenses in the future.

26.  As a result of the concussion and incident, the Minor Child suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, and emotional distress, including but not limited to fear, anxiety, and distress associated with gym activities and group play.

27.  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant, by and through its agents, servants, and/or employees, owed Plaintiff’s Minor Child a duty to exercise reasonable care in the supervision, control, and protection of children participating in its after-school program and using its gym facilities.

28.  Defendant’s failure to provide adequate supervision and its failure to act upon notice of dangerous roughhousing in the gym constituted a breach of that duty.

29.  The injuries to Plaintiff’s Minor Child were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence and were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care.

30.  Plaintiff has complied with all conditions precedent, if any, to the bringing of this action.



                              COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE  
           (On Behalf of Jason Callahan, Individually and as Parent and  
                         Next Friend of Minor Child)

31.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32.  Under Massachusetts common law, a person or entity that invites or permits children onto its premises for organized programs and activities owes those children a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect them from foreseeable harm, including harm arising from dangerous activities by other children on the premises. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

33.  Defendant, as the operator of an after‑school program and as possessor and controller of the Premises, owed Plaintiff’s Minor Child a duty to act as a reasonably prudent operator of such a program would act under the circumstances, including by:

     a.   Ensuring adequate and attentive adult supervision in the gym at all times when children were present;

     b.   Implementing and enforcing reasonable safety policies and rules governing play in the gym;

     c.   Monitoring for and promptly intervening in dangerous roughhousing or other conduct creating unreasonable risk of harm; and

     d.   Protecting younger, smaller children from foreseeable risks posed by significantly older or larger children engaging in rough or violent play.

34.  Massachusetts law imposes on landowners and operators a duty to take reasonable steps to protect lawful visitors, including children, from reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, including risks created by third parties, where the owner knows or should know of the danger. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); Lynn v. Pegasus Holdings, 449 Mass. 345 (2007); Whittaker v. Saraceno, 418 Mass. 196 (1994).

35.  Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, liability in negligence is determined by whether Defendant failed to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under like circumstances, and whether such failure was a proximate cause of the injury.

36.  The presence of significantly older boys engaging in physical, tackle-style roughhousing on a hardwood gym floor in close proximity to much younger children, including the Minor Child, created an unreasonable and obvious risk of physical injury that a reasonably prudent supervisor would have recognized and addressed.

37.  Defendant, acting through its staff and employees, had actual notice of the dangerous conduct, because other children explicitly reported the rough, tackle-style play to the staff member on duty.

38.  Despite such notice, the staff member, acting within the scope of her employment, responded dismissively (“boys will be boys”) and failed to take any reasonable precautions to stop the conduct, separate the participants, or otherwise protect the Minor Child from foreseeable harm.

39.  Defendant further increased the risk of harm by allowing one of the two scheduled supervisors to leave the gym to perform paperwork, leaving a single, inattentive staff member to oversee approximately twenty children.

40.  In these circumstances, a reasonably prudent operator of an after-school program, mindful of the special vulnerability of young children and the well‑recognized need for active supervision in gym environments, would have:

     a.   Required that both staff members remain present and actively supervise the children in the gym;

     b.   Promptly intervened to stop the rough tackling game upon learning of it;

     c.   Separated older, larger children from younger, smaller children during physical play;

     d.   Removed the roughhousing children from the gym or imposed appropriate discipline; and/or

     e.   Implemented and enforced rules prohibiting tackle-style or violent physical play on the hardwood floor.

41.  Defendant’s failure to take any of these reasonable steps, despite actual notice of the dangerous activity, constituted a breach of its duty of care owed to Plaintiff and his Minor Child. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm); Luoni v. Berube, 431 Mass. 729 (2000).

42.  The injuries suffered by the Minor Child were a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s negligent supervision and would not have occurred but for Defendant’s breach of duty. See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., 408 Mass. 355 (1990); Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996).

43.  Under Massachusetts law, children are considered particularly vulnerable, and entities that undertake to supervise and care for children are held to a standard of reasonable care commensurate with that undertaking. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983); Remy v. MacDonald, 440 Mass. 675 (2004) (recognizing special duties in caretaking relationships).

44.  Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, by and through its employees acting within the scope of their employment, include, without limitation:

     a.   Failing to provide adequate adult supervision in the gym, including by allowing one of two scheduled staff members to leave the area, contrary to reasonable practice and safety;

     b.   Failing to actively observe and monitor the children, including spending significant time on a personal phone instead of supervising;

     c.   Failing to respond reasonably to direct complaints by children that dangerous roughhousing and tackle-style play was occurring;

     d.   Failing to stop or intervene in obvious, dangerous horseplay that posed a risk of serious physical injury to younger children;

     e.   Failing to segregate older, larger children from younger, smaller children when engaging in physical play;

     f.   Failing to establish, implement, or enforce appropriate rules and policies to prevent tackle-style or violent play on the hardwood floor;

     g.   Failing to train and supervise staff adequately with respect to child safety and appropriate responses to dangerous conduct; and

     h.   Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care under all of the circumstances.

45.  Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and servants under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assoc., Inc., 438 Mass. 317 (2002).

46.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s Minor Child suffered a concussion and related head injury, with resulting pain and suffering, medical treatment, school absences, limitations on normal activities, and emotional distress.

47.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff, as parent of the Minor Child, has incurred and will continue to incur medical and related expenses for the care and treatment of the Minor Child in an amount presently estimated at approximately Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500.00), exclusive of future medical and related costs. See G.L. c. 231, § 85K (recognizing liability of charitable organizations for negligence within statutory limits, if applicable).

48.  Under Massachusetts law, parents are entitled to recover medical expenses incurred on behalf of their minor children as a result of another’s negligence. See, e.g., McCann v. Middleborough, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 811 (1973) (rescript); G.L. c. 231, § 85A (evidentiary presumption of agency/ownership).

49.  The Minor Child has suffered and will continue to suffer damages including, but not limited to, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, physical and emotional distress, and impairment of his ability to engage fully in age‑appropriate activities, for which Plaintiff, as parent and next friend, seeks recovery on his behalf.

50.  No negligence of Plaintiff or of the Minor Child was a cause of the injuries; even if any comparative negligence were alleged, Plaintiff’s and/or the Minor Child’s negligence, if any, was less than that of Defendant, so that recovery is not barred and must be diminished only in proportion to such negligence, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85.

51.  Defendant’s conduct was unreasonable under all of the circumstances, violated the standard of ordinary care owed to children under its supervision, and directly caused the injuries and damages described herein.

52.  Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from Defendant for all losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including medical expenses, pain and suffering of the Minor Child, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other compensable damages recognized under Massachusetts law.



                               PRAYER FOR RELIEF
