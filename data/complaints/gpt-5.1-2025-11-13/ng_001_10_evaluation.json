In this opinion, however, the Massachusetts SJC expressly holds that, in negligence, emotional distress is not recoverable absent physical harm, and the cited pages (547\u2013548) are part of the court\u2019s explanation of why such standalone emotional-distress claims are barred. While Payton discusses parasitic recovery for emotional distress when there is physical injury, it does not focus on or articulate the broad damages formulation in the proposition, and the specific citation is more about limiting rather than expanding emotional-distress recovery.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe conclude that when recovery is sought for negligent, rather than intentional or reckless, infliction of emotional distress, evidence must be introduced that the plaintiff has suffered physical harm. \u2026 In summary, we hold that a plaintiff in order to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress must prove the following: (1) negligence; (2) emotional distress; (3) causation; (4) physical harm manifested by objective symptomatology; and (5) that a reasonable person would have suffered emotional distress under the circumstances of the case.\u201d (pp. 556\u2013557)"
