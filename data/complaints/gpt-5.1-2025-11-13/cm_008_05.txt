  Plaintiff,  

v.  

DAVID THOMPSON,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
Docket No.: __________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows in support of her Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Court’s inherent equitable powers:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, David Thompson (“Defendant” or “Father”), upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the father of the minor child, Emily Thompson.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child, Emily Thompson, born ____________, currently age 10.

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over the parties and over the custody and parenting time orders at issue pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, G.L. c. 215, § 6, and the prior Judgment of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the existing custody and parenting-time orders were entered in this Court, the Plaintiff resides in this county, and the minor child resides primarily with the Plaintiff within this county.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT

6. On or about April 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor child, Emily Thompson (the “2022 Judgment”).

7. Under the 2022 Judgment, the parties share joint legal custody of Emily Thompson, with the Plaintiff designated as the primary residential parent.

8. Under the 2022 Judgment, the Defendant was granted substantial weekend parenting time with Emily, including Sunday overnight parenting time, resulting in Emily being in the Defendant’s care on Sunday nights and returning to school on Mondays from the Defendant’s home.

9. The 2022 Judgment also requires that the parties cooperate on school matters, keep each other informed regarding the minor child’s education, and make joint decisions concerning educational issues in accordance with their joint legal custody.

10. At the time the 2022 Judgment was entered, Emily was doing well in school, her school attendance was regular, and there were no truancy warnings or significant academic concerns.

11. The 2022 Judgment remains in full force and effect and has not previously been modified with respect to legal custody or the Sunday overnight schedule.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the 2022 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s welfare and best interests, warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

13. Over approximately the past year, during the Defendant’s regular weekend parenting time, including Sunday nights, the Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekends.

14. The Defendant characterizes these Monday absences as “mental health days,” but he has not obtained or produced any doctor’s notes, treatment plans, or other medical or mental-health documentation to justify repeated school absences, and there is no current court order authorizing such absences.

15. These Monday absences have occurred on multiple occasions and have been sufficiently frequent that the school has issued truancy warnings regarding Emily’s attendance.

16. As a result of the repeated Monday absences while in the Defendant’s care, Emily’s attendance record has become problematic, and she has been flagged by the school for excessive unexcused or insufficiently excused absences.

17. The Plaintiff has been contacted by the school and has received truancy warnings and communications expressing concern that Emily’s repeated Monday absences are adversely affecting her education.

18. During roughly the same period, Emily’s grades and standardized test scores have declined, and school personnel have indicated that her attendance issues and missed instruction are contributing to this decline.

19. The Plaintiff has arranged for tutoring services and other academic supports for Emily, including tutoring sessions that sometimes fall during the Defendant’s weekend parenting time.

20. The Defendant has on a regular basis refused or failed to bring Emily to her scheduled tutoring sessions when they occur during his parenting time, despite the Plaintiff’s notice to him of these appointments and their importance to Emily’s academic progress.

21. The Defendant’s repeated refusal and/or failure to ensure Emily’s attendance at school on Mondays and at scheduled tutoring sessions has interfered with her education and is contrary to her best interests.

22. The Defendant’s conduct also violates the spirit and intent of the joint legal custody arrangement set forth in the 2022 Judgment, which requires cooperation on school matters and keeping each other informed for the benefit of the child.

23. The Plaintiff has attempted to address these issues with the Defendant by requesting that he ensure Emily attends school on Mondays and that he cooperate in having her attend tutoring during his weekends, but the Defendant has continued his pattern of non‑compliance.

24. The parties are now in regular disagreement regarding educational decisions, especially concerning school attendance and tutoring, and are unable to effectively share joint decision‑making authority on these issues in a manner that protects Emily’s educational needs.

25. As a direct result of these developments, the current joint legal custody arrangement—without any provision granting the Plaintiff final decision‑making authority on educational matters—and the current Sunday overnight schedule with the Defendant are no longer serving Emily’s best interests.

26. The patterns described above constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2022 Judgment, and they have a direct and negative impact on the minor child’s educational welfare and overall best interests.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD AND APPLICABLE LAW

27. Under Massachusetts law, existing custody and parenting‑time orders may be modified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

28. The paramount consideration in any modification of custody or parenting time is the best interests of the child. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003); Vilakazi v. Maxie, 371 Mass. 406 (1976).

29. A pattern of parental conduct that undermines a child’s education, including chronic unexcused absences and failure to support educational services, can constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances justifying modification of custody or legal‑decision‑making authority, because such conduct directly affects the child’s welfare. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (court may modify custody where circumstances affecting children’s welfare have changed); Diaz v. Diaz, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 504, 506–07 (1998).

30. Where parents with joint legal custody are unable to cooperate or make shared decisions on critical issues such as education, the Court may modify the allocation of legal‑custody authority, including by granting one parent final decision‑making power on specific issues, when doing so is in the child’s best interests. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 547–48; Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 330–33 (2007).

31. The Court has broad discretion to adjust parenting‑time schedules, including weekday and school‑night overnights, to protect a child’s educational needs and stability. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998) (trial court has “considerable discretion” in fashioning custody and visitation orders); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404.

32. In determining the best interests of a child, the Court may consider the child’s educational needs, attendance, school performance, and each parent’s willingness and ability to meet those needs. See Custody of a Minor, 383 Mass. 595, 602–03 (1981); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–45.

33. A parent’s pattern of disregarding school requirements, failing to support necessary educational interventions, or creating truancy risks may weigh against that parent in allocating legal‑custody authority or school‑night parenting time. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. at 547–48; Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. at 332–33; Cooper v. Cooper, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 168, 174–75 (2021).

34. The Court also has authority, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 31, to make orders regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time that are “in the best interests of the children,” which includes tailoring school‑night parenting schedules to ensure consistent school attendance.

35. To the extent the Court deems this matter within G.L. c. 209C, the same best‑interests and material‑change standards apply. See G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10, 20; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996).

36. In light of the statutory framework and the cases cited above, the Defendant’s repeated interference with Emily’s school attendance, his failure to bring her to tutoring during his weekends, and the resulting truancy concerns and academic decline constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances that directly affects Emily’s welfare and justifies the requested modification.

### V. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

37. Emily’s repeated Monday absences while in the Defendant’s care, without medical documentation or educational justification, place her at risk of truancy proceedings and undermine her academic progress.

38. The school’s truancy warnings and noted decline in Emily’s grades and test scores are objective indicators that her educational welfare is being harmed.

39. The Defendant’s refusal and/or failure to bring Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions during his parenting time further interferes with the remedial measures the Plaintiff has arranged to address Emily’s academic difficulties.

40. The parties’ disputes over school attendance and tutoring demonstrate that they can no longer effectively exercise joint legal custody with respect to educational decisions, particularly where the Defendant’s unilateral decisions are causing harm to Emily’s schooling.

41. Granting the Plaintiff final decision‑making authority over educational matters (including school attendance, tutoring, and related services) is a narrowly tailored and appropriate modification designed to protect Emily’s best interests while leaving the underlying joint‑custody framework in place to the extent it remains workable.

42. In the alternative, or in addition, reducing or eliminating the Defendant’s Sunday‑night overnights so that Emily is in the Plaintiff’s care on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings will materially improve Emily’s school attendance and allow the Plaintiff to ensure that Emily attends school consistently on Mondays.

43. Either or both of these modifications—granting the Plaintiff final say on educational decisions and/or reducing the Defendant’s school‑night overnights—are consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the case law cited herein and are squarely in Emily’s best interests.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the April 15, 2022 Judgment concerning custody and parenting time for Emily Thompson;

B. Find that it is in the best interests of Emily Thompson that the existing Judgment be modified;

C. Modify the current orders for custody and parenting time to provide that:

   1. Legal Custody / Educational Decision‑Making  
      a. The parties shall continue to share joint legal custody of Emily Thompson.  
      b. However, with respect to educational issues—including but not limited to school attendance, decisions about whether Emily will attend school on scheduled school days, tutoring, homework support programs, special education services (if applicable), and other academic interventions—the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, shall have final decision‑making authority after good‑faith consultation with the Defendant.  
      c. The Defendant shall cooperate with and support the educational decisions made by the Plaintiff pursuant to her final decision‑making authority and shall ensure that Emily’s school attendance and participation in agreed‑upon educational services (including tutoring) are maintained during his parenting time.

   2. Sunday‑Night and School‑Night Overnights  
      a. In order to protect Emily’s school attendance and academic performance, the Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time shall be modified so that Emily returns to the Plaintiff’s care on Sunday at a reasonable time (for example, no later than 6:00 p.m.), or at such other specific time as the Court deems appropriate.  
      b. Alternatively, or in addition, the Court may order that the Defendant shall not have school‑night overnights (including Sunday nights before a school day), and that Emily shall be in the Plaintiff’s care on all evenings prior to school days to ensure regular attendance.

   3. Educational Cooperation  
      a. Both parties shall comply with all compulsory‑attendance laws and school requirements, including providing timely documentation if Emily is legitimately ill and unable to attend school.  
      b. Both parties shall ensure that Emily attends all scheduled school days, absent legitimate illness or emergency, and shall cooperate in ensuring she attends tutoring and other educational services as scheduled, regardless of which parent has parenting time.  
      c. Both parties shall promptly exchange information concerning Emily’s grades, report cards, attendance records, school notices (including truancy notices), and testing results, and shall each be entitled to full access to school records and school personnel.

D. Enter any further orders, including any temporary orders if appropriate, to stabilize Emily’s school attendance and educational supports pending final hearing on this Complaint for Modification;

E. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.
