  Plaintiff,  

v.                    
JESSICA DAVIS,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

Docket No.: __________________

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related authority)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, David Ramirez (“Plaintiff” or “Father”), self‑represented, and respectfully complains and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, David Ramirez, is an individual residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children Emily Ramirez (date of birth: __________, age 10) and Noah Ramirez (date of birth: __________, age 8) (collectively, the “minor children”).

2. The Defendant, Jessica Davis (“Defendant” or “Mother”), upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters involving the minor children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable Massachusetts law, because a prior judgment concerning legal and physical custody and parenting time was issued by this Court.

4. Venue is proper in the Berkshire County Probate and Family Court under G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the prior judgment was entered in this division and the parties and minor children reside within this Court’s jurisdiction.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

5. On or about June 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment (or Judgment of Divorce/Separate Support/Custody, as applicable) (the “Existing Judgment”) establishing, among other matters, legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor children.

6. Under the Existing Judgment, the Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody of the minor children, with the Defendant receiving parenting time consisting of alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

7. At the time the Existing Judgment was entered, neither party was in a serious relationship or cohabiting with a romantic partner, and there were no specific provisions concerning exposure of the minor children to new partners, household members, or persons with criminal or violent histories.

### IV. STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

8. A Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting‑time judgment when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is necessary to protect and promote the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215 (2002).

9. In determining whether to modify custody or parenting time, the paramount consideration is the best interests of the child, including the child’s safety, emotional well‑being, and stability. See Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–42 (2003); Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243 (2000).

10. Exposure of children to domestic violence, unsafe caregivers, or a household environment involving a pattern of yelling, intimidation, and physical aggression is directly relevant to the best‑interests determination and can constitute a material and substantial change warranting modification. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 208, § 28; C.O. v. M.O., 401 Mass. 559 (1988); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43.

11. Courts are empowered to impose conditions on parenting time, including restrictions on the presence of third parties or orders for supervised parenting time, where necessary to safeguard the welfare of the children. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232, 233–34 (1981); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981); Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 658–60 (2002).

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

12. Since entry of the Existing Judgment on June 15, 2021, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances relating to the safety and welfare of the minor children during the Defendant’s parenting time.

13. After the Existing Judgment was entered, the Defendant began a serious relationship with and moved in with an adult individual (hereinafter, “the Cohabitant”).

14. The Defendant now resides with the Cohabitant, and, upon information and belief, the Cohabitant is a regular presence in the home when the minor children are exercising parenting time with the Defendant, including overnights.

15. Upon information and belief, the Cohabitant has a criminal record that includes at least one conviction, admission to sufficient facts, or continuance without a finding for assault and battery, in violation of G.L. c. 265, § 13A, or a substantially similar offense.

16. Upon information and belief, the Cohabitant has previously been the subject of a restraining order (abuse prevention order) under G.L. c. 209A obtained by a prior romantic partner or girlfriend, arising from alleged abusive or violent conduct.

17. The Cohabitant’s documented history of assault and battery and prior G.L. c. 209A restraining order reflects a pattern of violent or abusive behavior that is directly relevant to the safety of the minor children and the suitability of the Defendant’s household during parenting time. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 209A; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

18. Emily and Noah have reported to the Plaintiff that the Cohabitant frequently yells, uses an aggressive tone, and slams doors in the home during the Defendant’s parenting time.

19. On at least one occasion, one of the minor children reported that the Cohabitant grabbed the child by the arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark on the child’s arm.

20. The Plaintiff personally observed the mark on the child’s arm shortly after the incident was reported. The child stated that the Cohabitant was the person who grabbed the child.

21. The Plaintiff is informed and believes that during a loud argument in the home of the Defendant and the Cohabitant, while the minor children were present, a neighbor called the police to respond to the disturbance.

22. The involvement of law enforcement due to loud and aggressive arguments in the presence of the minor children further demonstrates that the environment during the Defendant’s parenting time has become volatile and potentially unsafe.

23. The pattern of yelling, slamming doors, physical grabbing of a child, and police involvement, combined with the Cohabitant’s criminal record for assault and battery and prior G.L. c. 209A restraining order, constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the Existing Judgment.

24. At the time of the Existing Judgment, the Court did not consider, and could not have considered, the impact of the Defendant’s current cohabiting partner on the minor children because that relationship and living arrangement did not then exist.

25. The new circumstances—specifically the Defendant’s cohabitation with a person who has a documented violent history and who has allegedly engaged in aggressive and physically harmful conduct toward one of the children—materially alters the risk profile and safety of the minor children during the Defendant’s parenting time.

26. These developments were not anticipated by the parties or the Court at the time of the Existing Judgment and cannot be adequately addressed under the current parenting‑time provisions.

27. Accordingly, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that justifies and necessitates modification of the Existing Judgment to protect and promote the minor children’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590; Champion v. Champion, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 215; Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

28. The best interests of Emily and Noah require that they be protected from exposure to domestic conflict, aggressive behavior, and individuals with recent or significant histories of violent conduct. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–43; Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. at 243.

29. Massachusetts law requires the Court to give special attention to any pattern or serious incident of abuse when making custody and parenting‑time determinations, including modifications. See G.L. c. 208, § 31A; G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209A; C.O. v. M.O., 401 Mass. 559.

30. The presence of the Cohabitant, with a criminal record for assault and battery and a past restraining order, coupled with the alleged physical grabbing of one of the minor children and a household atmosphere of yelling and slamming doors, poses a risk of emotional and physical harm to Emily and Noah.

31. The minor children are at important developmental stages (ages approximately 10 and 8), and repeated exposure to conflict, aggressive behavior, or unsafe caregivers may cause lasting psychological and emotional harm.

32. The Plaintiff does not seek to eliminate or unreasonably restrict the Defendant’s relationship with the minor children, but rather to place appropriate and narrowly tailored conditions on the Defendant’s parenting time so as to protect the children while preserving their bond with the Defendant. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. at 233–34; Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05; Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. at 658–60.

33. Reasonable protective conditions may include: (a) prohibiting the presence of the Cohabitant during any parenting time between the Defendant and the minor children; and/or (b) ordering that the Defendant’s parenting time occur in a supervised setting until the Court is satisfied that the Cohabitant does not pose a risk to the children or until further order of the Court.

34. Such conditions are consistent with the Court’s duty to prioritize the children’s safety and well‑being, and they are less restrictive than a complete suspension or termination of parenting time.

35. Modification of the Existing Judgment to impose these reasonable conditions would serve the best interests of the minor children and is justified based on the material and substantial changes described above.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, David Ramirez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the Existing Judgment dated June 15, 2021, due to the Defendant’s cohabitation with a person who has a criminal history for assault and battery and a prior G.L. c. 209A restraining order, as well as reported incidents of yelling, slamming doors, physical grabbing of one of the children, and police involvement during the Defendant’s parenting time;

B. Find that modification of the Existing Judgment is necessary to protect and promote the best interests of the minor children, Emily Ramirez and Noah Ramirez, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31, 31A and applicable case law, including Custody of Vaughn, Custody of Kali, Smith v. McDonald, and related authorities;

C. Modify the Existing Judgment to include an order that, until further order of the Court, the Defendant’s cohabiting partner (the Cohabitant) shall not be present in the same residence, vehicle, or location as the minor children during any and all periods of parenting time exercised by the Defendant;

D. In the alternative, or in addition, order that all of the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by a neutral third‑party supervisor, a professional supervised‑visitation center, or another party approved by the Court, until such time as the Court is satisfied that the minor children can safely have unsupervised parenting time with the Defendant;

E. Order that the Defendant shall not permit the minor children to be left alone with, or in the care or custody of, the Cohabitant at any time;

F. Order such further conditions as the Court deems necessary and appropriate to ensure the safety and emotional well‑being of the minor children, including but not limited to: (1) requiring the Defendant and/or the Cohabitant to complete an anger‑management program, parenting education, or domestic‑violence‑related counseling as the Court may order; and (2) requiring the Defendant to promptly notify the Plaintiff and the Court of any further police involvement, restraining orders, or allegations of abuse arising in the Defendant’s household;

G. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief, temporary or permanent, as this Honorable Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor children.

Respectfully submitted,
