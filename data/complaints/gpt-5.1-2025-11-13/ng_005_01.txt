### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PROPERTY DAMAGE ONLY)

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Mark Reynolds (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

## I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts.

2. On information and belief, Defendant Mark Reynolds is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and is Plaintiff’s neighbor in a duplex residence sharing a common driveway.

---

## II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action seeking monetary damages in excess of $50,000 for negligence resulting in damage to Plaintiff’s automobile and associated consequential losses.

4. The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, which vests the Superior Court with original jurisdiction of civil actions where the likely recovery exceeds $50,000.

5. Venue is proper in Hampden County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2 because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Hampden County.

---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Defendant resided in a duplex property located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and shared a common driveway providing access to their respective parking areas.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, or controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder (the “Ladder”).

8. For an extended period prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant routinely stored and left the Ladder in an upright, freestanding or leaning position against a wooden fence immediately adjacent to the shared driveway and in close proximity to the area where Plaintiff regularly parked her vehicle.

9. The Ladder was of substantial height and weight, and if it were to fall, it posed a foreseeable risk of causing property damage or personal injury to persons or vehicles using the shared driveway.

10. Plaintiff routinely parked her automobile (the “Vehicle”) in a parking space in the shared driveway immediately next to the wooden fence where Defendant stored and left the Ladder.

11. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff personally observed that the Ladder appeared unstable and at risk of falling, especially during periods of high wind.

12. On multiple occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed to Defendant her concern that the Ladder might fall over onto her Vehicle, particularly on windy days.

13. Plaintiff specifically warned Defendant that the Ladder was dangerous as stored, and asked that he either move the Ladder to a safer location or securely tie it down or otherwise stabilize it so that it would not fall.

14. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and, on information and belief, agreed or represented that he would tie down, move, or otherwise secure the Ladder.

15. Notwithstanding these warnings and his assurances, Defendant failed to tie down, move, or otherwise adequately secure the Ladder prior to March 15, 2023.

16. On March 15, 2023, at approximately a time during daylight hours, strong winds affected the Springfield area, creating gusty conditions.

17. On that date, Plaintiff was backing her Vehicle into the shared driveway parking space adjacent to the wooden fence where Defendant had left the Ladder leaning or standing.

18. While Plaintiff was in the process of backing into the parking space, a gust of wind caused the Ladder to tip and fall away from the fence and toward the driveway area.

19. The Ladder fell directly onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s Vehicle, striking with force.

20. As a direct and proximate result of the Ladder’s fall, the hood of Plaintiff’s Vehicle was dented and the windshield cracked.

21. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was operating her Vehicle in a reasonable and prudent manner and had no reasonable ability to prevent or mitigate the Ladder from falling.

22. The damage to Plaintiff’s Vehicle was not caused by any negligence or fault on the part of Plaintiff.

23. After the incident, Plaintiff promptly arranged for inspection and repair of her Vehicle.

24. Plaintiff’s Vehicle required bodywork to repair the dented hood and the installation of a replacement windshield to restore the Vehicle to its pre-incident condition.

25. Plaintiff was required to pay an automobile insurance deductible out of pocket in order to have the repairs performed.

26. Plaintiff’s Vehicle remained in the repair shop for more than one week, during which time Plaintiff was deprived of the use of her Vehicle.

27. During that period of loss of use, Plaintiff was required to rent a replacement vehicle in order to conduct her ordinary personal and household affairs.

28. Plaintiff incurred reasonable rental car expenses for more than one week while her Vehicle was unavailable due to repairs necessitated by the Ladder incident.

29. Plaintiff has no medical expenses arising from this incident and did not lose wages from employment; her losses are comprised of property damage and related consequential economic damages.

30. At all relevant times, Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning or standing unsecured against a fence immediately adjacent to a shared driveway used daily by Plaintiff posed an unreasonable risk that the ladder would fall and cause property damage or personal injury.

31. It was reasonably foreseeable, and in fact specifically brought to Defendant’s attention by Plaintiff, that the Ladder, if not secured or moved, could be blown over by wind and fall onto Plaintiff’s Vehicle or otherwise cause harm.

32. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to store, secure, or otherwise control the Ladder so as to prevent it from falling into the shared driveway area.

33. The risk that wind might cause an unsecured, tall extension ladder to fall is open, obvious, and well understood by reasonable persons; such risk was, in this case, actually realized.

34. Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the Ladder after repeated warnings from Plaintiff constitutes a failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

35. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s Vehicle sustained physical damage, and Plaintiff sustained out-of-pocket expenses for her insurance deductible and for a rental vehicle, together with associated consequential damages.

36. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial, which Plaintiff reasonably and in good faith estimates to exceed $50,000, including but not limited to the reasonable value of repairs to her Vehicle, the loss of use of her Vehicle, rental car expenses, diminution in value of her Vehicle (if any), and other consequential damages, together with interest and costs.

## IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–36 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

38. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, storage, and control of the Ladder and in maintaining conditions in and around the shared driveway at 123 Maple Street, so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff or her property.

39. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm to others arising from his conduct. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006) (recognizing duty “to exercise reasonable care to avoid physical harm to others” when harm is foreseeable); *Yakubowicz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.*, 404 Mass. 624, 628 (1989).

40. A landowner or possessor of property, including a co-occupant of a shared driveway, owes persons lawfully present a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect them from foreseeable risks of harm. *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973).

41. In addition, a person who creates or maintains a condition on or near real property that poses a foreseeable risk of injury to others using that property has a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent such harm. *Luoni v. Berube*, 431 Mass. 729, 731–33 (2000); *O’Sullivan v. Shaw*, 431 Mass. 201, 204–05 (2000).

42. By storing a tall aluminum extension ladder upright and unsecured next to a shared driveway where Plaintiff routinely parked, Defendant created and maintained a dangerous condition that foreseeably threatened harm to Plaintiff’s Vehicle.

**Breach**

43. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to properly secure the Ladder against falling;  
   b. Failing to store the Ladder in a safe location away from the shared driveway;  
   c. Leaving the Ladder leaning or standing in an unstable manner against a fence directly adjacent to the area where Plaintiff parked;  
   d. Failing to remedy a known hazard after Plaintiff expressly warned him multiple times of the risk that the Ladder might fall and damage her Vehicle; and  
   e. Failing to otherwise act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

44. The standard of care requires a person to act as a reasonably prudent person would under the circumstances. *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000). Defendant’s conduct fell below this standard.

45. Defendant’s failure to take simple, inexpensive, and obvious measures—such as tying down, properly securing, or moving the Ladder—constitutes a breach of his duty of reasonable care. *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 148–49 (duty to take reasonable steps to secure dangerous items when harm is foreseeable).

46. Defendant’s inaction after specific, repeated warnings from Plaintiff further evidences a breach of duty, as Defendant had actual knowledge of the specific risk and failed to correct it. *Afarian v. Massachusetts Elec. Co.*, 449 Mass. 257, 270–71 (2007) (duty heightened where defendant is informed of risk and fails to act).

**Causation**

47. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage and consequential economic losses.

48. But for Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the Ladder, the Ladder would not have fallen onto Plaintiff’s Vehicle, and Plaintiff would not have suffered damage to her hood, windshield, or loss-of-use damages.

49. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—damage to property located in close proximity to an unsecured tall ladder susceptible to being blown over by wind—was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to act reasonably under the circumstances. *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996) (foreseeability of harm is central to proximate cause analysis).

50. There were no intervening or superseding causes sufficient to break the chain of causation between Defendant’s negligence and Plaintiff’s harm. Ordinary wind conditions in March in Springfield, Massachusetts, were plainly foreseeable, and Defendant was specifically warned that wind might cause the Ladder to fall.

**Damages**

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s Vehicle sustained physical damage, including but not limited to:

   a. Dents and deformation to the hood; and  
   b. Cracking and damage to the windshield necessitating replacement.

52. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary costs to repair her Vehicle to its pre-incident condition, including bodywork and windshield replacement, and was required to pay an insurance deductible out of pocket to obtain such repairs.

53. Plaintiff was deprived of the use of her Vehicle for over a week while it was in the repair shop and, as a result, incurred reasonable rental car expenses to secure substitute transportation during that period.

54. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the reasonable costs of repair and loss-of-use damages, including rental expenses, for damage negligently caused to her automobile. *Hopkins v. American Honda Motor Co.*, 431 Mass. 826, 830–31 (2000); *Wallace v. Ludwig*, 292 Mass. 251, 255–56 (1935).

55. Plaintiff also seeks any diminution in value of her Vehicle, if proven at trial, together with all other consequential damages reasonably flowing from Defendant’s negligence. *Mathis v. Massachusetts Elec. Co.*, 409 Mass. 256, 264 (1991).

56. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but in good faith estimates that such damages exceed $50,000, including:

   a. The reasonable cost of repair to her Vehicle;  
   b. The amount of her insurance deductible;  
   c. The reasonable cost of rental car expenses and other loss-of-use damages;  
   d. Any diminution in value to the Vehicle; and  
   e. Prejudgment interest and taxable costs.

57. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any comparative negligence of Plaintiff, if alleged by Defendant, would not bar recovery unless it exceeded 50%, and there is no evidence that Plaintiff was negligent in any respect; in any event, Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was substantially less than that of Defendant.

58. Plaintiff did not create or control the dangerous condition posed by the Ladder, had no authority over Defendant’s storage of the Ladder, and took reasonable steps by warning Defendant multiple times, thereby fulfilling any duty on her part.

59. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s damages. *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002).

60. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment against Defendant for all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with statutory interest and costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest in tort actions) and G.L. c. 235, § 8 (post-judgment interest).
