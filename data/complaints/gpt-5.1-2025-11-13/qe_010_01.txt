**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Sarah Thompson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852 (“the Premises”).

2. Defendant Sarah Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the Premises located at 45 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is an action for breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The amount in controversy is less than $50,000.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–21, because this action arises out of a residential tenancy located in Middlesex County and the damages sought are within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 218, § 19, because the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises since on or about February 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the owner and/or person entitled to possession, control, and receipt of rents for the Premises, and thus is a “landlord” within the meaning of Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186.

10. The apartment’s bathroom is an interior bathroom with no window and relies solely on a mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation.

11. At some point during Plaintiff’s tenancy, mold began to grow in the bathroom, initially appearing in the corner of the shower area.

12. Over time, the mold growth spread beyond the initial area in the shower to portions of the bathroom ceiling and surrounding surfaces.

13. The mold growth in the bathroom constitutes a condition of dampness, chronic moisture, and visible mold that is hazardous to health and renders the Premises less fit for human habitation.

14. The presence of mold and excessive moisture constitutes a condition that violates the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.020 (requiring a dwelling to be “in good repair, clean and free from chronic dampness, mold, and other conditions which may endanger or materially impair the health or safety and well-being of an occupant”) and 105 C.M.R. 410.750 (requiring owners to correct violations).

15. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant to provide and maintain safe and habitable premises, including adequate ventilation and freedom from dangerous mold conditions, as required by the implied warranty of habitability and the State Sanitary Code.

16. Plaintiff routinely uses the bathroom in a normal manner, taking ordinary hot showers, and runs the exhaust fan during showers much of the time.

17. Plaintiff uses the exhaust fan in a reasonable manner for a residential tenant and does not engage in any unusual or abnormal use of the bathroom that would be expected to cause excessive mold growth.

18. After Plaintiff observed mold growth in the bathroom, she promptly notified Defendant about the problem.

19. Defendant came to the Premises, inspected the mold condition, and was therefore fully aware that mold had formed and spread across portions of the shower and ceiling.

20. Instead of acknowledging that the mold growth reflected a serious building and ventilation problem that required proper remediation, Defendant blamed Plaintiff, asserting that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and that Plaintiff’s showers were “too hot and too long.”

21. Defendant has not provided Plaintiff with any expert opinion, inspection report, or other professional determination that Plaintiff’s ordinary use of the bathroom caused the mold or relieved Defendant of responsibility under Massachusetts law.

22. Plaintiff’s use of the bathroom for regular personal hygiene is reasonable, foreseeable, and within the ordinary and intended use of the Premises.

23. Following Plaintiff’s report of the mold, Defendant stated that she would only “clean” the existing mold and expressly refused to take steps to improve the ventilation or otherwise correct the underlying moisture and mold problem.

24. Defendant has refused to modify, repair, replace, or upgrade the bathroom exhaust fan or otherwise provide adequate ventilation or building repairs to prevent the recurrence of mold.

25. Defendant’s position is that Plaintiff “caused” the mold problem and therefore Defendant has disclaimed responsibility to address the underlying cause of the mold, even though, under Massachusetts law, landlords bear responsibility for maintaining the premises in habitable condition and in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. See G.L. c. 111, § 127A; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1979).

26. Since the appearance of the mold, Plaintiff has experienced respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, conditions she did not suffer from before the mold developed.

27. Plaintiff’s doctor has advised her that the respiratory symptoms are likely related to the mold exposure and recommended that the mold be properly remediated and the underlying condition corrected.

28. Because of the mold, Plaintiff has had to discard personal property that became moldy and unusable, including a shower curtain and towels, with a replacement cost of approximately $60.

29. The ongoing mold and Defendant’s refusal to adequately address the root cause and prevent recurrence have interfered with Plaintiff’s normal use of the bathroom, causing anxiety, health concerns, and disruption in Plaintiff’s quiet and beneficial enjoyment of the Premises.

30. The mold condition is of a nature that would materially interfere with the tenancy of a reasonable person and is not a minor inconvenience or trivial discomfort.

31. Despite having actual knowledge of the mold, moisture, and ventilation problems, Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable steps to prevent the recurrence of mold or to permanently correct the Code violations.

32. Defendant’s failure to correct the mold condition and underlying causes, after being notified by Plaintiff and after personally inspecting the condition, is intentional, deliberate, and in knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s rights.

33. Defendant has made clear to Plaintiff that Defendant will not take responsibility for the ventilation or building conditions that are causing or contributing to the mold, and that Defendant intends only minimal cleaning of visible mold.

34. Defendant’s course of conduct and refusal to address the underlying issues, after notice of the health-related impact on Plaintiff, constitutes an intentional interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is guaranteed by statute, G.L. c. 186, § 14, and prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment by acts or omissions that substantially impair the character and value of the leased premises. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

36. By allowing dangerous and unsanitary mold conditions to persist, and by refusing to take reasonable corrective measures, Defendant has substantially impaired the character and value of Plaintiff’s tenancy.

37. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Premises; (b) health-related distress and respiratory symptoms; (c) property damage in the approximate amount of $60; and (d) emotional distress and inconvenience associated with living in a mold-affected bathroom that is not properly remediated.

38. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $200 in damages at this time, exclusive of statutory multiple damages, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees as allowed by G.L. c. 186, § 14 (even though Plaintiff is proceeding pro se at present).

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

39. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 38 as if fully set forth herein.

40. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

41. The covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, protects tenants from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises and is violated by conditions that create serious health and safety hazards not timely or properly corrected by the landlord after notice. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 774–75 (1994).

42. The statute applies not only to affirmative acts of harassment or self-help, but also to significant omissions and failures to act where the landlord, with notice, allows serious defective conditions and sanitary code violations to persist. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

43. The existence of unsanitary, hazardous conditions that materially impair the health or safety of the tenant, including chronic dampness and mold, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, particularly where the landlord has notice and fails to cure. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973) (recognizing habitability obligations and impact of code violations on tenant’s rights); Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–200 (1979) (landlord strictly liable for sanitary code violations affecting habitability).

44. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., adopted under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L, requires that landlords maintain residential premises free from chronic dampness, mold, and other conditions that may endanger or materially impair the health or safety of occupants. See 105 C.M.R. 410.020 and 410.750.

45. A landlord’s failure to correct State Sanitary Code violations after notice is evidence of a substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment and supports a claim under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994); Brown v. LeClair, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 977–78 (1985).

46. Defendant, as landlord, has a non-delegable duty to maintain the Premises in habitable condition and in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and may not shift responsibility to Plaintiff for basic structural, moisture, or ventilation defects. See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–201; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 199–200.

47. Defendant had actual notice of the mold condition and resulting health issues because: (a) Plaintiff specifically reported the mold; (b) Defendant personally inspected the bathroom; and (c) Plaintiff informed Defendant that the mold was affecting her health and needed to be remediated.

48. Despite this notice, Defendant has failed and refused to provide adequate repairs or remediation to eliminate the mold and correct the underlying cause, including failing to ensure adequate ventilation and moisture control.

49. Defendant’s refusal to acknowledge responsibility and to make necessary repairs is not an innocent oversight but a deliberate choice to leave the Premises in a condition that is unfit and dangerous to Plaintiff’s health and enjoyment.

50. Defendant’s acts and omissions, after notice, constitute at least “negligent or willful” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, and demonstrate a “knowing disregard” of Plaintiff’s rights. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983.

51. Defendant’s conduct and failure to abate the mold and related conditions have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home and have materially impaired the character and value of the leased premises. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. at 774–75.

52. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to: out-of-pocket expenses (approximately $60 in property loss), loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, health-related distress, and emotional and physical discomfort.

54. At Plaintiff’s monthly rent of $1,200, three months’ rent equals $3,600. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover at least three months’ rent or actual damages (including consequential damages), whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.
