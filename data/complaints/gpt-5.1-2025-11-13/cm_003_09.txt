JESSICA MARSHALL,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                    
                                                      
THOMAS REED,  
    Defendant.

Docket No.: ______________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Marshall (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Thomas Reed (“Defendant” or “Father”), and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Marshall, is an adult individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Reed, born __________, currently age 8, and is the primary physical custodian under the existing order.

2. The Defendant, Thomas Reed, is an adult individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Reed.

3. The parties are subject to the jurisdiction of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court (“this Court”) with respect to custody, parenting time, and related matters.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28, and/or G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as applicable, and the general equity jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court under G.L. c. 215, §§ 3 and 6.

5. This Court issued the existing custody and parenting-time order dated September 15, 2021, in the above‑captioned matter, and retains continuing jurisdiction to modify said order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification is in the best interests of the minor child.

6. Venue in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court is proper because the prior orders were entered in this Court and the parties and minor child reside within the Court’s jurisdiction.

### III. PRIOR ORDER

7. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2021 Custody Order”) granting the parties shared legal custody of the minor child, Ethan Reed.

8. Under the 2021 Custody Order, the child primarily resides with the Plaintiff, and the Defendant exercises parenting time with the child on specified weekends and at such other times as may be agreed upon by the parties.

9. At the time of the 2021 Custody Order, the Court found, based on the evidence then presented, that both parties were stable and capable of cooperative co‑parenting, and that the parenting schedule, including the Defendant’s weekend overnights, was in the child’s best interests.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the safety, welfare, and best interests of the minor child, such that continuation of the existing unsupervised overnight parenting-time arrangement with the Defendant is no longer in the child’s best interests.

11. The Plaintiff has learned, through the minor child and other sources, of significant concerns regarding the Defendant’s apparent consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances during his parenting time, including while the child is in his care during overnight visits.

12. The minor child, Ethan, has reported to the Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at the Defendant’s residence and that, on some occasions, the Defendant “can’t walk straight.”

13. The Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore avers, that the “special drinks” referred to by the minor child are alcoholic beverages and that the Defendant has been under the influence of alcohol and/or other substances to a degree that impairs his judgment, balance, and ability to safely care for the child during parenting time.

14. A neighbor, who is familiar with the parties’ custodial arrangement, sent the Plaintiff a video recording depicting the Defendant stumbling while removing the child from a vehicle late at night, during a time reasonably believed to be the Defendant’s court-ordered parenting time.

15. In the video, the Defendant appears visibly unsteady and impaired while handling the minor child, raising serious concerns about the Defendant’s ability to provide safe and appropriate supervision and care.

16. The Plaintiff is informed by the child’s school that Ethan routinely appears unusually tired and exhausted on Monday mornings following weekends spent with the Defendant.

17. School personnel have communicated to the Plaintiff that Ethan’s Monday fatigue appears consistent and significant enough to interfere with his attention, participation, and performance in school.

18. Upon information and belief, the child’s exhaustion is related to conditions in the Defendant’s home, including the Defendant’s suspected substance use, late‑night activity, and/or inadequate supervision or sleep routines while in the Defendant’s care.

19. The Plaintiff did not foresee these circumstances at the time of the 2021 Custody Order. The Defendant’s apparent pattern of impairment during parenting time and the resulting impact on Ethan’s safety, rest, and school functioning constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances occurring after entry of the prior order.

20. The Plaintiff has genuine and reasonable fears for the minor child’s safety and well‑being during unsupervised overnight parenting time with the Defendant, especially given the child’s young age and dependence on the Defendant for care and protection during those visits.

21. The Plaintiff’s concerns are not speculative or based on mere disagreement with the Defendant’s parenting style; rather, they are grounded in specific statements made by the child, corroborating video evidence from a third party, and consistent observations reported by school staff.

22. Continuation of the current parenting-time arrangement, which allows unsupervised overnights with the Defendant notwithstanding these concerns, presents an unreasonable risk of harm to the child and is inconsistent with the child’s best interests.

23. Since entry of the 2021 Custody Order, the Plaintiff has remained stable, continues to serve as the child’s primary caregiver, and has worked to support the child’s relationship with the Defendant, but she cannot ignore the significant safety issues that have arisen.

24. The material changes described above – namely, concerns regarding the Defendant’s apparent substance use, impairment during parenting time, and the resulting negative impact on the minor child’s safety, rest, and school functioning – warrant modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE MINOR CHILD

25. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in custody and parenting-time determinations is the “best interests of the child.” See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

26. In evaluating best interests, courts consider, among other things, the child’s safety, emotional and physical well‑being, the stability of each parent, and the effect of any proposed change in custody or parenting time. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

27. The Court is authorized to modify an existing custody or parenting-time order upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child since the entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507 (2013); Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

28. Massachusetts courts recognize that issues of parental substance abuse or impairment that affect the child’s safety or welfare can constitute such a material change in circumstances and justify modification of custody or parenting time. See Adoption of Helga, 97 Mass. App. Ct. 834 (2020); Adoption of Ilona, 459 Mass. 53 (2011); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

29. The Court has broad equitable discretion to structure parenting time, including imposing supervision or conditions, in order to protect the child’s welfare while permitting an ongoing relationship with both parents where appropriate. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844–845; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

30. Massachusetts courts have emphasized that when there is credible evidence of parental substance abuse or conduct that may endanger the child, the Court must give primacy to the child’s safety and well‑being over a parent’s interest in unrestricted access. See Adoption of Vito, 431 Mass. 550 (2000); Care & Protection of Three Minors, 392 Mass. 704 (1984).

31. The reported behavior here – the Defendant’s apparent intoxication while handling the child, the minor child’s statements about “special drinks” and the Defendant’s inability to “walk straight,” and the child’s repeated exhaustion following weekends with the Defendant – are directly relevant to the child’s safety and functioning and thus to the best‑interests analysis.

32. The Plaintiff seeks a modification that is tailored and proportional to the identified risk: limiting or conditioning the Defendant’s overnights and parenting time so as to safeguard the child while allowing the Defendant a meaningful opportunity to maintain and, if appropriate, rebuild a healthy relationship with Ethan.

33. Requiring supervised parenting time or imposing specific safety‑related conditions (such as refraining from alcohol or substance use during and prior to parenting time, and ensuring appropriate routines and rest) is consistent with the Court’s duty to fashion orders that protect the child’s physical and emotional health. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 845; Adoption of Helga, 97 Mass. App. Ct. at 844–46.

34. In light of the foregoing, the requested modification – to restrict or supervise overnights and/or impose conditions on the Defendant’s parenting time – is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child.

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

35. G.L. c. 208, § 28 provides in relevant part that the Court may “from time to time, upon a complaint after a divorce, revise and alter its judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children” as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.

36. Where the parents were never married or were not divorced in Massachusetts, the Probate and Family Court likewise has continuing authority to modify custody and parenting-time provisions under G.L. c. 209C, § 20, when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is in the child’s best interests.

37. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that a material change in circumstances is a prerequisite to modifying a custody order; once such a change is shown, the Court must consider whether the proposed modification serves the child’s best interests. Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507, 511–512 (2013); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 596.

38. The material change in circumstances requirement ensures stability while permitting the Court to respond appropriately when the factual underpinnings of the original judgment have significantly changed. See Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 682–683 (2016); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

39. Here, the circumstances on which the 2021 Custody Order was based – specifically, an assumption of both parents’ stability and ability to safely exercise unsupervised overnights – have changed materially due to the Defendant’s apparent substance use and impairment while caring for the minor child, and the documented impact on the child’s condition and school functioning.

40. In such circumstances, this Court has authority and discretion to modify the existing order by limiting, supervising, or conditioning the Defendant’s parenting time as appropriate to protect the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Adoption of Ilona, 459 Mass. at 61–64; Adoption of Helga, 97 Mass. App. Ct. at 844–46; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736–738.

41. The Plaintiff seeks only such modification as is reasonably necessary to protect Ethan’s safety and welfare, and does not seek to terminate the Defendant’s relationship with the child, but rather to ensure that such relationship proceeds in a safe, child‑focused manner.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Marshall, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the September 15, 2021 custody and parenting-time order, specifically concerning the Defendant’s apparent substance use and impairment during parenting time and the resulting impact on the minor child’s safety, rest, and school performance.

B. Find and rule that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Reed.

C. Modify the existing judgment and parenting plan to provide that:

   1. The Plaintiff shall continue as the child’s primary physical custodian;  

   2. The parties shall retain shared legal custody only to the extent that such shared decision‑making remains consistent with the child’s best interests and safety; and, to the extent necessary, the Court may award the Plaintiff sole legal custody on issues relating to the child’s health, safety, and welfare if the evidence so warrants.

D. Modify the Defendant’s parenting time such that:

   1. All overnight parenting time with the Defendant shall either:  

      a. be suspended until further order of the Court, or  

      b. be supervised by an agreed‑upon, appropriate third party or a supervised visitation center approved by the Court;  

      and such supervision shall continue unless and until the Defendant demonstrates sustained sobriety and fitness as determined by the Court.

   2. As an alternative or in addition to supervision, the Court may impose specific safety‑related conditions on any parenting time, including but not limited to:  

      a. The Defendant shall not consume alcohol or use any non‑prescribed controlled substances for at least 24 hours prior to and during any parenting time;  

      b. The Defendant shall refrain from being under the influence of alcohol or any impairing substances in the presence of the child;  

      c. The Defendant shall ensure that the child has an age‑appropriate bedtime and adequate sleep during all parenting time, particularly on nights before school;  

      d. The Defendant shall comply with any recommended evaluations or treatment related to substance use, including random alcohol or drug testing if ordered by the Court.

E. Order that exchanges of the minor child occur in a safe, neutral manner and at such times and locations as the Court deems appropriate to minimize conflict and ensure the child’s well‑being.

F. Order that the parties communicate regarding the child in a respectful, child‑focused manner, using written means (such as email or a co‑parenting application) if the Court finds that necessary to reduce conflict and protect the child from exposure to parental disputes.

G. Order any further evaluation, investigation, or services (including, but not limited to, a Guardian ad Litem investigation, substance‑abuse evaluation, or counseling) that the Court deems appropriate to assess and protect the child’s best interests.

H. Award the Plaintiff her costs associated with bringing this Complaint for Modification, as the Court deems just and proper.

I. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,
