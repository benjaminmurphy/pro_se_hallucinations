      "validation_error": null,
      "supports_proposition": true,
      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The court directly interprets G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, stating that a lessor who violates the statute is liable for either actual and consequential damages or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater, and also for costs including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. The opinion describes the three\u2011months\u2019 rent component as a minimum, multiple\u2011damage remedy where actual damages are slight or hard to prove, and later emphasizes that attorney\u2019s fees are explicitly and mandatorily authorized by \u00a7 14. This aligns with the proposition\u2019s description of the damages structure and mandatory fee provision.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that a lessor who commits any act in violation of that section (including interference \u2018with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises\u2019) shall \u2018be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u2019 \u2026 Section 14 allows a minimum recovery of three months\u2019 rent as an incentive to the pursuit of relief where the actual and consequential damages are slight or are difficult to prove.\u201d"
