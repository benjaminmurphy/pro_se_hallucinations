However, because this is a separate opinion and emphasizes a statutory\u2011standards\u2011based implied obligation rather than the broader \u201cimplied warranty of habitability\u201d label, it supports the proposition more by affirming that Massachusetts landlord\u2011tenant law (c. 186, c. 239, sanitary code, and quiet enjoyment concepts) governs such tenancies than by cleanly stating the full proposition in those exact terms.",

The focus is on implying contractual obligations from statutes and limiting rent to the fair value of deficient premises, not on defining \u2018serious interruption\u2019 or using that phrase or concept as a standard. The proposition overstates and reframes what this opinion actually decides or endorses.",
