JESSICA REYNOLDS,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                    

MARK THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff, Jessica Reynolds (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Reynolds is an individual residing at 73 Elm Street, Apartment ___, Worcester, Worcester County, Massachusetts 01605.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager/lessor of the residential property located at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 21, and G.L. c. 185C, because the claims arise from a residential tenancy in Worcester County and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court because the Premises that are the subject of this action are located in Worcester, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, § 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–5 as if fully set forth herein.

7. On or about September 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment located at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605 (the “Apartment” or “Unit”), with Defendant as landlord.

8. Plaintiff has continuously rented and occupied the Apartment as her residence since September 1, 2021, and has paid monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($1,400.00) to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times used the Apartment as her home and has complied in all material respects with her obligations as a tenant under the lease (if any), under G.L. c. 186, and under the State Sanitary Code.

10. Around three (3) months prior to the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in the kitchen area of the Apartment, including on counters, cabinets, and/or in food storage areas.

11. The presence of mouse droppings and rodent activity in the kitchen of a residential dwelling unit is a condition that renders the premises in violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to 105 C.M.R. 410.550 (rodent and insect infestation) and 105 C.M.R. 410.100 (owner’s responsibility to maintain the dwelling free from violations).

12. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the presence of mice and mouse droppings in the Apartment, including in the kitchen, and requested that Defendant remedy the infestation.

13. In response, Defendant placed a few traps in the Apartment, and a small number of mice (approximately two) were caught.

14. Notwithstanding the traps, Plaintiff continued to observe fresh mouse droppings in her kitchen on a regular basis, including on a weekly or near-weekly basis, indicating an ongoing and unresolved rodent infestation.

15. Plaintiff notified Defendant that the infestation was continuing and that the traps had not resolved the problem.

16. Defendant hired an exterminator for a single visit to the building. The exterminator treated the Premises once and, upon information and belief, indicated to Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive or repeated treatment to adequately address the rodent problem.

17. Defendant refused to authorize or pay for more extensive extermination or building-wide treatment, stating that additional work would be “overkill” and “too expensive.”

18. Defendant further stated to Plaintiff that the presence of mice was “normal for older buildings” and suggested that Plaintiff’s kitchen was not sufficiently clean, effectively blaming Plaintiff rather than undertaking adequate steps to remedy the infestation.

19. Plaintiff keeps her kitchen, and the Apartment generally, in a clean and orderly condition. Any suggestion that the rodent problem is due to Plaintiff’s failure to maintain cleanliness is incorrect and unsupported.

20. Since first noticing the droppings, Plaintiff has continued to find mouse droppings in her kitchen on a recurring basis over the course of several months.

21. As a result of the rodent infestation, Plaintiff has been forced to discard significant amounts of food that may have been contaminated or at risk of contamination by rodents, including food stored in boxes, paper, or other non-airtight containers.

22. Plaintiff estimates that she has had to throw away approximately Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) worth of food over the past few months due to the ongoing infestation and contamination concerns.

23. In an effort to protect her food from contamination, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers and similar items to store and secure her food. Plaintiff estimates that she spent approximately Eighty Dollars ($80.00) on these containers and related supplies.

24. Plaintiff has experienced ongoing anxiety, distress, and discomfort in using and enjoying her kitchen and Apartment due to the presence of rodents and rodent droppings, including fear of contamination of her food, utensils, and food-preparation surfaces.

25. The rodent infestation and the presence of droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen substantially interfere with the safe, decent, and sanitary use of the Apartment as a residence, particularly the kitchen, which is essential for the preparation and consumption of food.

26. At all relevant times, Defendant, as owner and landlord, has had the duty to maintain the Premises, including Plaintiff’s Apartment, in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and to remedy conditions that materially impair the health, safety, or well-being of occupants, including rodent infestations. See 105 C.M.R. 410.100, 410.550.

27. Despite actual notice of the rodent infestation and Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant has failed and refused to take adequate and reasonable steps to fully abate the infestation, and the condition continues.

28. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to correct the rodent problem, after notice and over an extended period of time, constitutes a failure “to do something which [he is] bound to do” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of a sanitary kitchen and Apartment; (b) property loss and expenses in the approximate amount of Two Hundred Eighty Dollars ($280.00) for contaminated food and storage containers; and (c) emotional distress, discomfort, and inconvenience associated with living in an infested dwelling and being unable to confidently use the kitchen area.

30. Defendant’s conduct was intentional, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant under Massachusetts law, including the covenant of quiet enjoyment codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION

#### COUNT I  
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

31. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises.

33. The statute provides in relevant part that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant, by the interruption of any [services] or otherwise,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and/or statutory damages.

34. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that serious and ongoing violations of the State Sanitary Code, or conditions that materially impair the health or safety of tenants, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:

   a. *Hemmings v. Mass. Port Auth.*, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 561 (1991) (quiet enjoyment protects tenant’s use of premises against serious interferences);  

   b. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable where his acts or omissions set in motion forces resulting in serious interference with tenants’ quiet enjoyment);  

   c. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s inaction in face of serious conditions and repeated complaints can breach quiet enjoyment; tenant entitled to multiple damages and emotional distress damages);  

   d. *Al Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (affirming that serious sanitary code violations and landlord’s failure to remedy can constitute breach of quiet enjoyment);  

   e. *Doyle v. Norwood Realty, Inc.*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 1004 (1988) (unremedied conditions violating the sanitary code supported quiet enjoyment judgment);  

   f. *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994) (identifying repeated code violations and landlord’s failure to address them as relevant to quiet enjoyment liability);  

   g. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (affirming quiet enjoyment judgment where landlord failed to rectify recurring code violations and unsafe conditions);  

   h. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment is violated when landlord’s acts or omissions cause substantial interference with tenant’s use of premises);  

   i. *Gomes v. Haverhill*, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 1124 (2011) (Rule 1:28 decision) (unsanitary and unsafe conditions can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment);  

   j. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (linking serious code violations, warranty of habitability, and quiet enjoyment protections).

35. The State Sanitary Code requires owners to maintain dwellings free from rodent infestation. See 105 C.M.R. 410.550 (requiring the owner to “maintain the dwelling free of rodents, skunks, and other pests” in certain circumstances); 105 C.M.R. 410.100 (owner responsible for compliance with the Code).

36. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, had a non-delegable duty to maintain the Apartment and building in compliance with the State Sanitary Code and to remedy rodent infestations that affect tenants’ health, safety, and use of the premises. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979); G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

37. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation in Plaintiff’s kitchen and Apartment, through Plaintiff’s multiple complaints and through the exterminator’s observations and statements.

38. Despite this notice, Defendant failed and refused to undertake sufficient and reasonable measures to abate the rodent infestation, instead performing only minimal and temporary measures (a few traps and a single exterminator visit) and then declining further necessary work due to cost and inconvenience.

39. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to correct the rodent infestation, and his refusal to authorize appropriate extermination despite ongoing evidence of droppings and continued infestation, constitutes an “indirect” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

40. The rodent infestation, including the presence of droppings in the kitchen area where food is stored and prepared, is a serious and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home. It has rendered the kitchen unsafe and unsanitary and has deprived Plaintiff of the full, ordinary, and lawful use of her Apartment.

41. This interference is not trivial or transient, but has persisted for months despite Plaintiff’s complaints and Defendant’s knowledge, and has resulted in ongoing health concerns, loss of food, additional expenditures, and substantial anxiety and discomfort.

42. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s failure to remedy conditions that materially impair the character and value of the leased premises for residential use, after notice and over a period of time, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Al Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994); *Doyle v. Norwood Realty, Inc.*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 1004 (1988).

43. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was intentional, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, because Defendant was repeatedly informed of the ongoing infestation and of the exterminator’s recommendation for more comprehensive treatment, yet he chose not to act adequately.

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of a safe and sanitary kitchen and Apartment;  

   b. Property loss and out-of-pocket expenses for food discarded due to contamination concerns, reasonably estimated at approximately Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00);  

   c. Out-of-pocket expenses for plastic containers and other items purchased to protect food from contamination, reasonably estimated at approximately Eighty Dollars ($80.00); and  

   d. Emotional distress, anxiety, discomfort, and inconvenience resulting from being forced to live with rodent infestation and unsanitary conditions in her home.

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for (a) actual damages or (b) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. See also *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

46. Plaintiff’s current monthly rent is approximately One Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($1,400.00). Three months’ rent therefore equals Four Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($4,200.00).

47. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover at least three months’ rent as statutory damages for Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment, or her actual damages if greater; Plaintiff reserves the right to seek the statutory amount but, for purposes of this Complaint and consistent with her present estimate of damages, requests at least the amount of Two Hundred Eighty Dollars ($280.00) in actual damages, together with any additional statutory damages, fees, and costs as the Court deems just and proper.
