COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff David Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff David Thompson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee on the premises described below.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store is a retail business entity, the exact legal form of which (corporation, limited liability company, or other) is presently unknown to Plaintiff, operating a discount home-goods store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts (the “Store”).

3. Upon information and belief, at all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, controlled, managed, and/or maintained the Store and was responsible for the safety and condition of the premises, including shelving, merchandise displays, and customer aisles.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is a civil action for negligence seeking monetary damages for personal injuries arising from an incident that occurred on or about August 15, 2023, at the Store in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Plaintiff seeks damages in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact but reasonably believed to exceed the jurisdictional minimum of the Superior Court.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County, where the Store is located and where Plaintiff’s injuries occurred.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately midday, Plaintiff lawfully entered Defendant’s Store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, as a paying customer and business invitee.

8. Plaintiff was in an aisle of the Store that displayed kitchen and home appliances, including heavy boxed appliances such as toaster ovens.

9. On information and belief, Defendant, through its employees, agents, and/or managers, had stacked multiple heavy boxes of appliances on shelving units in that aisle, approximately five or six boxes high, without adequate restraints, straps, barriers, safety rails, or other measures to prevent the boxes from falling.

10. The boxes were stacked in a manner that was unstable and unsafe, such that a foreseeable minor contact with the shelving could cause one or more boxes to fall.

11. The height at which the heavy appliance boxes were stacked created a foreseeable risk of serious injury to customers walking in the aisle beneath or adjacent to the boxes.

12. While Plaintiff was examining kitchen items in this aisle, another customer pushed a shopping cart along the same aisle in the ordinary and reasonably foreseeable manner.

13. The other customer’s cart made a normal, relatively minor contact with a lower shelf or portion of the shelving unit.

14. As a direct and immediate result of this minor contact, a large boxed toaster oven, which had been stacked high on the shelving above Plaintiff, became dislodged and fell from near the top of the stack.

15. The falling toaster-oven box struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and the side of his head.

16. Immediately upon impact, Plaintiff experienced pain in his shoulder and head, dizziness, and a severe headache.

17. Store employees and/or a manager were notified and responded to the incident.

18. The Store manager obtained information from Plaintiff, completed an incident report, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.

19. Plaintiff left the Store and later that evening his symptoms, including headache, dizziness, and shoulder pain, worsened.

20. As a result, on or about the night of August 15, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical evaluation and treatment at an emergency room in Massachusetts.

21. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.

22. Medical providers instructed Plaintiff regarding concussion care and shoulder treatment, and Plaintiff incurred medical bills for evaluation and treatment of his injuries.

23. Plaintiff’s reasonable and necessary medical expenses to date are approximately $1,200, and further expenses may be incurred for follow-up care.

24. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was employed as a delivery driver.

25. Following the incident, Plaintiff’s concussion symptoms and shoulder pain interfered with his ability to safely perform his job duties, which include driving and physical activity such as lifting and carrying.

26. As a result of his injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for several days and lost approximately $600 in wages.

27. In addition to lost wages, Plaintiff experienced limitations in his usual activities of daily living and recreational pursuits.

28. Prior to the incident, Plaintiff regularly played in a weekly soccer league.

29. Because of his concussion and shoulder injuries, Plaintiff was physically unable to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month after the incident.

30. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, physical pain, discomfort, headaches, shoulder pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life as a direct result of the incident.

31. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its employees, agents, and/or managers, owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a business invitee, to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect him from unreasonable risks of harm that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about.

32. The unsafe, over‑stacked, and unrestrained boxes of heavy appliances on high shelving constituted an unreasonably dangerous condition, particularly in a narrow aisle where customers routinely push shopping carts.

33. The risk that heavy boxes would fall from high shelves if the shelving were bumped in the normal course of shopping activity was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant.

34. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of this unsafe condition, including but not limited to:  
   a. The obvious instability and height of the stacked appliance boxes;  
   b. The absence of safety straps, rails, barriers, or other restraints;  
   c. The regular presence of customers and carts in close proximity to the shelving; and  
   d. Industry and common‑sense standards for safe merchandising practices.

35. Defendant failed to inspect, monitor, and maintain the shelving and merchandise display in a reasonably safe condition.

36. Defendant failed to properly train and supervise employees regarding safe stocking and merchandising methods, including the need for restraints or lower stacking of heavy items.

37. Defendant failed to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition created by high, unsecured stacks of heavy boxed appliances.

38. No warning signs, cones, barriers, or other safety devices were in place to alert customers of any risk or to restrict access to the hazardous area.

39. The incident would not have occurred in the absence of negligence in the stacking, securing, and maintenance of the boxes of appliances.

40. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the accident and was acting as a reasonable person would act under the circumstances.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE

41. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land who invites members of the public onto its premises for business purposes owes invitees a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood and seriousness of injury and the burden of avoiding the risk. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973); see also *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995).

43. Defendant, as owner/operator and person in control of the Store, owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to:  
   a. Use reasonable care in the operation, maintenance, and inspection of the Store premises;  
   b. Remedy or guard against dangerous conditions it knew or reasonably should have known existed; and  
   c. Warn Plaintiff of hidden or non‑obvious dangers of which Defendant knew or should have known. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 785–86 (2007); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 373–74 (2010).

44. Retail store owners have a duty to protect customers from foreseeable injuries caused by the manner in which merchandise is displayed or stacked. See, e.g., *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 786–87 (recognizing duty of store to protect invitees from reasonably foreseeable dangers on the premises); *Hubbard v. Palmer Russell Co.*, 343 Mass. 414, 416–17 (1961) (storekeeper liable for injuries when fixtures or displays are maintained in unsafe condition); *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 165–66 (1980) (duty of reasonable care extends to all lawful visitors).

45. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Stacking heavy boxes of appliances to a height of five or six boxes on open shelving in a customer aisle;  
   b. Failing to secure the stacked boxes with straps, restraints, rails, barriers, or other safety devices;  
   c. Failing to adopt or follow reasonable store policies and procedures for safe stacking and display of heavy merchandise;  
   d. Failing to inspect the shelving and merchandise displays at reasonable intervals to identify and correct unsafe conditions;  
   e. Failing to train and supervise employees regarding safe stocking practices and the foreseeable risk of falling merchandise;  
   f. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the risk of falling boxes in the aisle; and  
   g. Otherwise failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation and maintenance of the Store premises.

46. Defendant either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that stacking heavy boxes of appliances high on shelves without restraints in an aisle regularly used by customers and shopping carts created an unreasonable risk that boxes could fall and injure customers.

47. The danger presented by high, unsecured stacks of heavy boxes was either known to Defendant or was so obvious that Defendant should have known of it upon reasonable inspection. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 431 Mass. 376, 379–80 (2000) (duty to discover and remedy dangers that reasonable inspection would reveal); *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961) (storekeeper must use reasonable care to keep premises safe for customers).

48. The falling toaster‑oven box and resulting injuries to Plaintiff were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to safely stack and secure heavy merchandise in the customer aisle. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006) (foreseeability is key component of duty and scope of risk); *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996).

49. Defendant’s negligence need not be the sole cause of Plaintiff’s injuries; it is sufficient that Defendant’s breach of duty was a substantial contributing cause of the injuries. See *Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 431, adopted in part in *O’Connor v. Raymark Indus., Inc.*, 401 Mass. 586, 590 (1988).

50. The involvement of another customer who made a normal and foreseeable contact with the shelving while pushing a cart does not relieve Defendant of liability, because Defendant was required to anticipate ordinary customer conduct and to guard against the resulting risks. See *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 319–20 (2002) (duty includes taking account of reasonably foreseeable acts of third persons); *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 53–54 (1983) (duty may include obligation to protect against reasonably foreseeable actions of third parties).

51. To the extent any dangerous condition was created by Defendant or its employees (through its stocking and display practices), Plaintiff is not required to prove that Defendant had separate “notice” of that specific hazard. See *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955) (where defendant or its employees create the hazard, notice is inferred); *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 786–87.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following harms and damages:

   a. A mild concussion, with associated headaches, dizziness, and cognitive and physical symptoms;  
   b. A shoulder strain, accompanied by pain, reduced range of motion, and physical limitations;  
   c. Medical expenses to date of approximately $1,200, and potential future medical and related expenses;  
   d. Lost wages of approximately $600 due to time missed from work as a delivery driver;  
   e. Pain and suffering, both physical and emotional;  
   f. Loss of enjoyment of life, including but not limited to Plaintiff’s inability to participate in his weekly soccer league for about one month and limitations on other normal activities; and  
   g. Other general and special damages to be proven at trial.

53. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under the common law of Massachusetts and is actionable pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, which preserves comparative negligence principles but does not bar recovery where Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than the negligence of Defendant.

54. Plaintiff denies any negligence on his part. However, to the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff states that any such negligence is less than Defendant’s negligence and that Plaintiff’s recovery should be diminished, if at all, only in accordance with G.L. c. 231, § 85. See *Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 62–63 (1988).

55. Plaintiff is entitled to recover prejudgment interest on his damages as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B and costs as permitted by law.
