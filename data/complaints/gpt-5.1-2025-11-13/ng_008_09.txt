**SARAH THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**QUINCY BISTRO, INC.** d/b/a **QUINCY BISTRO**,  
Defendant.  

____________________________________/

**COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE**


Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Quincy Bistro, Inc. d/b/a Quincy Bistro (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Thompson”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Bistro, Inc. is a Massachusetts business corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts 02169, and at all times relevant operated a restaurant to the public under the trade name “Quincy Bistro” (collectively, “Quincy Bistro” or “Defendant”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained the premises located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169 (the “Premises”), including the dining room, kitchen, hallways, and restrooms.

4. At all relevant times, Defendant, by and through its agents, servants, and employees, was acting within the course and scope of its business as a restaurant and within the course and scope of their employment.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising out of Defendant’s negligence under the common law of Massachusetts.

6. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is sufficient to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Superior Court. See G.L. c. 212, § 3.

7. The incident that is the subject of this action occurred in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, at the Premises located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, MA 02169.

8. Venue is proper in the Norfolk County Superior Court, Quincy Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and/or 9, because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County and Defendant conducts business in Norfolk County.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

9. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately 7:00–8:00 p.m., Plaintiff was lawfully on the Premises as a paying customer and business invitee of Quincy Bistro.

10. Plaintiff was seated in the dining area of Quincy Bistro, located adjacent to a narrow hallway that connects the dining room with the kitchen and restroom area.

11. While Plaintiff was dining, a server employed by Defendant walked through the narrow hallway carrying a tray containing several water glasses.

12. The server dropped the tray, causing multiple glasses to fall and break in the hallway, spilling water and ice across the tile floor and creating a slippery condition (the “Water Hazard”).

13. Immediately after the spill, the server and/or other staff members quickly picked up the broken glass but did not remove or adequately dry the water and ice remaining on the floor.

14. The server stated, in substance, that she would “be right back with a mop,” acknowledging the existence of the spill and the need to clean it.

15. Despite this acknowledgment, no “Wet Floor,” “Caution,” or other warning signs, cones, or barriers were placed in or near the hallway to warn customers or staff about the Water Hazard.

16. The hallway between the dining room and restroom area was narrow, frequently used by customers and staff, and not reasonably avoidable by a customer seeking to use the restroom.

17. Approximately ten (10) minutes after the spill occurred, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom.

18. Plaintiff proceeded toward the restroom through the same narrow hallway where the spill had occurred.

19. At that time, the Water Hazard had not been mopped up or otherwise corrected and remained on the tile floor in the hallway.

20. The water on the tile floor reflected the overhead lights and, from Plaintiff’s vantage point, reasonably appeared like normal shiny tile until she was already stepping on it.

21. Plaintiff did not receive any warning from Defendant’s employees or agents about the Water Hazard before entering the hallway.

22. There were no warning cones, signs, or other visual or physical barriers in or around the hallway to alert Plaintiff to the Water Hazard.

23. As Plaintiff stepped into the hallway, she unknowingly stepped onto the wet, slippery surface caused by the spilled water and ice.

24. The wet condition of the floor caused Plaintiff’s foot to slide out from under her, and she slipped and fell, violently twisting her knee (the “Incident”).

25. Plaintiff immediately experienced sharp pain in her knee, difficulty bearing weight, and significant discomfort.

26. After the fall, Plaintiff remained on the floor in pain, and staff members of Defendant came to assist her.

27. After the Incident, Plaintiff overheard employees of Defendant stating, in substance, that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while.

28. The employees’ statements indicate that Defendant’s staff knew of the existence of the Water Hazard before Plaintiff’s fall and had recognized it as a condition to be avoided.

29. Despite that knowledge, Defendant’s employees did not timely clean the Water Hazard, cordon off the area, or provide adequate warning to customers, including Plaintiff.

30. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a sprained knee.

31. Plaintiff sought immediate medical evaluation and treatment at an urgent care facility.

32. At urgent care, Plaintiff was examined, diagnosed with a sprained knee, and prescribed conservative treatment, including rest, use of a knee brace, and pain management.

33. Due to persistent pain and limited mobility, Plaintiff underwent a course of physical therapy over the ensuing weeks.

34. Plaintiff was required to wear a knee brace and to limit her activities, including her ability to walk, stand, and perform normal daily tasks.

35. As a result of the Incident, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in an amount presently estimated to be approximately $2,000, including but not limited to urgent care visits, diagnostic services, follow-up care, and physical therapy.

36. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,500 in wages due to missed work and reduced hours attributable to her injury and treatment.

37. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain, discomfort, and/or limitations in her knee, as well as inconvenience and loss of enjoyment of life.

38. The Water Hazard in the hallway was a dangerous condition that posed an unreasonable risk of harm to customers lawfully using the hallway, including Plaintiff.

39. The hallway was under the exclusive control of Defendant.

40. Defendant, through its employees, created and/or allowed the Water Hazard to persist in the hallway.

41. Defendant and its employees had actual knowledge of the Water Hazard, as evidenced by the server’s acknowledgment of needing a mop and employees’ later statements about “dodging that puddle.”

42. Alternatively, Defendant had constructive knowledge of the Water Hazard because it existed for a sufficient period of time—at least several minutes—such that it should have been discovered and remedied by the exercise of reasonable care.

43. Defendant failed to establish and/or follow appropriate safety procedures and policies to ensure that spills were promptly cleaned up and that adequate warnings were given to customers.

44. Defendant failed to properly train and supervise its employees regarding the immediate cleanup of spills and the placement of warning devices when a spill could not be promptly and fully remedied.

45. Defendant failed to inspect and maintain the hallway in a reasonably safe condition for customers.

46. The dangerous condition was not open and obvious to Plaintiff until it was too late to avoid slipping, given the lighting, the nature of the tile, and the reflection of the water.

47. Even if aspects of the condition were arguable as “open and obvious,” Defendant still had a duty to remedy or mitigate the danger where it could foresee that patrons, such as Plaintiff, would reasonably use the hallway to reach the restroom and might be distracted or unable to fully appreciate the risk.

48. Plaintiff acted reasonably and with due care for her own safety at all times material hereto.

49. Plaintiff neither knew nor had reason to know of the Water Hazard prior to stepping into the hallway.

50. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions, rather than by any negligence on Plaintiff’s part.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence (Premises Liability)**

51. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–50 above as if fully set forth herein.

52. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was lawfully upon Defendant’s Premises as a paying customer and business invitee.

53. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful visitor and business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances. *See* G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (abolishing common-law distinctions between invitees and licensees and holding that landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors).

54. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to take reasonable steps to protect her from foreseeable risks of harm, including dangerous conditions such as slippery, wet floors in common passageways and hallways used by customers. *See* *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154–56 (2013) (duty to act reasonably in light of foreseeable risks); *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 376–78 (2010) (property owner’s duty to remedy unsafe conditions on its property).

55. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to inspect areas open to the public, including the hallway between the dining room and restroom, and to remedy or warn of dangerous conditions that Defendant knew or reasonably should have known existed. *See* *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973) (duty to maintain premises in reasonably safe condition and warn of dangers of which owner knows or should know); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermkts., Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783–85 (2007) (owner liable for injuries caused by unsafe conditions if it created condition or had actual/constructive notice).

56. Defendant, acting by and through its agents and employees, breached its duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

   a. Creating, causing, or allowing the Water Hazard to remain on the floor of the hallway used by customers;

   b. Failing to promptly and adequately clean up the spilled water and ice after the server dropped the tray of glasses;

   c. Failing to place or maintain any warning signs, cones, barriers, or other devices to alert customers, including Plaintiff, to the presence of the Water Hazard;

   d. Failing to warn Plaintiff verbally about the Water Hazard despite knowing that patrons would need to use the hallway to access the restroom;

   e. Failing to inspect, monitor, and maintain the hallway in a reasonably safe condition;

   f. Failing to implement or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the immediate cleanup of spills and placement of appropriate warnings;

   g. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees regarding the duty to keep walking surfaces free of hazardous conditions and to warn customers when hazards exist;

   h. Permitting the Water Hazard to exist for an unreasonable period of time before Plaintiff’s fall, even though Defendant had actual and/or constructive knowledge of the condition;

   i. Failing to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable injury to customers, including Plaintiff, from slipping on the Water Hazard.

57. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner may be found negligent when it (1) created the dangerous condition; (2) had actual knowledge of the condition; or (3) had constructive knowledge because the condition existed for such a length of time that in the exercise of reasonable care it should have been discovered and remedied. *See* *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermkts., Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–85 (2007).

58. Defendant, through its employees, directly created the Water Hazard when the server spilled water and ice in the hallway and failed to adequately clean it up, satisfying the “mode of operation” and creation prongs recognized in *Sheehan*.

59. Defendant had actual knowledge of the Water Hazard, as evidenced by: (a) the server’s statement that she would return with a mop, acknowledging the spill and the need for cleanup; and (b) employees’ statements after the Incident that they had been “dodging that puddle,” showing they were aware of and consciously avoiding the hazard.

60. Independently, Defendant had constructive knowledge of the Water Hazard because it existed for at least several minutes—long enough that reasonable inspection and maintenance practices would have detected and corrected the condition prior to Plaintiff’s fall. *See* *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955) (constructive notice where condition existed long enough to be discovered with reasonable care).

61. The Water Hazard was in a location—an interior hallway between the dining room and restroom—where Defendant could reasonably foresee that patrons would walk frequently, including wearing footwear that provides limited traction on wet tile.

62. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to remove or warn of the Water Hazard violated the duty of reasonable care as articulated in Massachusetts premises liability law. *See* *Mounsey*, 363 Mass. at 707; *Papadopoulos*, 457 Mass. at 376–78.

63. The danger posed by a wet, slippery tile floor in a narrow hallway used by customers was reasonably foreseeable, and Defendant’s failure to act in response to that danger was unreasonable. *See* *Dos Santos*, 465 Mass. at 154–56 (foreseeability of harm informs scope of duty).

64. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries were the direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to exercise reasonable care.

65. To the extent Defendant contends that the Water Hazard was open and obvious, such contention does not eliminate Defendant’s duty where, as here, it was foreseeable that an invitee would encounter the condition in order to use necessary facilities (the restroom), and reasonable steps could have been taken to remedy or mitigate the danger. *See* *Soederberg v. Concord Greene Condo. Ass’n*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 336–38 (2010) (even with open and obvious conditions, landowner may owe duty to remedy where it is foreseeable that lawful visitors will proceed despite the danger).

66. Moreover, the Water Hazard was not, in fact, open and obvious to Plaintiff until she was already stepping into the hallway, given the shiny appearance of the tile, the lighting, and lack of any distinguishing visual cues.

67. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, Plaintiff’s recovery shall not be barred by any alleged contributory negligence unless it is found to be greater than that of Defendant, and any such negligence on Plaintiff’s part—if found—would only proportionately diminish, not bar, her recovery.

68. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor and the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall, injuries, and damages.

69. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained, and will continue to sustain, the following injuries and damages:

   a. Physical injuries, including but not limited to a sprained knee, pain, and reduced range of motion;

   b. Medical expenses in an amount presently estimated at approximately $2,000, and such additional medical expenses as may be incurred in the future for further treatment, evaluation, or rehabilitation;

   c. Lost wages and loss of earning capacity, presently estimated at approximately $1,500 in past lost earnings and such additional loss of earnings as may be proven at trial;

   d. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, mental anguish, emotional distress, and inconvenience;

   e. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal activities of daily living;

   f. Any scarring, residual impairment, or ongoing limitations associated with her injury.

70. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for her injuries and damages in accordance with Massachusetts law. *See, e.g.*, *Graci v. Damon*, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 167 (1978) (damages in negligence actions include pain and suffering, medical expenses, and impairment of earning capacity).

71. Plaintiff also seeks statutory interest from the date of commencement of this action, as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B (prejudgment interest on personal injury judgments) and costs as allowed by law.
