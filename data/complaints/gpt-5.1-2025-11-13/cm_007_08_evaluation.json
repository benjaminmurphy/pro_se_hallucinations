It does not discuss standards for modifying prior custody or visitation orders, nor does it articulate any rule that a court need not wait for actual harm and may act on a substantial risk of harm. The claimed Massachusetts law principle about modification based on substantial risk does not appear in this decision\u2019s holding or reasoning.",

L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, proceeding, a judge must find by clear and convincing evidence that a parent is presently unfit to provide for the welfare and best interests of the child in order to grant the petition\u2026 After reviewing the evidence and testimony properly before the judge, we conclude that the judge\u2019s conclusions were supported by clear and convincing evidence and were not clearly erroneous.\u201d"
