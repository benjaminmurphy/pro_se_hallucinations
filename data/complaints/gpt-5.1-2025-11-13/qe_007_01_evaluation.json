The court then applies this standard to the landlord\u2019s omissions regarding security and drug activity, confirming that the correct test focuses on whether the landlord\u2019s conduct or failure to act naturally and probably results in substantial interference with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the premises.",
