DOCKET NO. __________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
------------------------------------------------------  


Plaintiff Carla Martinez (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant James Sullivan (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Carla Martinez is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Studio Apartment, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

2. Defendant James Sullivan is an individual and the owner and/or manager of the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Premises”), where Plaintiff resides as a tenant.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises out of Defendant’s breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s residential tenancy pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional threshold of this Court.

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is an action concerning residential housing, a landlord-tenant relationship, and claims related to the use and occupancy of a residential dwelling.

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department under G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3, 6 because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, within this Division, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred there.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a studio apartment at 123 Maple Street, Studio Apartment, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”), owned and controlled by Defendant.

8. Plaintiff agreed to pay, and has paid, monthly rent in the amount of $1,500.00 to Defendant for her tenancy.

9. Prior to signing the lease and moving into the Apartment, Plaintiff viewed the Premises with Defendant.

10. During that pre‑tenancy showing, Plaintiff observed visible water stains on the ceiling of the Apartment.

11. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the stains and whether there had been water leaks.

12. Defendant affirmatively represented to Plaintiff that there had been an “old leak” but that it had been “totally fixed.”

13. Defendant’s statements were material to Plaintiff’s decision to rent the Apartment, as she was concerned about water damage and potential leaking.

14. Relying on Defendant’s representation that the leak had been fully repaired and that the issue had been resolved, Plaintiff decided to enter into the tenancy and move into the Apartment.

15. Within approximately the first few months of Plaintiff’s tenancy, during the first significant rainstorm after she moved in, water began leaking through the ceiling of the Apartment in the same area where the prior water stains were located.

16. The leak was not minor or merely cosmetic; water actively dripped through the ceiling onto the living area of the Apartment.

17. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak and requested repair.

18. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant minimized the problem and referred to it as a “minor cosmetic issue,” and told Plaintiff that she knew the apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.

19. The leak recurred during subsequent rainstorms and became progressively worse over the course of Plaintiff’s tenancy.

20. During at least one heavy rainstorm, the leak became so severe that water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and a laptop that had been left on her coffee table was damaged beyond repair.

21. As a direct result of the leak, Plaintiff’s laptop was destroyed, and Plaintiff was required to replace it at an approximate cost of $900.00.

22. On multiple occasions, Plaintiff complained to Defendant about the continuing leaks, the damage to her personal property, and the conditions in the Apartment.

23. Defendant failed and/or refused to take timely and adequate steps to correct the leak, to properly diagnose and repair the roof or other building components causing the leak, or to remediate the resulting moisture and damage in the Apartment.

24. Over time, the recurring water intrusion caused a persistent musty odor in the Apartment, consistent with dampness and possible mold growth.

25. Subsequent to the onset of the musty odor and ongoing dampness, Plaintiff began to suffer from frequent headaches, which she reasonably believes may be related to mold or other moisture‑related environmental conditions in the Apartment.

26. The leak, associated dampness, and musty odor rendered a substantial portion of the Apartment unhealthy and unpleasant to use.

27. To avoid sleeping or sitting under the area of the ceiling that leaked, Plaintiff was forced to move her bed away from the affected area and effectively abandon use of a significant portion of the Apartment.

28. As a result, Plaintiff has effectively been living in only half of the living space she is paying rent to occupy.

29. The conditions described above substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a habitable studio apartment.

30. At all relevant times, Defendant had notice or constructive notice of the leak condition, having been aware of prior water damage (as evidenced by the stains) before Plaintiff moved in, and by Plaintiff’s repeated complaints thereafter.

31. Despite repeated notice and complaints, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to permanently remedy the defective condition causing the leak, to properly repair the ceiling, and to remediate any resulting mold or related environmental hazards.

32. Defendant’s failure to repair and his repeated dismissive responses were intentional, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a residential tenant.

33. The recurring water intrusion and resulting conditions are not merely aesthetic; they implicate basic habitability, health, and safety, and are violations of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to provisions requiring the owner to maintain the structure and building elements in good repair and free from chronic dampness and mold.

34. Defendant’s conduct and omissions have caused Plaintiff substantial interference with her quiet enjoyment of the Apartment, emotional distress, discomfort, inconvenience, and property damage.

35. Plaintiff has at all times been ready, willing, and able to comply with her obligations under the tenancy, including payment of rent.

36. Plaintiff has, in fact, continued to pay rent despite the diminished value and use of the Apartment caused by Defendant’s failure to correct the leaks and associated conditions.

37. Defendant, as landlord, is responsible for ensuring that the Premises are maintained in a condition that does not unreasonably interfere with Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy her home.

38. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14, protects tenants from substantial interference with their tenancy caused by their landlord’s acts or omissions.

39. The pervasive and ongoing water leak, damage to Plaintiff’s property, musty odor, and unhealthy living conditions constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and controlling case law.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, including but not limited to: (a) loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Apartment; (b) damage to personal property (including her laptop and furniture); (c) diminution in the value of the tenancy relative to the rent paid; and (d) discomfort, inconvenience, and health‑related concerns.

41. Plaintiff reasonably estimates her current damages arising from Defendant’s breach of quiet enjoyment to be at least $1,000.00, exclusive of statutory multiple damages, interest, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees to the extent recoverable by statute.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

42. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 41 as if fully set forth herein.

43. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

44. Under Massachusetts law, this statutory covenant is construed broadly to protect tenants from substantial interference with their tenancy caused by the landlord’s acts or neglect. See, e.g., *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

45. A landlord’s failure to remedy serious or recurring defective conditions within the landlord’s control, after notice, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman*, 417 Mass. 771, 774–75 (1994).

46. Leaks, chronic dampness, and related unsanitary or unhealthy conditions have been held to interfere substantially with a tenant’s use of the premises and to support claims for breach of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment protects tenant from serious interference within landlord’s control); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (upholding tenant recovery for interference with quiet enjoyment due to landlord’s failure to correct code violations).

47. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., imposes specific obligations on owners to maintain residential premises in a safe, sanitary, and habitable condition, including requirements that the roof, walls, ceilings, and structural elements be kept in good repair and free from leaks and chronic dampness. Violations of these regulations may constitute evidence of a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 201–02 (1979).

48. At all relevant times, Defendant had a non‑delegable duty to maintain the roof, structure, and building systems serving the Apartment in a condition that would not result in recurrent water intrusion or unsanitary conditions. See G.L. c. 111, § 127A; 105 C.M.R. 410.000; *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 194–98 (1973).

49. Defendant knew or should have known of the defective roof or building condition causing the leak before Plaintiff’s tenancy began, as evidenced by the pre‑existing water stains Plaintiff observed and specifically inquired about during the showing.

50. Defendant affirmatively represented to Plaintiff that the “old leak” was “totally fixed,” despite, on information and belief, the absence of a permanent repair and the ongoing risk of renewed leakage.

51. After the tenancy commenced, and after the first and subsequent significant rainstorms, Plaintiff notified Defendant that water was leaking through the ceiling and requested repair on multiple occasions.

52. Defendant repeatedly minimized the problem, calling it a “minor cosmetic issue” and asserting that Plaintiff accepted the apartment’s “character,” and failed to promptly and adequately investigate, repair, or remediate the leak and any resulting damage.

53. Defendant’s failure to correct the leaking ceiling, water intrusion, and resulting unsanitary conditions, despite repeated notice, constitutes a willful, knowing, or at minimum reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment.

54. The ongoing leak, dampness, musty odor, and associated health concerns deprived Plaintiff of the use of a substantial portion of the Apartment, compelling her to live effectively in only half of the space she is paying for.

55. The same conditions damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including her couch and a laptop that had a replacement cost of approximately $900.00, and caused Plaintiff distress, discomfort, and disruption to her daily life.

56. Under *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), a landlord’s liability for breach of quiet enjoyment extends to interferences that are a natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s actions or omissions and within the landlord’s control. Here, the recurring leak and related damage were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to address known building defects.

57. In *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), the Supreme Judicial Court recognized that severe and recurring interference with a tenant’s enjoyment of her home, especially involving water infiltration and flooding, supports a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment and can warrant multiple damages and compensation for the tenant’s resulting harm.

58. In *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), the Court held that proof of a willful or knowing interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 entitles the tenant to actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and that landlord neglect of serious conditions after notice can constitute such interference.

59. Defendant’s conduct likewise constitutes a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, because Defendant failed to act reasonably to correct conditions that he knew, or had reason to know, were substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises. See also *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994) (upholding liability where landlord’s neglect caused serious interference with tenancy); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987) (recognizing tenant’s right to recover for substantial and chronic code violations under quiet enjoyment statute).

60. The conditions at issue here—recurring leak, property damage, musty odor, and resulting health concerns—are not trivial, isolated, or de minimis, but rather constitute a pattern of serious interference over an extended period of Plaintiff’s tenancy.

61. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to: (a) diminution in the value of the Apartment and loss of use of a substantial portion of the space; (b) the cost to replace her laptop and other damaged personal property; and (c) the discomfort, inconvenience, and distress associated with living in an unhealthy, water‑damaged environment.

62. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. at 200–02; *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman*, 417 Mass. at 774–75.

63. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was willful, knowing, and/or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, such that an award of at least three months’ rent as statutory damages is warranted under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action and, to the extent permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14, reasonable attorney’s fees, together with interest as allowed by law pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;
