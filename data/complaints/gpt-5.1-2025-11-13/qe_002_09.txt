COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Harris (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Linda Smith (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Harris is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Linda Smith is an individual who owns and/or controls, directly or indirectly, the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”), and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 111.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

4. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional amount of this Court.

5. Jurisdiction is proper in the Massachusetts Housing Court, Boston Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3, because this action concerns a residential rental premises located in Boston/Roxbury and involves a dispute between a landlord and tenant regarding rights and obligations under Massachusetts landlord–tenant law.

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises is located in Roxbury, Suffolk County, within this Division’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a basement apartment at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”), owned and/or managed by Defendant.

8. Plaintiff has at all relevant times used the Premises as Plaintiff’s primary residence.

9. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

10. Other than a brief, approximately two‑week delay in October 2025 due to unexpected medical bills, Plaintiff has generally paid rent as required. For October 2025, Plaintiff paid the rent in full, including any late fee demanded by Defendant.

11. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff observed water seeping through a basement wall of the Premises whenever it rained heavily.

12. The water intrusion was substantial enough to saturate carpet/rug materials and to travel along the base of the wall, creating visible dampness, pooling, and an ongoing moisture problem.

13. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant by text message in or about November 2025 of the water intrusion and dampness, and requested that Defendant remedy the condition.

14. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but did not arrange for timely, adequate repairs and did not stop the water infiltration.

15. Over the following weeks, the water intrusion continued during heavy rains, causing damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including but not limited to a rug and a bookshelf positioned against the affected wall.

16. Plaintiff estimates that the damaged personal property has a replacement value of approximately $400.

17. In addition, because of the ongoing dampness and moisture, Plaintiff was forced to run a dehumidifier on a near‑constant basis to attempt to control humidity and prevent mold or further damage.

18. Running the dehumidifier substantially increased Plaintiff’s electric bill beyond normal usage; these increased utility costs were a direct result of the water intrusion and Defendant’s failure to repair.

19. After several weeks with no effective corrective action by Defendant, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston (or appropriate municipal inspection authorities) to complain about the conditions in the Premises.

20. Municipal inspection personnel came to the Premises, inspected the Apartment, and identified the water intrusion problem as well as additional code‑related issues, resulting in the issuance of housing or sanitary code violations and/or orders to correct pursuant to the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.

21. Despite being put on notice by Plaintiff and by municipal inspectors of serious defects, including water infiltration into a basement unit and code violations, Defendant failed and continues to fail to correct the water problem and associated code issues.

22. The continuing water intrusion and moisture create unhealthy, unsanitary, and unsafe living conditions, in violation of the State Sanitary Code and rendering the Premises unfit for human habitation.

23. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises has been significantly and materially interfered with by the persistent water intrusion, dampness, damaged property, and increased utility costs, as well as by the stress and anxiety associated with the unsafe and unsanitary conditions.

24. Following Plaintiff’s complaint to the City and the resulting inspection, Defendant began referring to Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

25. Defendant has stated that she does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 (or March 2025 if the current lease term is differently dated), and attributes this decision, at least ostensibly, to Plaintiff’s brief late payment of rent in October 2025.

26. The timing of Defendant’s threats not to renew the lease, coming closely on the heels of Plaintiff’s contacting the City and the municipal inspection and citations, suggests that Defendant’s actions are, at least in part, retaliatory and in response to Plaintiff’s lawful exercise of his rights to seek code enforcement and habitable housing conditions.

27. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has acted reasonably in response to the conditions and in communicating with Defendant and with municipal authorities.

28. At all relevant times, Defendant, as landlord, has had actual or constructive notice of the water intrusion and code violations and has had the duty and ability to correct them.

29. Despite such notice and duty, Defendant has unreasonably failed and refused to remedy the water intrusion and related unsanitary and unsafe conditions.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to: (a) loss and damage to personal property; (b) increased utility costs; (c) loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; (d) emotional distress, discomfort, and inconvenience; and (e) diminution in the value of the tenancy.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

31. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment” of a residential tenant’s premises and imposes liability when a landlord, or anyone acting on the landlord’s behalf, “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises” or fails to provide services or make repairs required by law.

33. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease in Massachusetts, and a breach may arise not only from overt harassment or physical intrusion, but also from a landlord’s failure to correct serious defects and code violations that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises.

   - See, e.g., **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable under covenant of quiet enjoyment for substantial interference with tenant’s use and enjoyment, even without intent, where landlord’s actions set in motion the cause of the interference);  
   - **Hemingway v. Chief of Police of Milton**, 368 Mass. 438, 443–49 (1975) (recognizing broad remedial purposes of tenant protective statutes).

34. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that serious and ongoing violations of the State Sanitary Code, and conditions that render an apartment unsafe, unsanitary, or unfit for human habitation, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

   - **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (serious code violations can support quiet enjoyment claim; landlord’s failure to maintain habitable premises may constitute indirect interference);  
   - **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman**, 417 Mass. 771, 774–75 (1994) (finding substantial interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment where landlord allowed serious conditions to persist);  
   - **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982) (unsanitary conditions and water problems may breach quiet enjoyment).

35. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., requires landlords to maintain the structural integrity of the building, protect against water and moisture penetration, and provide safe and sanitary conditions. See **G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L**.

36. Under G.L. c. 111, § 127A, the Department of Public Health is authorized to promulgate regulations (the State Sanitary Code) establishing minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, including control of moisture and prevention of dampness that may endanger health or safety.

37. Under G.L. c. 111, § 127L, a tenant may complain to the board of health or other local authority regarding violations of the State Sanitary Code, and such complaints are protected activity; landlords may not lawfully penalize or retaliate against tenants for pursuing code enforcement.

38. In **Crowell v. McCaffrey**, 377 Mass. 443, 451–52 (1979), the Supreme Judicial Court held that repeated housing code violations and deficiencies that materially affect the habitability of a dwelling constitute a breach of the implied warranty of habitability and may also support recovery under the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

39. In **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s failure to deal adequately with flooding and water problems in an apartment, resulting in repeated flooding and damage, constituted a substantial interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling the tenant to damages and attorneys’ fees.

40. Defendant’s failure to repair and stop the repeated water intrusion into Plaintiff’s basement Apartment, after being notified by Plaintiff and by municipal inspectors, constitutes a failure to provide services and make repairs required by law and an indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

41. The water intrusion and persistent dampness are substantial, ongoing conditions that materially impair Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, similar to the conditions found to violate G.L. c. 186, § 14 in **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 102–05.

42. Massachusetts appellate courts have also held that a landlord’s pattern of inaction and neglect in remedying serious defects can amount to a breach of quiet enjoyment even without explicit harassment:

   - **Winchester v. O’Brien**, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929) (covenant of quiet enjoyment breached where landlord allowed conditions that substantially interfered with tenant’s beneficial use);  
   - **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273, 283–84 (1994) (tenant may recover compensatory damages for interference with quiet enjoyment from unsafe or uninhabitable conditions).

43. Here, Defendant’s actions and omissions have caused pervasive dampness and unremedied water damage in Plaintiff’s basement Apartment, an inherently vulnerable location for moisture problems, resulting in unsanitary and unsafe conditions in violation of the State Sanitary Code.

44. The conditions at the Premises, including the water infiltration and unsanitary conditions, constitute violations of the State Sanitary Code that materially impair the health, safety, and comfort of Plaintiff as a tenant.

45. Defendant’s failure to promptly and effectively correct these conditions after receiving notice from Plaintiff and from the City constitutes an unreasonable failure to provide services and repairs required by law, and therefore an “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

46. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. See **Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman**, 417 Mass. at 775–76 (statute mandates at least three months’ rent or actual damages, plus attorney’s fees).

47. In **Damiano v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co.**, 316 Mass. 626, 629–30 (1944), the court recognized that damages for breach of quiet enjoyment may include compensation for loss of use, discomfort, and related consequential damages caused by the landlord’s breach.

48. Defendant’s statements characterizing Plaintiff as a “problem tenant” and her announced intention not to renew Plaintiff’s lease following Plaintiff’s complaint to city inspectors further reflect interference with Plaintiff’s secure and peaceful possession, and are consistent with retaliatory conduct prohibited under G.L. c. 186, §§ 14 and 18.

   - See **G.L. c. 186, § 18** (establishing a presumption of retaliation when a landlord acts adversely against a tenant within six months after the tenant seeks code enforcement or exercises housing rights);  
   - See also **Beal v. Boston Hous. Auth.**, 423 Mass. 831, 834–36 (1996) (discussing protections against retaliation and the importance of safeguarding tenants who assert their rights).

49. Plaintiff’s brief late payment of October 2025 rent, which was subsequently paid in full along with any late fee, does not excuse Defendant’s statutory obligations to maintain the premises and to refrain from interfering with quiet enjoyment. Massachusetts law makes clear that a tenant’s obligation to pay rent and a landlord’s obligation to maintain habitable and code‑compliant conditions are mutually dependent, and that code violations and habitability defects may justify rent abatement and other relief.

   - See **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196, 200–02 (1979) (recognizing interdependence of lease covenants and allowing rent abatement where sanitary code violations exist);  
   - **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway**, 363 Mass. 184, 194–200 (1973) (establishing implied warranty of habitability and tenant remedies for code violations).

50. Defendant’s actions and omissions described herein constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy and expressly protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14.

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Damage to personal property (approximately $400 for rug and bookshelf);  
   b. Increased electric bills due to constant operation of a dehumidifier;  
   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises due to ongoing water intrusion and unsanitary conditions;  
   d. Discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional distress associated with unsafe and unsanitary living conditions and uncertainty regarding the tenancy.

52. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the greater of three months’ rent or actual damages, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. With a monthly rent of $1,200, three months’ rent totals $3,600, which exceeds Plaintiff’s actual out‑of‑pocket property damage of approximately $400 and increased utility costs.

53. Plaintiff therefore seeks statutory damages of at least three months’ rent ($3,600), or such other amount as the Court deems just and proper, based on Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
