COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Mark Sullivan (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff was a lawful user of the public park and recreation paths located at or near 45 Park Ave, Newton, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mark Sullivan is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant was the owner and/or person in control and custody of a large dog (the “Dog”) and regularly used the Parks and Recreation Trails located at or near 45 Park Ave, Newton, Massachusetts.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for negligence arising out of personal injuries Plaintiff suffered in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

4. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and related provisions, the Newton Division of the District Court Department has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action, including personal injury actions where the amount in controversy does not exceed the statutory jurisdictional limit of the District Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court because the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, namely at the Parks and Recreation Trails located at or near 45 Park Ave, Newton, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 2–9.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about September 15, 2023, at approximately the afternoon hours, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a designated path within the Parks and Recreation Trails area located at 45 Park Ave, Newton, Massachusetts (the “Park”).

7. The Park contains posted signs stating that all dogs must be kept on a leash at all times on the premises.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant was present at the Park with the Dog, a large dog that Defendant customarily allows to run loose in the area.

9. On information and belief, Defendant is a regular user of the Park and has on prior occasions allowed the Dog to be off-leash in defiance of posted rules requiring that dogs be leashed.

10. On September 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was jogging on the path, Defendant was located approximately thirty (30) feet away from Plaintiff, socializing with friends.

11. At that time, Defendant had a leash draped over his shoulder or in his possession but did not have the leash attached to the Dog.

12. Suddenly and without warning, the Dog ran at high speed directly toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and aggressively.

13. The Dog’s rapid approach, barking, and apparent aggression placed Plaintiff in immediate and reasonable fear that the Dog would attack or bite her.

14. Defendant was at a distance from the Dog and was not exercising physical control over the Dog when it charged toward Plaintiff.

15. Plaintiff did not provoke, tease, or interact with the Dog in any way and was simply using the public jogging path in a normal and reasonable manner.

16. As the Dog charged and barked, Plaintiff reasonably perceived the Dog to pose an imminent threat of physical harm, including the possibility of being bitten or knocked down.

17. In an instinctive attempt to avoid what she reasonably believed was an imminent dog attack, Plaintiff swerved abruptly off the paved path to her side, trying to evade the Dog.

18. When Plaintiff swerved off the path, she struck or caught her foot on an exposed tree root or similar obstruction, causing her to lose balance.

19. As a result, Plaintiff fell down a small embankment adjacent to the path and landed forcefully on the ground, including on her wrist.

20. The Dog stopped its forward motion when Plaintiff fell, and thereafter Defendant called the Dog back to him and regained control.

21. The Dog did not actually make physical contact with Plaintiff; however, Plaintiff’s fall, and the resulting injuries, were a direct and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to control the Dog and of the Dog’s charging and barking at Plaintiff.

22. Several other joggers and bystanders in the Park, whose names are currently unknown to Plaintiff, witnessed the Dog’s charge toward Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s ensuing fall.

23. As a direct and proximate result of the incident described above, Plaintiff sustained a fracture to her wrist and associated soft tissue injuries.

24. Following the fall, Plaintiff required emergency medical treatment, including transport to a hospital emergency room, diagnostic imaging, immobilization, and subsequent follow-up medical care.

25. Plaintiff was required to wear a wrist brace for an extended period of time and to limit the use of her injured arm and hand in everyday activities.

26. Plaintiff’s medical expenses arising from the incident are approximately Three Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($3,200.00), and she continues to incur or reasonably expects to incur additional medical expenses in the future.

27. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time and lost wages in the approximate amount of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00).

28. Plaintiff also missed a piano recital for which she had been practicing and experienced loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and disruption to her normal activities during her recovery.

29. Plaintiff experienced, and continues to experience, pain, suffering, and emotional distress, including anxiety around dogs and jogging in public parks, as a result of the incident.

---

### IV. NEGLIGENCE (ONLY CLAIM)

30. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 29 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

#### Duty

31. Under Massachusetts law, a person owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable injury to others by his conduct. See, e.g., *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006) (recognizing general duty of reasonable care based on foreseeability); *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000).

32. Defendant, as the owner and/or person in control and custody of the Dog, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control, supervision, and restraint of the Dog so as to prevent the Dog from causing foreseeable harm to others lawfully using the Park. See *Maillet v. Mininno*, 266 Mass. 86, 89–90 (1929) (recognizing liability for failure to control animal where harm is foreseeable); *Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co.*, 283 Mass. 158, 161 (1933) (duty to prevent foreseeable harm from instrumentalities under one’s control).

33. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty to comply with applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations governing the control and restraint of dogs in public places, including laws requiring dogs to be restrained by a leash where posted. See G.L. c. 140, §§ 136A–174E (Massachusetts dog control statutes); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973) (duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors).

34. The posted signs in the Park requiring all dogs to be leashed placed Defendant on clear notice that his Dog was required to be restrained on a leash while in the Park.

#### Breach

35. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by failing to keep the Dog on a leash while in the Park, despite being on notice of the leash requirement and despite knowing, or reasonably should have known, that the Dog could run, chase, or charge at other park users.

36. Defendant further breached his duty by allowing the Dog to roam or run loose at a distance from him while he socialized with friends, thereby relinquishing effective control and supervision of the Dog.

37. Defendant knew or should have known that a large, unleashed dog running freely in a public jogging area created an unreasonable risk of harm to other park users, including the risk that the dog might chase, charge, or bark at them, causing them to fall or otherwise injure themselves. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. at 148–50 (foreseeable risk triggers duty of reasonable precautions).

38. Defendant also breached his duty by failing to take any precautionary steps to restrain the Dog when Plaintiff was approaching on the path, and by failing to prevent the Dog from charging directly toward Plaintiff while barking loudly and aggressively.

39. Defendant’s failure to adhere to the posted leash rules and to restrain and control the Dog constitutes unreasonable conduct that falls below the standard of care of a reasonably prudent dog owner under the circumstances. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. at 698–99; *O’Sullivan v. Shaw*, 431 Mass. 201, 204–05 (2000) (reasonableness of conduct measured by ordinary prudent person standard).

40. Violation of a statute, ordinance, or regulation intended to protect the public from a certain type of harm is evidence of negligence under Massachusetts law. See *Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990); *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196, 198–99 (1994). Defendant’s failure to leash the Dog, in contravention of posted rules and local leash requirements, is evidence of negligence.

#### Causation

41. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent failure to restrain and control the Dog, the Dog charged and barked at Plaintiff while she was jogging on the path.

42. It was reasonably foreseeable that allowing a large dog to run off-leash in a public jogging area and to charge at park users would cause them to take evasive action, including swerving or running away, which could in turn lead to a fall and physical injury. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639–40 (1996) (foreseeability of harm central to proximate cause); *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth.*, 376 Mass. 101, 105–06 (1978).

43. Plaintiff’s decision to swerve off the path in response to the Dog’s charge was a normal, instinctive, and foreseeable reaction to the apparent and imminent danger of an unleashed barking dog. Under Massachusetts law, a negligent actor is liable for injuries caused when another person reasonably reacts to the danger created by the actor’s negligence. See *Carter v. Yardley & Co., Ltd.*, 319 Mass. 92, 96–98 (1946) (defendant liable for injuries resulting from foreseeable reactions to created risk); *Solimene v. B. Grauel & Co., KG*, 399 Mass. 790, 794–96 (1987).

44. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting fractured wrist were the direct result of her foreseeable evasive action taken to avoid the Dog, which would not have occurred but for Defendant’s negligent conduct. See *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37, 45–47 (2009) (but-for causation and foreseeability); *Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002).

45. Any alleged intervening cause, such as the presence of a tree root or embankment near the path, was a normal and foreseeable condition of the Park and does not break the chain of causation. Defendant remains liable because his negligence set in motion the events that led to Plaintiff’s injury, and the risk of a jogger tripping or falling while taking evasive action to avoid a charging dog is within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. See *Jesionek*, 376 Mass. at 105–06; *Solimene*, 399 Mass. at 794–96.

46. The fact that the Dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff does not negate causation, because the harm arises from Plaintiff’s reasonable attempt to escape the danger negligently created by Defendant. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Plaintiff’s injuries.

#### Damages

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a fractured wrist and other injuries, and has suffered and will continue to suffer pain and suffering, physical impairment, and emotional distress. See *Rodrigues v. Miriam Hosp.*, 394 Mass. 704, 706–07 (1985) (recognizing recovery for pain and suffering and emotional distress associated with physical injury).

48. Plaintiff has incurred approximately Three Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($3,200.00) in medical expenses to date and reasonably anticipates incurring additional medical expenses related to her injuries in the future.

49. Plaintiff has lost wages in the approximate amount of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) due to her inability to work during her period of recovery.

50. Plaintiff has suffered loss of enjoyment of life and loss of ability to participate in activities she enjoys, including missing a piano recital for which she had prepared, and experiencing anxiety and diminished enjoyment in jogging and outdoor recreation.

51. Plaintiff’s total damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, are within the jurisdictional limits of this Court but exceed the small claims jurisdictional amount.

52. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff injured by another’s negligence is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by that negligence, including economic and noneconomic damages. See *Tobin v. Norwood Country Club, Inc.*, 422 Mass. 126, 134–35 (1996); *MacCormack v. Boston Edison Co.*, 423 Mass. 652, 662–63 (1996).
