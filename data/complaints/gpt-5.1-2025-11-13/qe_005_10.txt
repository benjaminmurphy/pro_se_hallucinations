COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
______________________________  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Thompson”) is an individual residing at 45 Willow Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Mark Henderson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Henderson”) is, upon information and belief, an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

3. This action arises from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s residential tenancy pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

4. The amount of damages sought by Plaintiff, exclusive of interest and costs, is $2,400, which is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court because the Premises are located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1–2.

6. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant owns and operates residential rental property in Massachusetts and has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in this Commonwealth. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease with Defendant for the apartment located at 45 Willow Street, Second Floor, Somerville, MA (the “Apartment”).

8. Pursuant to the lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent in the amount of $1,200 in exchange for the right to occupy the Apartment.

9. Defendant is the landlord and owner of the triple-decker residential building located at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, MA (the “Building”), which contains at least three residential units, including the Apartment (second floor) and a third-floor apartment located directly above Plaintiff.

10. The written lease between Plaintiff and Defendant expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Apartment.

11. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is also implied by statute and by law in Plaintiff’s tenancy, regardless of whether it is stated in the lease. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929) (recognizing quiet enjoyment as fundamental to a leasehold).

12. Plaintiff moved into the Apartment on or about January 1, 2022 and, for a significant period thereafter, enjoyed normal, reasonable residential conditions without persistent excessive noise disturbance.

13. Approximately six months before the filing of this Complaint, new tenants moved into the apartment directly above Plaintiff on the third floor (the “Upstairs Tenants”).

14. Shortly after the Upstairs Tenants moved in, Plaintiff began experiencing severe, frequent, and ongoing noise disturbances originating from the upstairs apartment.

15. These disturbances included loud, heavy footfall and stomping, what appeared to be furniture being dragged or moved late at night, loud music played at late hours, and other disruptive impact-type and amplified noise.

16. The noise frequently occurred at unreasonable hours, including late at night and during normal sleeping hours, such as around midnight and into the early morning.

17. The noise was of such a volume and character that it regularly penetrated Plaintiff’s Apartment, including her bedroom, and interfered with her ability to rest, relax, and sleep.

18. Plaintiff consistently experienced inadequate sleep, averaging approximately four to five hours of sleep per night, due to the ongoing noise from the Upstairs Tenants.

19. In an effort to resolve the situation amicably and informally, Plaintiff personally and directly requested that the Upstairs Tenants reduce the noise on multiple occasions.

20. Following one such request, the Upstairs Tenants briefly reduced the noise level for approximately one week, after which the excessive noise resumed and continued.

21. After the Upstairs Tenants failed to maintain quieter behavior, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the ongoing noise disturbances.

22. Over the course of several months, Plaintiff complained to Defendant about the excessive noise on approximately five or six separate occasions.

23. Plaintiff’s reports to Defendant described the type of noise, the frequency with which it occurred, and the late-night and early-morning hours during which the disturbances took place, as well as the resulting loss of sleep and disruption to her daily life.

24. Defendant initially responded by indicating that he would speak with the Upstairs Tenants.

25. Upon information and belief, Defendant spoke with the Upstairs Tenants only once following Plaintiff’s complaints.

26. After that single conversation, the Upstairs Tenants’ noise briefly decreased but then resumed and continued at similar or greater levels.

27. Thereafter, Defendant advised Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live” and failed and refused to take any further reasonable action to address or abate the disturbance, despite repeated notice and opportunity to do so.

28. Defendant did not investigate further, did not implement or enforce any building rules or lease provisions regarding excessive noise, did not provide any written warnings or notices to the Upstairs Tenants, and did not pursue any legal or administrative remedies against them.

29. Defendant also did not offer Plaintiff any reasonable accommodations such as a rent reduction, a transfer to another unit, or assistance in addressing the problem, and did not take steps to improve sound insulation or otherwise mitigate the disturbance.

30. The noise from the Upstairs Tenants, combined with Defendant’s failure to adequately respond, created a persistent, substantial, and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

31. The conditions, as described above, continued for a substantial period of time—approximately six months—and remained ongoing as of the filing of this Complaint.

32. As a direct result of this persistent disturbance, Plaintiff suffered from chronic sleep deprivation.

33. Plaintiff’s lack of sleep caused her to fall asleep at her workplace, leading to a written warning from her employer, thereby placing her employment in jeopardy.

34. Plaintiff sought medical treatment for sleep-related problems caused by the ongoing noise and disruption.

35. Plaintiff’s physician prescribed sleep medication to address her insomnia and resultant condition.

36. Plaintiff pays approximately $40 per month out-of-pocket for this sleep medication.

37. In addition, Plaintiff has made reasonable efforts at her own expense to mitigate the effects of the noise, including purchasing earplugs and a white noise machine, and rearranging her bedroom in an attempt to reduce exposure to the noise.

38. Despite these efforts, the conditions continued substantially unabated and Plaintiff was unable to obtain consistent, restorative sleep.

39. As a result of the ongoing disturbance and Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff has suffered significant loss of use and enjoyment of her Apartment.

40. Plaintiff’s Apartment has effectively ceased to be a reasonably habitable and restful dwelling for significant portions of the late evening and nighttime hours because of the noise.

41. Plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, anxiety, and physical symptoms of fatigue and exhaustion as a result of the ongoing disturbances and sleep deprivation.

42. Plaintiff has continued to pay her monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant despite the substantial interference with her tenancy.

43. At all relevant times, Defendant had actual and repeated notice of the noise disturbance and Plaintiff’s resulting loss of quiet enjoyment.

44. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant failed and refused to take reasonable steps to remedy or abate the conditions, and thereby permitted conditions to exist which substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

45. Defendant’s conduct, including his failure to act after repeated complaints, constituted an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the common law covenant of quiet enjoyment.

46. Plaintiff reasonably believes and therefore avers that Defendant’s failure to act was willful or, at a minimum, in reckless or knowing disregard of her rights as a tenant.

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to: loss of use and enjoyment of her Apartment, loss of sleep, medical expenses for treatment and prescription medication, risk to her employment, and emotional distress and inconvenience.

48. Plaintiff estimates her actual damages to be at least $2,400, representing, among other things, a reasonable measure of loss of use and enjoyment and related consequential harm.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Common Law)  

49. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 48 above as if fully set forth herein.

50. Massachusetts law provides a statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment for tenants. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

51. The right to quiet enjoyment is also implied by law in residential tenancies as an incident of the leasehold estate. See Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929) (recognizing covenant of quiet enjoyment as an implied incident of a lease); Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp., 340 Mass. 124, 127 (1959).

52. A landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 arises not only from his own affirmative acts, but also when he has notice of serious interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment and fails to take reasonable steps within his power to correct it. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 99–104 (1982) (landlord liable under § 14 for failure to remedy recurring serious conditions); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983–84 (1982) (landlord liable for failing to intervene to stop interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment).

53. An actionable breach of quiet enjoyment occurs where there is a “substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.” Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); see also Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977) (substantial noise from adjacent lounge constituted breach of quiet enjoyment).

54. In Blackett v. Olanoff, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord may be liable under the covenant of quiet enjoyment where noise and disturbances from other tenants or occupants, over whom the landlord has control or with whom the landlord has a contractual relationship, substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment, and the landlord fails to take reasonable steps to prevent or abate the disturbance. 371 Mass. at 717–19.

55. Similarly, in Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–53 (1997), the Court recognized that a landlord’s knowing failure to remedy conditions substantially interfering with a tenant’s enjoyment, after notice and opportunity to cure, can constitute a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

56. Here, the excessive, ongoing, and late-night noise from the Upstairs Tenants—who are tenants of Defendant in the same Building—constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her Apartment.

57. Defendant had actual notice of the disturbances through Plaintiff’s numerous complaints over a substantial time period.

58. Defendant had the ability and authority to exercise reasonable control over the Upstairs Tenants, including but not limited to: enforcing lease provisions and house rules; issuing written warnings or notices to cure; threatening or initiating eviction proceedings for persistent violations; and taking reasonable steps to investigate and address the noise.

59. Despite this notice and authority, Defendant failed and refused to take reasonable steps to prevent or abate the noise and resulting interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

60. Defendant’s response—to speak once with the Upstairs Tenants and then disclaim any responsibility by stating he “can’t control how people live”—was unreasonable and inadequate in light of the ongoing, serious interference.

61. As in Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19, Defendant’s inaction in the face of predictable and continuing interference from other tenants in the building constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

62. Moreover, Massachusetts law makes clear that a landlord’s failure to respond to recurring conditions that substantially impair a tenant’s use and enjoyment can violate G.L. c. 186, § 14, even where the landlord did not personally create the disturbance. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 99–104; Limoli v. Accettullo, 358 Mass. 381, 383–84 (1970) (landlord liable for failure to act to correct nuisances or interferences within his control).

63. The persistent noise and disturbances described herein were not trivial, temporary inconveniences; they were ongoing, late-night, and severe, and they directly impaired Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and make normal residential use of the Apartment.

64. The interference in this case is comparable in severity to conditions Massachusetts courts have found to violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment, such as persistent flooding, leaks, and environmental disturbances. See, e.g., Simon, 385 Mass. at 99–104 (recurring flooding and sewage backups); Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85 (harassing and dangerous conditions).

65. The resulting sleep deprivation, need for medical treatment and prescription sleep medication, and the risk to Plaintiff’s employment—as evidenced by a written warning for falling asleep at work—demonstrate the seriousness of the interference and the foreseeable harm caused by Defendant’s failure to act. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 105–06 (recognizing consequential and emotional distress damages under § 14).

66. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is further reinforced in residential tenancies by G.L. c. 239, § 8A, which allows tenants to assert violations of G.L. c. 186, § 14 as defenses and counterclaims in summary process and reflects the strong public policy in favor of protecting tenants from substantial interferences with their tenancies.

67. Additionally, G.L. c. 93A, § 2 and related housing regulations (e.g., 940 C.M.R. 3.17) reflect the Commonwealth’s policy that unreasonable failure to correct serious conditions affecting the use and habitability of residential premises is an unfair or deceptive practice, further underscoring the seriousness with which Massachusetts law treats interference with quiet enjoyment, although Plaintiff does not assert a separate G.L. c. 93A claim in this Complaint.

68. By allowing the conditions described above to persist after repeated notice, and by failing to take reasonable and available measures to address or stop the disturbance, Defendant “directly or indirectly interfere[d] with the quiet enjoyment” of Plaintiff’s Apartment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

69. Defendant’s conduct was willful or, at a minimum, in knowing or reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, because he had repeated notice of substantial interference and deliberately chose not to take further action.

70. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who violates the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or, in any event, not less than three months’ rent, and for costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–52; Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979).

71. Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, including: loss of use and enjoyment of her Apartment; sleep deprivation and related physical and emotional distress; out-of-pocket medical and prescription costs; and adverse employment consequences and risk.

72. At all relevant times, Plaintiff remained current on her rent obligations and fulfilled her duties under the lease, and therefore is entitled to full protection of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973) (recognizing tenant’s right to habitable premises).

73. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be determined at trial, but reasonably estimated at no less than $2,400, plus interest, costs, and such additional relief as this Court deems just.
