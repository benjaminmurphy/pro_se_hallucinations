COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
MIDDLESEX DIVISION  

-----------------------------------------------------  
Docket No. ____________  

EMILY JOHNSON,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL SMITH,  
  Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; G.L. c. 215, § 6)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), self‑represented, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court issued the existing custody and parenting time judgment/order in this matter on May 14, 2019 (the “2019 Judgment”).

2. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of judgments as to care, custody, and maintenance of minor children) and, to the extent applicable, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, the Probate and Family Court retains continuing jurisdiction to modify prior orders relating to legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.

3. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the original judgment was entered in this Division and the minor child, Jacob Smith, resides within Middlesex County.

### II. PARTIES

4. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the mother of the minor child:

   - Jacob Smith, date of birth: [REDACTED FOR PRIVACY] (age 8).

5. The Defendant, Michael Smith (“Defendant” or “Father”), is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the father of the minor child, Jacob Smith.

6. The parties are the parents of Jacob Smith and are both subject to the 2019 Judgment of this Court concerning custody and parenting time.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / CURRENT ORDER

7. On or about May 14, 2019, when Jacob was approximately three (3) years old, this Court entered an order/judgment (the “2019 Judgment”) granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of Jacob.

8. Under the 2019 Judgment, the Defendant was awarded parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit, with no overnights.

9. The 2019 Judgment did not provide for overnight parenting time with the Defendant, largely because, at that time, the Defendant lived only in a single room in a shared apartment with roommates and had no separate bedroom or appropriate sleeping space for a young child.

10. The 2019 Judgment has remained in effect without modification since May 14, 2019.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

11. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests and welfare of the minor child, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law, including but not limited to:  
    - Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
    - Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
    - Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

12. At the time of the 2019 Judgment, Jacob was approximately three (3) years old and not yet in full‑time elementary school; the parenting schedule was designed for a preschool‑age child and for a non‑residential parent who did not have suitable housing for overnights.

13. Jacob is now eight (8) years old and in full‑time elementary school. His developmental, educational, social, and emotional needs have changed significantly since age three.

14. The Defendant has substantially improved his housing situation. He now has his own apartment, with appropriate space and accommodations for Jacob, including a separate bedroom for the child.

15. The central reason that the Court did not order overnights in 2019—namely, the Defendant’s lack of suitable housing and a private sleeping space for Jacob—no longer exists.

16. Under the current schedule, Jacob is shuttled back and forth for several short visits during the week on school nights. This frequent transition schedule causes:

    a. Disruption to Jacob’s homework routines;  
    b. Difficulties maintaining consistent bedtimes and sleep schedules; and  
    c. Increased logistical stress for both parents and the child.

17. Jacob has expressed a consistent and age‑appropriate desire to have overnight visits and “sleepovers” at his father’s home, which he now perceives as a stable, suitable environment and where he has his own bedroom.

18. Both parents—Mother and Father—agree that the existing schedule is no longer well‑suited to Jacob’s age, school schedule, and needs, and both support a modification to a more age‑appropriate and less disruptive parenting time arrangement that includes overnights with Father.

19. The parties’ mutual recognition that the existing judgment no longer serves Jacob’s best interests is a significant circumstance for the Court’s consideration. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (court considers the parties’ conduct and cooperation in evaluating best interests and modification).

20. The current parenting time arrangement, appropriate when Jacob was three and Father lacked suitable housing, has become impractical and contrary to Jacob’s best interests now that he is eight, in school full time, and Father has appropriate housing.

21. These changes—Jacob’s increased age and developmental stage, his full‑time school enrollment, Father’s acquisition of appropriate housing and a separate bedroom for the child, Jacob’s expressed desire for overnights with Father, and both parents’ agreement that the current schedule should be adjusted—collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2019 Judgment. See, e.g.:

    a. G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification permitted upon showing of material and substantial change and best interests of the child);  
    b. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests standard governs custody and parenting time);  
    c. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
    d. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (emphasizing stability, but allowing modification where circumstances change materially);  
    e. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (modification when circumstances demand change in parenting arrangements).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

22. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting time determination is the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 844; Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).

23. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court must consider the child’s welfare and happiness, the past and present parental responsibilities, the ability of each parent to provide for the child’s needs, and the child’s relationship with each parent.

24. Jacob has a loving and meaningful relationship with both Mother and Father. Increasing and rationalizing Father’s parenting time to include overnights—while maintaining Mother’s primary physical custody—will foster and strengthen Jacob’s relationship with Father without undermining his relationship with Mother.

25. A parenting schedule that includes regular overnights with Father on weekends (and, if appropriate, limited school‑night overnights) will:

    a. Reduce the number of transitions between households during the school week;  
    b. Provide Jacob with longer, more settled periods of time with each parent;  
    c. Support more consistent homework and bedtime routines; and  
    d. Promote stability, predictability, and emotional security for Jacob.

26. As Massachusetts courts have repeatedly recognized, stability and continuity in a child’s life are crucial to the child’s best interests. See, e.g., Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–96; Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007). The requested modification seeks to enhance—not diminish—Jacob’s stability by aligning parenting time with his age and school schedule.

27. Jacob’s expressed desire for overnight visits with Father, while not controlling, is a relevant and appropriate factor given his age and maturity. See Care & Protection of Emily, 433 Mass. 562 (2001) (a child’s expressed preferences may be considered as one factor in best‑interests analysis).

28. Both parents’ agreement that the current schedule is no longer workable and that an updated schedule including overnights with Father is in Jacob’s best interests is further evidence that modification is warranted. The Court is empowered to modify orders in such circumstances where the change will benefit the child. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

29. The requested modification will maintain Mother’s role as primary physical custodian, consistent with the original judgment, while allowing Jacob to enjoy more meaningful, age‑appropriate parenting time with Father, in a now‑suitable home environment. This balance is consistent with the policies underlying G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the caselaw favoring frequent and continuing contact with both parents when safe and appropriate. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, supra.

30. There is no allegation in this Complaint of abuse, neglect, or unfitness by either parent. The requested modification is driven solely by positive changes in Father’s circumstances, Jacob’s growth and developmental needs, and both parents’ shared assessment of what is best for Jacob now.

### VI. APPLICABLE LAW AND STANDARD

31. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Probate and Family Court may “from time to time, upon a complaint for modification, modify its earlier judgment as to the care, custody, and maintenance of the minor children” upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where such modification is in the best interests of the child.

32. G.L. c. 208, § 31 sets forth that custody determinations shall be made in accordance with the best interests of the child, and recognizes that children should have frequent and continuing contact with both parents when consistent with their best interests.

33. Massachusetts appellate decisions confirm that a party seeking modification of a custody or parenting time judgment bears the burden of demonstrating (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior judgment, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See, e.g.:

   a. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   b. Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   c. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010);  
   d. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981);  
   e. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996);  
   f. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   g. Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998);  
   h. Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   i. Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007);  
   j. Care & Protection of Emily, 433 Mass. 562 (2001).

34. Where, as here, the principal basis for a restrictive parenting time order (no overnights due to unsuitable housing) has been remedied, and the child’s needs have evolved significantly with age and schooling, courts routinely find that a material change has occurred and that expanded and more normalized parenting time is appropriate, provided it aligns with the child’s best interests.

35. Applying these legal principles, the facts alleged above satisfy both prongs of the modification standard:

   a. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances (Jacob’s age and school enrollment; Father’s improved housing with a bedroom for the child; the impracticality of frequent short visits; and both parents’ agreement that modification is necessary); and  

   b. A parenting schedule including overnights with Father, with Mother retaining primary physical custody, is in Jacob’s best interests.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

36. The Plaintiff does not seek to alter legal custody if joint or shared legal custody is currently in effect, nor does she seek to disturb her status as primary physical custodian. The principal relief sought is a modification of the parenting time schedule to add age‑appropriate overnights with the Defendant and to reduce the number of brief, disruptive school‑night transitions.

37. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter a Modified Parenting Time Order that:

   a. Confirms that the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, remains the primary physical custodian of Jacob Smith;  

   b. Grants the Defendant, Michael Smith, regular overnight parenting time, at a minimum to include:  

      i. Alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m.) until Sunday at 5:00 p.m. (or return to school Monday morning, as the Court deems appropriate); and  

      ii. Such additional overnight or extended weekday parenting time as the Court finds to be in Jacob’s best interests, taking into account his school schedule and the parties’ work schedules;  

   c. Replaces the existing three short mid‑week visits and Sunday afternoon‑only schedule with a more consolidated schedule that is less disruptive to Jacob’s schooling, homework, and sleep routines;  

   d. Provides that the parties shall cooperate in good faith in transporting Jacob, exchanging information about his schooling and activities, and supporting his relationship with the other parent; and  

   e. Includes such additional and related provisions concerning holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time as the Court deems appropriate to serve Jacob’s best interests.

38. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court find that the modification is warranted because:

   a. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2019 Judgment; and  

   b. The requested modification of parenting time is in the best interests of the minor child, Jacob Smith, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31 and the cases cited above.

### VIII. GENERAL PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 14, 2019 custody and parenting time order;

B. Find that modification of the existing parenting time schedule is in the best interests of the minor child, Jacob Smith;

C. Enter a Modified Parenting Time Order:

   1. Maintaining Emily Johnson as the primary physical custodian of Jacob Smith;  

   2. Granting Michael Smith regular overnight parenting time, including at least alternating weekend overnights and such additional parenting time as the Court deems appropriate in light of Jacob’s age and schooling;  

   3. Eliminating or substantially revising the existing three short mid‑week visits and Sunday‑afternoon‑only visit, in favor of a more age‑appropriate and less disruptive schedule that includes overnights; and  

   4. Providing such further and related terms for holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time as are consistent with Jacob’s best interests;

D. Order that the parties continue to share information and cooperate regarding Jacob’s education, medical care, and extracurricular activities, and that each parent encourage and support Jacob’s relationship with the other parent;

E. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,
