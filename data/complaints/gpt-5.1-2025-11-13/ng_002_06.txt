                     COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                             I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a lawful user of Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual residing in Massachusetts, who regularly uses Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times owned, kept, and/or controlled the dog involved in the incident described below.

                   II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries arising from Defendant’s negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. Pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A, and applicable jurisdictional provisions, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court Department.

5. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court because the incident giving rise to this action occurred at Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts, which lies within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

                         III. JURY DEMAND

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 60 and applicable rules, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

                      IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts, is a public park with walking and jogging paths that are regularly used by members of the public, including Plaintiff.

8. At all times relevant, Newton maintained and posted park rules requiring that all dogs be kept on leashes while in the park, including on the jogging paths.

9. On April 15, 2023, at approximately mid‑afternoon, Plaintiff was lawfully jogging on a path in Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts.

10. Plaintiff was running at a normal pace and remaining on the designated path, using due care for her own safety.

11. On multiple prior occasions before April 15, 2023, Plaintiff had observed Defendant in Whiting Park allowing his large dog to run off‑leash in areas where signs required dogs to be leashed.

12. On April 15, 2023, Defendant was again present in Whiting Park with his large dog.

13. At the time of the incident, Defendant’s dog was not on a leash, notwithstanding the posted leash requirement.

14. Defendant stood approximately thirty (30) feet away from Plaintiff, talking with friends, while his dog was loose and not under proper physical control.

15. Although Defendant held a leash over his shoulder, he did not have the leash attached to the dog.

16. As Plaintiff jogged along the path, Defendant’s dog suddenly and aggressively charged toward Plaintiff from the side of the path, barking loudly.

17. The dog’s rapid approach, size, and loud barking created a reasonable and immediate fear in Plaintiff that the dog was about to bite or physically attack her.

18. From Plaintiff’s perspective, the dog’s conduct was threatening and menacing, and its path and speed gave Plaintiff no reasonable assurance that she would not be bitten or otherwise injured.

19. Defendant failed to call, restrain, or otherwise control his dog prior to its charge toward Plaintiff.

20. Defendant’s dog closed the distance toward Plaintiff quickly, and Plaintiff had only moments to react.

21. In a reasonable attempt to avoid an imminent perceived attack by the dog, Plaintiff swerved off the jogging path and away from the dog’s path of travel.

22. As Plaintiff swerved off the path, she encountered an exposed tree root and uneven ground near the edge of a small embankment.

23. Plaintiff’s foot caught on the tree root, causing her to trip and lose her balance.

24. As a direct result of tripping, Plaintiff fell down the embankment and landed forcefully on her wrist and other parts of her body.

25. The dog stopped when Plaintiff fell, and only after Plaintiff had already fallen did Defendant call the dog back to him.

26. The dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff; however, its off‑leash charge and aggressive barking were the direct and foreseeable cause of Plaintiff’s evasive movement and consequent fall.

27. Several other joggers and park users in the vicinity witnessed the dog’s charge, Plaintiff’s attempt to avoid the dog, and Plaintiff’s subsequent fall.

28. Emergency medical care was required as a result of the fall.

29. Plaintiff was transported to or presented at an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with a broken (fractured) wrist.

30. Plaintiff’s injury required immobilization with a brace or similar device and caused her substantial pain and loss of function in her wrist and hand.

31. Plaintiff’s medical expenses related to the injury total approximately $5,200, including but not limited to emergency room charges, diagnostic imaging, follow‑up appointments, and medical supplies.

32. Plaintiff’s injury prevented her from working for a period of time, causing her to lose approximately $2,000 in wages.

33. Plaintiff’s injury also prevented her from performing and participating in activities important to her, including a piano recital for which she had been practicing for an extended period.

34. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer pain, discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional distress due to the incident and resulting injury.

35. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused by the negligent acts and omissions of Defendant in failing to keep his dog leashed and under control in violation of posted park rules and applicable local and state law, and in failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.

36. Plaintiff did not act unreasonably under the circumstances; her reaction to the charging, barking dog was a normal, instinctive, and foreseeable response to an apparent, imminent risk of being bitten or otherwise attacked.

37. Plaintiff was at all relevant times exercising reasonable care for her own safety.

                           V. NEGLIGENCE

(Only Cause of Action)

38. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–37 as if fully set forth herein.

39. Under Massachusetts common law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. See, e.g., Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (duty of reasonable care arises where a reasonably prudent person would anticipate harm); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

40. In particular, one who owns, keeps, or controls a dog owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the dog from causing foreseeable injury to others, including injury caused by a reasonably foreseeable attempt to escape the dog’s threatening conduct. See Andrews v. Jordan Marsh Co., 283 Mass. 158, 161–63 (1933) (liability where plaintiff fell while fleeing threatened harm); Hill v. Winsor, 118 Mass. 251, 259–60 (1875) (foreseeable peril created by defendant’s conduct).

41. A defendant’s duty of reasonable care extends to injuries that are a foreseeable consequence of the risk created, including injuries suffered while a plaintiff reasonably attempts to avoid danger caused by the defendant’s negligence. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 640–41 (1996); Jesionek v. Mass. Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978).

42. Under G.L. c. 140, § 173 and related municipal and state provisions, municipalities may require that dogs be under restraint or on leash in public areas; Newton has posted and enforced such rules in its parks, requiring that all dogs be kept on leashes.

43. The posted leash‑law signs in Whiting Park put Defendant on actual notice that allowing his dog to be off‑leash in the park, and particularly on and near jogging paths, was prohibited and unsafe.

44. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that allowing a large dog to run loose and to charge, barking, at joggers in a public park posed a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm, including falls, evasive reactions, and serious physical injury.

45. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to control his dog so as to prevent the dog from menacing, charging at, or otherwise endangering park users, including Plaintiff. See Glidden v. Szybiak, 338 Mass. 190, 192–93 (1958) (recognizing liability associated with dog‑related injuries under Massachusetts law); Brown v. Bolduc, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 910 (1990) (discussing duties of dog owners).

46. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care, including but not limited to the following acts and omissions:

   a. Failing to keep his dog on a leash as required by posted rules and applicable law;

   b. Allowing his dog to roam loose in an area of the park used by joggers and pedestrians;

   c. Failing to maintain physical control of his dog despite having a leash readily available;

   d. Failing to supervise and monitor his dog when the dog was in close proximity to park users, including Plaintiff;

   e. Failing to call or restrain his dog before it charged toward Plaintiff;

   f. Failing to anticipate and prevent the dog’s charge and aggressive barking at Plaintiff;

   g. Disregarding known and obvious risks posed by a large, off‑leash dog in a crowded public park; and

   h. Otherwise failing to act as a reasonably prudent dog owner would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

47. Defendant’s breach of duty directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries. Massachusetts law recognizes that “a negligent actor is liable not only for harm caused directly but also for harm resulting from a reasonable attempt by the other to escape the danger created by the actor’s negligence.” See Graci v. Damon, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 163–64 (1977) (discussing proximate cause and foreseeable escape efforts); see also Jesionek, 376 Mass. at 105.

48. It was reasonably foreseeable that a jogger, when confronted suddenly with a large, barking dog charging at her off‑leash, would instinctively swerve or take evasive action to avoid what appeared to be an imminent attack. See Andrews, 283 Mass. at 162–63 (defendant liable where plaintiff jumped to avoid perceived danger created by defendant’s negligence); Hill, 118 Mass. at 259–60.

49. Plaintiff’s evasive maneuver to avoid the charging dog was a normal, reasonable, and foreseeable reaction to the danger created by Defendant’s negligent failure to restrain and control his dog, and does not constitute a superseding cause that would relieve Defendant of liability. See Jesionek, 376 Mass. at 105; Graci, 5 Mass. App. Ct. at 164.

50. Plaintiff’s fall over the tree root and down the embankment was within the scope of the foreseeable risk created by Defendant’s negligent conduct, and therefore constitutes a legal and proximate result of that negligence. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 147–48 (foreseeability and scope of risk); Davis, 420 Mass. at 743–44.

51. Plaintiff did not voluntarily assume the risk of Defendant’s negligence and did not provoke or interact with Defendant’s dog in any way prior to the dog’s charge.

52. To the extent any comparative negligence on the part of Plaintiff is alleged, Plaintiff states that any such negligence was less than that of Defendant and, in any event, her recovery is governed by G.L. c. 231, § 85, which permits recovery so long as her negligence, if any, was not greater than the negligence of Defendant.

53. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist and attendant physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and suffered pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

54. Under Massachusetts law, a tortfeasor is liable for all damages that are the natural and probable consequences of the negligent act. See Wallace v. Ludwig, 292 Mass. 251, 254–55 (1935); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 431–435 (persuasive authority often relied upon by Massachusetts courts).

55. Accordingly, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages allowed by law, including special and general damages, as more fully described below.

                        VI. DAMAGES

56. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following injuries and damages:

   a. A broken wrist, including pain, swelling, and limited mobility;

   b. Past and future physical pain and suffering related to the wrist fracture and its sequelae;

   c. Approximately $5,200 in medical expenses, including emergency room treatment, diagnostic testing, follow‑up visits, and associated costs;

   d. Approximately $2,000 in lost wages due to inability to work following the injury;

   e. Loss of enjoyment of life, including the inability to engage in normal recreational and artistic activities such as piano playing and participation in a scheduled piano recital;

   f. Emotional distress and anxiety associated with the incident, including fear of dogs and apprehension when using public parks and paths; and

   g. Such other special and general damages as may be proven at trial.

57. Plaintiff is entitled to recover pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest on her damages as allowed by G.L. c. 231, § 6B (interest in tort actions for personal injuries) and G.L. c. 235, § 8.

58. Plaintiff is also entitled to costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 261 and applicable rules of civil procedure.

                     VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be well in excess of the District Court’s minimum jurisdictional amount, for:

   1. Past and future medical expenses, including approximately $5,200 already incurred;

   2. Past and future lost wages and loss of earning capacity, including approximately $2,000 in wages already lost;

   3. Past and future pain and suffering;

   4. Emotional distress and mental anguish;

   5. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with usual and recreational activities;

B. An award of pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest as provided by G.L. c. 231, § 6B and G.L. c. 235, § 8;

C. An award of costs of suit as allowed by G.L. c. 261 and the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure;

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                    VIII. REQUEST FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff hereby reiterates her demand for a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Dated: December 1, 2025  

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
EMILY JOHNSON
