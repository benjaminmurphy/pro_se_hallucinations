      "proposition": "To the extent necessary, Mother requests a temporary order pending final hearing, modifying parenting time to remove the midweek overnight if and when Father relocates to New Hampshire or to any other location that causes similarly burdensome travel for Emily on school nights, so as to prevent ongoing harm and disruption to her schooling and routines.",

      "supports_proposition": false,
      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The case concerns post-divorce modification of alimony and the effect of a merged separation agreement; it does not address parenting time, relocation, school-night travel burdens, or temporary orders regarding custody/visitation. Nothing in the opinion provides a legal standard or authority for modifying midweek overnights due to a parent\u2019s relocation or impacts on a child\u2019s schooling. Therefore it does not support the specific parenting-time proposition cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"A party seeking to modify a judgment for alimony or child support 'must demonstrate a material change in circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment.' Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981), citing Robbins v. Robbins, 343 Mass. 247, 249 (1961). 'In determining whether to modify a support or alimony order, a probate judge must weigh all relevant circumstances' (emphasis added). Schuler v. Schuler, supra at 370.\""
