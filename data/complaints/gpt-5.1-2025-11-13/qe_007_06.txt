  Plaintiff,  

v.

Civil Action No. __________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Liam Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Marissa Kent (“Defendant” or “Landlord”) and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Liam Johnson is an individual residing at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Apartment ___, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02138 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Marissa Kent is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental property located at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, including the Premises rented by Plaintiff.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the “landlord” of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, and has been responsible for managing, maintaining, and controlling the Premises and adjoining rental units.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19–19A and G.L. c. 185C, as this is a civil action involving residential landlord‑tenant rights and arises from conduct occurring in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

5. Venue is proper in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 218, § 19, because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138.

7. Plaintiff has resided continuously at the Premises since June 1, 2022, and currently remains a lawful tenant.

8. Plaintiff’s rent is $2,200 per month, payable to Defendant.

9. As of all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff has been current in his rent and has complied with his obligations as a tenant.

10. Plaintiff works from home and regularly conducts work‑related phone and video calls from the Premises during normal business hours.

11. Around early October 2025, Defendant began or caused to be begun substantial renovation and construction work in the residential unit immediately adjacent to the Premises (the “Renovation Work”).

12. The Renovation Work has consisted of, among other things, frequent drilling, hammering, sawing, and loud conversation among construction workers.

13. The Renovation Work has typically occurred on weekdays, from approximately 8:00 a.m. until approximately 5:00 p.m., and has continued on a near‑daily basis for approximately two months to date.

14. The noise from the Renovation Work is loud and intrusive inside Plaintiff’s unit and has significantly interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to hear and be heard on work‑related calls and to perform his job duties.

15. During the Renovation Work, dust and debris have repeatedly entered Plaintiff’s unit through vents and other openings, causing visible dust accumulation in the Premises and impacting the cleanliness and comfort of the apartment.

16. The dust infiltration has required Plaintiff to repeatedly clean surfaces and has caused him concern about air quality in his living and working space.

17. Before the Renovation Work began, Defendant informed Plaintiff that there would be construction in the neighboring unit and that it would occur during daytime hours.

18. Defendant’s notice did not reasonably convey the magnitude, duration, and intensity of the noise and dust that would result from the Renovation Work, nor its impact on a tenant working from home full‑time.

19. Defendant has allowed the Renovation Work to continue in its current manner for approximately two months and, on information and belief, has indicated that it may continue for an additional one to two months.

20. Plaintiff has communicated to Defendant that the Renovation Work is substantially interfering with his ability to quietly enjoy and use the Premises as his home and workplace.

21. Plaintiff has explained to Defendant that the noise and dust materially impair his ability to conduct remote work, participate in meetings and calls, and enjoy the normal, quiet use of his apartment.

22. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant offered Plaintiff a one‑time rent reduction of approximately $100 off one month’s rent.

23. The one‑time $100 reduction is nominal and does not reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the loss of quiet enjoyment, disruption to his work, and loss of use of the Premises during the two‑month period of intense construction, nor for the anticipated continued disruption.

24. Defendant has not meaningfully altered, limited, rescheduled, or mitigated the Renovation Work in response to Plaintiff’s concerns—for example, by relocating Plaintiff, scheduling the noisiest work at restricted times, providing filtration to reduce dust, or otherwise taking reasonable steps to alleviate the interference.

25. As a result of the ongoing Renovation Work, the Premises have been subjected to persistent loud noise and dust infiltration during the bulk of Plaintiff’s waking and working hours, rendering the apartment significantly less habitable and less useful for its intended residential and work‑from‑home purposes.

26. The interference has been substantial and has gone well beyond the level of ordinary, incidental noise and inconvenience that a residential tenant might reasonably be expected to tolerate in an urban multi‑unit building.

27. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a quiet residence and workspace has been seriously impaired; Plaintiff has struggled to conduct business calls, has been distracted and stressed, and has at times been unable to use portions of the day effectively for work due to the level of noise.

28. Plaintiff’s loss of quiet enjoyment has continued on a regular basis during the two‑month period and is expected to continue during the additional month or two of Renovation Work indicated by Defendant.

29. Plaintiff estimates that he has suffered at least $600 in damages due to the substantial interference with his quiet enjoyment of the Premises, including, but not limited to: loss of use and enjoyment of the apartment; disruption to work; time and effort in dealing with the conditions; and loss of the full value of the rented premises during the period of disruption.

30. Defendant, as landlord, is responsible in law for the acts and omissions of her contractors and workers, and for the decision to conduct—and to continue to conduct—the Renovation Work in a manner that unreasonably interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

31. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–30 above as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects a tenant against serious interference with the tenancy by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s control. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977).

33. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides in relevant part that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when the landlord, or those acting with the landlord’s permission or under the landlord’s control, create or permit substantial interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, even without an intent to harass the tenant. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

35. A landlord’s liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 may arise from affirmative acts, from a course of conduct, or from a failure to take reasonable steps to prevent or stop serious interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment occurring on property under the landlord’s control. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Jablonski v. Casey, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–48 (2005).

36. Substantial, continuing noise and disturbance emanating from property or activities controlled by the landlord can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (noise from lounge controlled by landlord); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994) (repeated disturbances and harassment); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (repeated interferences may support liability under § 14).

37. Here, Defendant, through her own decisions and through contractors and workers acting under her authority and control, has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment by conducting prolonged, intensive Renovation Work immediately adjacent to the Premises, resulting in sustained, excessive noise and dust infiltration inside Plaintiff’s apartment.

38. Defendant knew or should have known that the level, duration, and proximity of the Renovation Work—drilling, hammering, loud conversation, and dust infiltration from early morning to late afternoon on most weekdays for months—would substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises as a home and as his primary place of work.

39. Defendant has had the ability to control, schedule, limit, mitigate, or otherwise manage the Renovation Work—including but not limited to the timing, methods, and extent of loud activities, and measures to control dust—but has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent or meaningfully reduce the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

40. Defendant’s decision to continue the Renovation Work in its current manner, despite Plaintiff’s complaints and the known interference, constitutes at least negligent, and in any event unreasonably indifferent, interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

41. The interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy has been substantial, not trivial or momentary, and has persisted for a significant period of time (approximately two months to date, with further interference expected).

42. The Renovation Work and resulting noise and dust substantially impaired the character and value of the Premises for Plaintiff’s ordinary residential use and for his foreseeable work‑from‑home use, which Defendant was or should have been aware of.

43. The limited, one‑time $100 rent reduction offered by Defendant does not cure or negate the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nor does it reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the disruption and loss of use he has suffered.

44. Plaintiff’s damages, including loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, disruption to work, and diminution in the value of the housing services provided during the affected period, constitute “actual and consequential damages” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 110–11; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789 (1994).

45. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, upon proof of interference with quiet enjoyment, a tenant is entitled to recover either (a) actual and consequential damages or (b) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 400 (1982); Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 789.

46. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $2,200; three months’ rent would equal $6,600. Plaintiff presently seeks an award of $600 in damages, which he believes fairly and conservatively reflects the actual damage to his use and enjoyment of the Premises to date.

47. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts case law interpreting that statute, including but not limited to Blackett v. Olanoff, Simon v. Solomon, Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., and Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer loss of use and enjoyment of his home, stress and inconvenience, disruption to his ability to work from home, and monetary damages estimated at $600.

49. Defendant’s acts and omissions complained of herein occurred within the context of a residential tenancy and are of the type that G.L. c. 186, § 14 is intended to prevent and remedy. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Lowery, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983.

50. Plaintiff therefore is entitled to judgment against Defendant for damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, together with costs, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Liam Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant Marissa Kent and grant the following relief:

D. Such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
