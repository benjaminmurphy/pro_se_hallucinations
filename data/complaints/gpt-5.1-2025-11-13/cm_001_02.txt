COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Custody and Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Emily Johnson (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Ethan Johnson (date of birth: __________, age 6) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Defendant” or “Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the Court’s inherent and statutory authority to modify prior custody and parenting-time orders upon a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor children.

4. The Middlesex Probate and Family Court (the “Court”) entered the current custody and parenting-time judgment/order in this matter on or about May 15, 2020 (the “Existing Order”).

5. Venue and jurisdiction are proper in this Court because the prior judgment was issued by this Court, the parties and the Children reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and this Complaint seeks modification of an existing custody and parenting-time order concerning minor children who reside in this Court’s jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 208, § 6; G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

6. On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) establishing legal custody and parenting time for the Children.

7. Under the Existing Order, the parties share joint legal custody of the Children, with primary physical custody to the Plaintiff and parenting time to the Defendant every other weekend and one overnight during the week (the “Midweek Overnight”).

8. At the time the Existing Order was entered, both parties worked regular daytime schedules. The parenting plan was negotiated and/or ordered based on the understanding that both parents would be awake, available, and able to directly supervise the Children during their overnights.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

9. Since entry of the Existing Order on May 15, 2020, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the custody and parenting-time provisions, specifically relating to the Defendant’s work schedule and his ability to safely and reliably exercise overnight parenting time.

10. The Defendant has recently accepted and begun working a new job with overnight shifts, where he works approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights on which he is scheduled to have the Children overnight pursuant to the Existing Order.

11. As a result of this new shift work, the Defendant is frequently either:
   a. Physically absent from the home and thus unable to supervise or care for the Children during his scheduled overnights; and/or  
   b. Extremely fatigued before, during, and after his shifts, such that he is unable to provide appropriate supervision and care when the Children are in his custody.

12. On numerous occasions, the Defendant has, with little or no advance notice, dropped the Children off at the Plaintiff’s residence during times that were scheduled as his parenting time, stating that he is too tired to care for them after his overnight shifts.

13. On other occasions, when he has not returned the Children to the Plaintiff, the Defendant has instead left the Children in the care of his roommate, an adult whom the Plaintiff barely knows, and with whom the Children have no established relationship.

14. The Plaintiff has not been consulted about, nor has she agreed to, the Defendant’s delegation of his overnight parenting responsibilities to his roommate, and the Plaintiff has reasonable concerns about the adequacy and appropriateness of this caregiving arrangement, particularly during overnight hours.

15. The Children have reported to the Plaintiff that, during the Defendant’s parenting time, they often fall asleep on the couch while the Defendant is napping or sleeping after returning from his overnight shifts.

16. The Children’s description of these visits indicates that they may not have a consistent bedtime routine, proper supervision, or safe sleeping arrangements during some of the Defendant’s overnight parenting times.

17. The Defendant’s new work schedule and related fatigue significantly impair his ability to personally exercise parenting time as contemplated in the Existing Order and undermine the assumptions on which the present parenting plan was based.

18. The Defendant’s pattern of returning the Children to the Plaintiff on short notice, or delegating care to a third party, has created instability, unpredictability, and stress for the Children, and has disrupted their sleep, schedules, and routines.

19. The Plaintiff has consistently made the Children available for the Defendant’s court-ordered parenting time and has taken them when the Defendant was unable or unwilling to exercise that time in order to ensure their safety and well-being.

20. The Plaintiff seeks not to reduce the Defendant’s meaningful relationship with the Children, but to adjust the overnight schedule to reflect his actual availability and capacity, to promote the Children’s safety, and to ensure that overnights occur only when a parent—not an unrelated adult roommate—is available and able to supervise them appropriately.

21. The foregoing changes in the Defendant’s work schedule, his resulting inability to personally care for the Children during many of his scheduled overnight parenting times, and the increased instability and safety concerns for the Children collectively constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the Existing Order.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

22. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination, including modification, is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10(a).

23. The Court “retains authority to modify custody arrangements when a material change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the child.” See, e.g., *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).

24. A custody or parenting-time judgment may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances, and (2) that modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226, 235–236 (2012); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366, 368–372 (1981) (modification requires material change in circumstances); *Paternity of Cheryl*, 434 Mass. 23, 30–31 (2001).

25. The Defendant’s significant change in work schedule from daytime to overnight shifts, his corresponding inability to personally supervise the Children during many of his scheduled overnights, and his practice of delegating overnight care to a roommate not known to the Plaintiff or well known to the Children, directly impact the Children’s safety, stability, and routine.

26. Massachusetts courts recognize that changes in a parent’s work schedule and availability to care for a child can constitute a material change in circumstances justifying modification when those changes materially affect the child’s welfare. See *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998) (employment and scheduling issues may warrant modification where they affect care of child); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–405 (1981).

27. Decisions concerning primary physical custody and parenting time should promote stability, continuity, and adequate supervision for the child. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–844 (emphasizing stability and continuity); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 599 (1996) (courts weigh stability, parental fitness, and the child’s daily needs).

28. In evaluating the best interests of the Children, the Court must consider such factors as the children’s age, needs, and welfare; the capacity of each parent to provide personal care and supervision; the children’s routine and stability; and the willingness and ability of each parent to meet the children’s day-to-day needs. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–226 (1998); *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755, 769–770 (1983).

29. The Defendant’s current pattern—frequent last-minute cancellations of his overnights due to fatigue, and/or leaving the Children with his roommate when he is working or sleeping—does not provide consistent structure, supervision, or safety appropriate for minor children ages 8 and 6, particularly overnight.

30. The Children’s reports that they often sleep on the couch while the Defendant naps following his overnight shifts raise legitimate concerns regarding both the adequacy of supervision and the quality of the Children’s rest and nighttime routine.

31. The Plaintiff’s home is the Children’s primary residence, and she has consistently been available to provide overnight care, ensure a consistent bedtime, and maintain the Children’s school and activity routines.

32. A modification limiting the Defendant’s overnight parenting time to nights when he is actually off work and reasonably rested, and requiring that he personally supervise the Children (rather than delegating overnights to a roommate or third party), would promote the Children’s safety, well-being, and stability while preserving the Defendant’s relationship with them.

33. Massachusetts law recognizes that the Court may and should tailor parenting plans to the realities of each parent’s schedule and capacity to care for the children. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842–844; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. at 191–192.

34. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the changed circumstances and the Children’s best interests. It does not seek to terminate or unreasonably restrict the Defendant’s relationship with the Children, but rather to ensure that overnight parenting time occurs only when the Defendant is truly able to provide safe, awake, and direct care.

35. For these reasons, a modification of the Existing Order is necessary and appropriate under G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and applicable case law, including, without limitation, *M.C. v. T.K.*, *Schuler v. Schuler*, *Custody of Kali*, *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, *Rosenberg v. Merida*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Adoption of Hugo*, *Custody of a Minor*, *Paternity of Cheryl*, and *Rolde v. Rolde*.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

36. The Plaintiff does not seek to alter the parties’ joint legal custody, except to the extent necessary to implement a safe and practical parenting plan. The Plaintiff remains willing and able to share major decision-making regarding the Children with the Defendant.

37. The Plaintiff seeks to modify the Existing Order with respect to physical custody and parenting time so that:

   a. The Plaintiff continues as the primary physical custodian/residential parent for the Children.

   b. The Defendant’s parenting time is restructured so that overnights occur only on days/nights when the Defendant is not scheduled to work an overnight (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., or similar) shift within a reasonable period (for example, no overnight parenting time by the Defendant on any night before, during, or immediately following an overnight work shift).

   c. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with a written or electronic copy of his regular work schedule as soon as it is available, and promptly notify the Plaintiff of any changes in his schedule that may affect parenting time.

   d. Any midweek overnight parenting time shall be converted, as necessary, to a non-overnight visit if the Defendant is scheduled to work an overnight shift or is otherwise unable to personally supervise the Children, with pick-up and drop-off times to be reasonably agreed upon by the parties or, failing agreement, as ordered by the Court.

   e. The Defendant shall personally supervise the Children during his parenting time and shall not routinely delegate overnight care to a roommate or unrelated third party, except for brief, reasonable periods consistent with ordinary childcare arrangements (e.g., a babysitter for a few hours), and only if such arrangements are consistent with the Children’s safety and well-being.

   f. The parties shall adjust the Defendant’s weekend parenting time, as needed, to ensure that when the Children are with the Defendant overnight, he is not working, is awake, and is able to provide appropriate nighttime care and supervision.

   g. The Court may schedule periodic review and/or order the parties to exchange updated work schedules so that the parenting plan remains aligned with the Defendant’s actual availability.

38. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court make any additional orders necessary to protect the Children’s best interests, including but not limited to:

   a. Clarifying pick-up and drop-off times and locations;  
   b. Providing for notice requirements if either parent is unable to exercise scheduled parenting time; and  
   c. Such other conditions as the Court deems appropriate to ensure the Children’s safety, stability, and welfare.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and determine that, since the entry of the Existing Order dated May 15, 2020, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children, specifically including, but not limited to, the Defendant’s change to overnight shift work, his resulting inability to personally exercise many of his scheduled overnights, and the corresponding instability and safety concerns for the Children.

B. Find and determine that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary and appropriate in order to serve the best interests of the Children, in accordance with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 & 31; G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10 & 20; and applicable case law, including *M.C. v. T.K.*, *Schuler v. Schuler*, *Custody of Kali*, *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, *Rosenberg v. Merida*, *Custody of Vaughn*, *Adoption of Hugo*, *Custody of a Minor*, *Paternity of Cheryl*, and *Rolde v. Rolde*.

C. Modify the Existing Order to provide that:

   1. The Plaintiff remains the primary physical custodian of the Children.  
   2. The Defendant’s overnight parenting time is limited to nights when he is not scheduled to work an overnight shift, and when he is reasonably rested and able to provide direct supervision and care.  
   3. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with his work schedule and promptly notify her of any changes affecting his parenting time.  
   4. Any midweek overnight that conflicts with the Defendant’s overnight work schedule is converted to appropriate daytime/evening parenting time, without an overnight, at times to be set forth in the modified order.  
   5. The Defendant shall not routinely delegate overnight parenting time to a roommate or unrelated third party, except for brief, reasonable childcare arrangements consistent with the Children’s safety and best interests.  
   6. The Court shall establish a specific, workable parenting schedule consistent with the Defendant’s actual availability and the Children’s best interests.

D. Order such further and additional relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor Children.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
Samantha Johnson
