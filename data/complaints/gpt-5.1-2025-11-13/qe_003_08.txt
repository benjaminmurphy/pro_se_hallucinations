COMPLAINT  
(BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT – G.L. c. 186, § 14)

Plaintiff Sarah Johnson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Sarah Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Green Street, Studio Apartment, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and/or controls the residential premises located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Premises”), and is Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action between a landlord and tenant concerning residential premises located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court Department, and because the action arises out of the residential tenancy and the landlord‑tenant relationship.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3, 6, because the Premises are located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130, which lies within the jurisdiction of this Court, and because the causes of action asserted herein arise from events occurring at that address.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”).

6. The agreed monthly rent for the Apartment is $1,500, payable to Defendant.

7. Plaintiff has at all relevant times duly paid rent or has been ready, willing, and able to pay rent as required by the tenancy.

8. During Defendant’s pre‑rental showing of the Apartment, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the living area.

9. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the water stains and whether there had been a prior leak.

10. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the water stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed.”

11. Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s assurances that the leak had been completely repaired and that the water intrusion problem was resolved when she decided to rent the Apartment.

12. After Plaintiff moved into the Apartment, the first substantial rainstorm that occurred resulted in active water intrusion at or near the location of the prior water stains.

13. Water began dripping through the ceiling in the exact area where Plaintiff had observed the stains during the showing.

14. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the active leak and requested that Defendant properly repair the condition.

15. Over the ensuing months, Plaintiff complained to Defendant multiple times about the recurring leak and ongoing water intrusion during rainstorms.

16. Defendant repeatedly minimized and dismissed the problem, characterizing it as a “minor cosmetic issue.”

17. Defendant further told Plaintiff that she knew the Apartment had “character” when she signed the lease, implying that Plaintiff should accept the ongoing leak and damage.

18. Despite repeated notice, Defendant failed and refused to make timely and adequate repairs necessary to stop the water intrusion and to remediate resulting damage and conditions.

19. During one heavy rainstorm, the leak worsened to the point that water significantly intruded into the Apartment, soaking Plaintiff’s couch and other personal property.

20. During that storm, water from the leaking ceiling soaked the area around Plaintiff’s coffee table and ruined Plaintiff’s laptop, which was on the coffee table.

21. Plaintiff’s laptop was rendered inoperable and had to be replaced at a cost of approximately $900.

22. The recurring leak and chronic moisture have created a persistent musty odor in the Apartment.

23. Over time, Plaintiff has begun experiencing headaches and physical discomfort that she reasonably believes are related to dampness and possible mold growth resulting from the unrepaired leak.

24. Because of the water intrusion and the area of the Apartment affected by the leak, Plaintiff has been forced to rearrange and substantially limit her use of the Apartment.

25. Plaintiff has had to move her bed away from the leaking area and effectively is living in only approximately half of the Apartment, substantially interfering with her normal, intended, and quiet use and enjoyment of the Premises.

26. The condition of the Apartment, including but not limited to the persistent ceiling leak, water intrusion, water‑damaged furnishings, potential mold, and musty odor, materially impairs the character and value of the leased Premises.

27. The conditions described above have continued for a substantial period of time and have not been adequately remedied by Defendant despite repeated notice and opportunity to repair.

28. Defendant’s failure and refusal to fix the leak and remediate the resulting damage is not a mere temporary inconvenience but a substantial and continuing interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy.

29. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for maintaining the roof, exterior, and structural elements of the building and for making necessary repairs to prevent water intrusion into the Apartment.

30. At all relevant times, Plaintiff had done nothing to cause or contribute to the ceiling leak or water intrusion and used the Apartment in a reasonable manner.

31. The continuing leak and its consequences have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to occupy and quietly enjoy the Apartment as a residential dwelling.

32. Defendant, having been explicitly notified by Plaintiff of the ceiling leak and its escalating consequences, knowingly and repeatedly failed to take appropriate corrective action.

33. Defendant’s conduct, in failing to take reasonable steps to correct the condition and in dismissing Plaintiff’s complaints as merely “cosmetic,” constitutes an intentional, willful, and/or reckless interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

34. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Damage to personal property, including the destruction of her laptop, valued at approximately $900;  

   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Apartment;  

   c. Discomfort, inconvenience, and distress associated with living in a damp, musty, and potentially unhealthy environment; and  

   d. Payment of full rent for premises that were materially impaired in character and value.

35. Based on these harms, Plaintiff seeks damages of at least $900 and such additional amounts as may be determined at trial, including but not limited to statutory multiples of her actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as provided by law.

### IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

36. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, which protects a tenant from serious interference with her tenancy by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s control.

37. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so “shall also be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

38. Massachusetts appellate courts have held that a landlord’s failure to correct substantial conditions that interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises, when the landlord knows of those conditions, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:

   a. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where his actions or inaction created a condition substantially interfering with tenants’ occupancy);  

   b. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord’s repeated failure to correct water leaks and defects, after notice, supported a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment and warranted statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14);  

   c. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (chronic flooding problems, unremedied by landlord despite notice, constituted substantial interference with tenant’s quiet enjoyment and justified substantial damages);  

   d. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment statute protects tenants from serious interferences attributable to landlord’s conduct or failure to act);  

   e. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (landlord’s failure to make necessary repairs after notice can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment under § 14);  

   f. *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994) (discussing scope of tenant protections and landlord’s obligations in residential tenancies);  

   g. *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 368 Mass. 595 (1975) (recognizing modern tenant protections and the landlord’s obligation to provide habitable premises);  

   h. *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (conditions that materially impair the character and value of leased premises may warrant remedies for tenants);  

   i. *Moscovitz v. Ward*, 11 Mass. App. Ct. 1030 (1981) (breach of quiet enjoyment found where landlord’s failure to act after notice allowed serious conditions to persist);  

   j. *Snyder v. Ward*, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 1048 (1982) (statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 available where landlord’s conduct substantially interferes with tenant’s use).

39. In *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s failure to correct chronic flooding and sewer backups, after notice, was sufficient to establish a breach of quiet enjoyment, even absent an intent to harass, because the landlord’s inaction resulted in a serious interference with the tenant’s tenancy.

40. Similarly, in *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52, the Court held that a landlord’s repeated failure to adequately repair leaky ceilings and water damage, causing continuing problems for the tenant, supported a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment and the award of statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” as well as costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee. See also *Cruz Mgmt. Co.*, 417 Mass. at 788; *Al‑Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 852.

42. While separate and distinct from the implied warranty of habitability recognized in *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 368 Mass. 595 (1975), the covenant of quiet enjoyment often overlaps with serious repair and water intrusion issues that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use of the premises. See also *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (earlier related decision addressing landlord‑tenant obligations).

43. Persistent water leaks, water damage, and conditions conducive to mold growth have repeatedly been held to be serious interferences with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of rental premises and may support liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 when unremedied by the landlord after notice. See, e.g., *Simon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03; *Al‑Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–52; *Moscovitz*, 11 Mass. App. Ct. at 1030.

44. Defendant’s knowledge of the leak (both prior to and after the commencement of the tenancy), his representations that it had been “totally fixed,” and his subsequent refusal to adequately address the ongoing water intrusion and resulting conditions bring this case squarely within the protections provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the above‑cited cases.

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  

**COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

45. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 44 as if fully set forth herein.

46. At all relevant times, Plaintiff, as a residential tenant, was entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the Premises, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, and as implied in her tenancy with Defendant.

47. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, had a statutory and contractual duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

48. The chronic and recurring ceiling leak, water intrusion, and related conditions in the Apartment, as described above, constitute serious and substantial interferences with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

49. Defendant had actual notice of the ongoing leak and water intrusion problems both before and throughout the tenancy, including after multiple complaints by Plaintiff.

50. Despite notice and reasonable opportunity to cure, Defendant failed and refused to make adequate and timely repairs to stop the leak and to remediate the resulting damage and conditions.

51. Defendant’s dismissive response—characterizing the leak as a “minor cosmetic issue” and stating that Plaintiff knew the Apartment had “character”—demonstrates a knowing and intentional disregard of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.

52. Defendant’s conduct, including his failure to take reasonable steps to remedy the leak and its consequences, directly and foreseeably caused the water damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including the destruction of her laptop, as well as substantial disruption to her use of the Apartment.

53. Defendant’s actions and omissions, taken as a whole, constitute a direct and/or indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, and the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in the tenancy.

54. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss and damage to personal property, including a $900 laptop;  

   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Apartment due to water intrusion and related conditions;  

   c. Discomfort, inconvenience, and distress associated with living in a damp, musty, and potentially unhealthy environment; and  

   d. Payment of full rent during periods when the character and value of the Premises were materially impaired by ongoing water intrusion and related problems.

55. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater. At a monthly rent of $1,500, three months’ rent equals $4,500.

56. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the cases interpreting it, including *Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997), *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), and *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), Plaintiff is also entitled to recover her costs of this action and a reasonable attorney’s fee. To the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel, such fees should be awarded consistent with the statute.

57. Plaintiff expressly reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence and to adjust her demand for damages consistent with proof at trial and with the statutory remedies provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Sarah Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of actual and consequential damages suffered by Plaintiff as a result of Defendant’s breach, including but not limited to:

   1. Compensation for damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including the destroyed laptop valued at approximately $900; and  

   2. Compensation for loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, discomfort, inconvenience, and other harms resulting from the persistent water intrusion and related conditions;

C. Statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than the greater of Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent (at least $4,500), as determined by the Court;

D. An award of costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs;

E. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff retains counsel, in an amount to be determined by the Court;
