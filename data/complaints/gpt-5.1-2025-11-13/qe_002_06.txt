------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Moore (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Linda Johnson (“Defendant” or “Landlord”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Moore is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.

2. Defendant Linda Johnson is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Housing Court Department, City of Boston Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, which grants the Housing Court jurisdiction over actions involving “the health, safety or welfare of any occupant of residential housing” and arising out of the landlord‑tenant relationship.

4. Venue is proper in this Court because the Premises are located in Roxbury, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2; G.L. c. 185C, § 3.

5. The amount in controversy is approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00), exclusive of statutory multiple damages, attorney’s fees (if any are later incurred), and costs, all within this Court’s jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the basement unit located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Unit” or “Apartment”), owned and managed by Defendant.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Unit as her home since on or about March 1, 2022, and pays rent to Defendant in the amount of $1,200.00 per month.

8. Plaintiff’s tenancy is governed by Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and by the implied warranty of habitability and statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); G.L. c. 186, § 14.

9. In or about October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying that month’s rent due to unexpected medical bills, but she paid the full rent and the late fee assessed by Defendant. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has ultimately paid all rent due.

10. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff discovered that water was seeping in through an exterior basement wall of the Unit during and after heavy rainstorms.

11. The water infiltration occurred repeatedly and caused standing water, dampness, and moisture intrusion along at least one wall of the basement Unit.

12. The water penetration and damp conditions caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including but not limited to a rug and a bookshelf placed against the affected wall, with an estimated value of approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00).

13. The damp and wet conditions also required Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier nearly continuously to attempt to dry the Unit, increasing Plaintiff’s electric costs.

14. The presence of repeated water infiltration, dampness, and excess moisture in a basement dwelling unit is a condition that endangers or materially impairs the health, safety, or well‑being of occupants and constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; particularly 105 C.M.R. 410.200 (requiring moisture‑resistant, weathertight building elements) and 105 C.M.R. 410.750 (conditions deemed to endanger or materially impair health or safety).

15. In November 2025, shortly after observing the water problem, Plaintiff notified Defendant by text message of the water seepage and requested that Defendant repair the condition.

16. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” thereby acknowledging notice of the condition, but did not promptly or effectively correct the water infiltration.

17. Over the following weeks, the water intrusion continued during heavy rains. Plaintiff’s property continued to be at risk of damage, and the Unit remained damp and unhealthy.

18. Because Defendant failed to remedy the condition, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department and requested an inspection of the Unit.

19. The City of Boston inspectors came to the Premises, inspected the Unit, and, upon information and belief, cited and/or noted the water intrusion and other violations of applicable housing or sanitary code provisions.

20. Defendant was thereby placed on written and official notice by municipal authorities of the existence of the water infiltration and related code issues in the Unit.

21. Despite notice from both Plaintiff and the City of Boston, Defendant failed and has continued to fail to correct the water infiltration and associated unsanitary and unsafe conditions in a timely, reasonable, and effective manner.

22. The water seepage and unremedied moisture condition has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, causing damage to property, anxiety about further damage, concern about potential mold, and the need for continuous operation of a dehumidifier.

23. After Plaintiff contacted the City and the inspection occurred, Defendant began to characterize Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

24. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that Defendant does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in or about March 2026 (Plaintiff’s lease next expiration date), allegedly due to the prior late rent payment.

25. The timing and context of Defendant’s decision not to renew, occurring shortly after Plaintiff exercised her legal rights to request code enforcement and inspections, are suspicious and retaliatory in nature, demonstrating hostility and ill will toward Plaintiff’s lawful efforts to secure habitable housing.

26. Defendant’s refusal to timely repair the water intrusion, and her negative treatment of Plaintiff after Plaintiff sought municipal assistance, have combined to create an atmosphere of substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

27. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has acted reasonably and in good faith in notifying Defendant about the water problem, cooperating with city inspectors, and attempting to protect her property and health.

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, Plaintiff has suffered:  
    a. Damage to personal property (rug and bookshelf) in the amount of approximately $400.00;  
    b. Increased electricity costs due to the need to run a dehumidifier nearly constantly;  
    c. Inconvenience, discomfort, and anxiety from living in a damp, water‑intruded basement unit and worrying about the condition and about retaliation; and  
    d. Substantial interference with her right to quietly and peacefully enjoy her home.

29. Plaintiff sues solely for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, and does not assert any other causes of action in this Complaint.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

30. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1–29 as if fully set forth herein.

31. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

32. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease or tenancy and protects tenants against serious interferences with their tenancy caused by the landlord or those acting under the landlord’s control. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708, 720 (2002).

33. A landlord’s failure to correct conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code after notice can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where such failure results in a serious interruption of the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises. Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–200; Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 760–61 (1979).

34. Persistent water intrusion, dampness, and unsanitary conditions that endanger or materially impair the health or safety of occupants are substantial interferences with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.; Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 199–201 (1979) (substantial interference where landlord allowed conditions that materially impaired health or safety); Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

35. Defendant had actual notice of the water infiltration, both through Plaintiff’s text messages and through the City of Boston inspection and resulting notice or citations.

36. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to make timely and reasonable repairs to stop the water intrusion and correct the unsanitary and hazardous conditions in Plaintiff’s basement Unit.

37. Defendant’s failure to respond adequately and promptly to these serious conditions, over a period of weeks and continuing through the date of this Complaint, constituted intentional or at least reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and of her health, safety, and well‑being.

38. The ongoing water infiltration and associated conditions substantially impaired the value of the leasehold to Plaintiff and significantly interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. See Wesson, 437 Mass. at 720; Darmetko, 378 Mass. at 760–61.

39. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s knowledge of dangerous or unhealthy conditions and failure to act can be treated as a “direct or indirect interference” with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment for purposes of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

40. The existence of code violations and water intrusion, plus Defendant’s refusal to take adequate corrective action after inspectional enforcement, constitutes a serious interruption of the tenancy that “materially impairs the character and value of the leased premises.” See Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199; Berman & Sons, 379 Mass. at 199–201.

41. In addition, Defendant’s hostility and labeling of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant,” and Defendant’s stated intention not to renew Plaintiff’s lease shortly after Plaintiff contacted the City, underscore Defendant’s disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and contribute to the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51 (landlord conduct that pressures or harasses tenant can amount to breach of quiet enjoyment).

42. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

43. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages include at least:  
    a. Approximately $400.00 for damaged personal property (rug and bookshelf);  
    b. Increased electric utility charges attributable to running a dehumidifier to combat the water intrusion; and  
    c. Non‑economic harm including loss of use and enjoyment of her home, inconvenience, emotional distress, and disruption caused by the hazardous and unsanitary condition of the Unit.

44. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200.00. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the greater of (a) her actual and consequential damages or (b) three months’ rent (3 × $1,200.00 = $3,600.00), plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if any).

45. Defendant’s acts and omissions described above directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s damages and constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### V. LEGAL AUTHORITIES (NON‑EXHAUSTIVE)

46. This Complaint relies on, among other authorities, the following statutes, regulations, and cases, all of which support Plaintiff’s claim of breach of quiet enjoyment:

   a. G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment; damages of actual/consequential or three months’ rent, whichever greater, plus costs and attorney’s fees).  
   b. G.L. c. 239, § 8A (recognizing remedies for code violations and landlord breaches in the landlord‑tenant context).  
   c. G.L. c. 185C, § 3 (jurisdiction of the Housing Court).  
   d. Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (implied warranty of habitability; relationship of code violations to tenant remedies and quiet enjoyment).  
   e. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord’s failure to correct serious water infiltration and sanitary code violations; breach of quiet enjoyment; emotional distress damages).  
   f. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (sanitary code violations and landlord inaction as breach of quiet enjoyment).  
   g. Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979) (sanitary code violations and landlord’s failure to maintain habitable conditions; tenant remedies).  
   h. Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord liability for interference with quiet enjoyment; significance of code violations and landlord conduct).  
   i. Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (scope of quiet enjoyment and landlord liability for interference with tenant’s beneficial use of premises).  
   j. Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708 (2002) (substantial interference standard and landlord liability for failure to maintain premises).  
   k. 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. (State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

These authorities, among others, establish that a landlord’s failure to remedy known conditions that endanger or materially impair a tenant’s health or safety constitutes an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment and warrants statutory damages.
