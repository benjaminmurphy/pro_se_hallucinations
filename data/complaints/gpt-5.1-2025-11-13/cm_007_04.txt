Docket No. ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Physical Custody / Parenting Time)  

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows in support of her Complaint for Modification of a prior custody judgment pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Court’s equitable powers:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson** (“Mother”), is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Mother is the biological parent of the minor child:

   - **Sophia Smith**, date of birth: __________ (age 12).

2. The Defendant, **Mark Smith** (“Father”), is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the other biological parent of the minor child, Sophia Smith.

3. This Court has **continuing jurisdiction** over custody, visitation, and parenting-time matters concerning Sophia Smith pursuant to:

   - G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of custody and visitation orders upon a material and substantial change in circumstances and in the best interests of the child);  
   - G.L. c. 208, § 28A (enforcement and modification of custody judgments);  
   - G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (modification of judgments regarding custody and visitation of children born outside of marriage, where applicable); and  
   - The Court’s **inherent equity jurisdiction** over the welfare of minor children. See *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

4. On or about **March 12, 2019**, this Court entered a **Judgment** (or Temporary/Final Order) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor child (“2019 Custody Judgment”).

5. Under the 2019 Custody Judgment, the parties were awarded **shared physical custody** (50/50) of Sophia, with a **week-on / week-off** schedule, alternating physical custody every seven days.

6. At the time the 2019 Custody Judgment was entered, both parents:

   a. Lived in relatively close proximity to one another; and  
   b. Were in reasonably good physical health and able to meet the physical, emotional, and developmental needs of the child under a week-on / week-off parenting schedule.

7. The 2019 Custody Judgment was based upon the circumstances then existing and the Court’s determination of the **best interests of the child** under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and related case law. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711–12 (1985) (best interests standard governs custody); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 265 (2001).

### II. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Custody Judgment, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** affecting the safety, well-being, and best interests of the minor child, which was not contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the prior order.

9. Specifically, since the entry of the 2019 Custody Judgment, Father has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** (hereinafter, the “Condition”).

10. Upon information and belief, Father’s Condition significantly affects his **mobility, balance, and physical functioning**, and has led to multiple **falls in the home** and increasing dependence on assistive devices, including, but not limited to, a wheelchair.

11. Upon information and belief, Father’s treating physician(s) have advised Father that he:

   a. Should avoid situations where there is a substantial risk of falling, particularly near **stairs**; and  
   b. Should **not be the sole physically responsible caregiver** for a minor child in situations where quick physical response may be required for the child’s safety or in emergency situations.

12. Notwithstanding these medical limitations and medical advice, Father has **insisted on maintaining the exact same 50/50 week-on / week-off physical custody schedule** that was in place before the onset and progression of his Condition.

13. During Father’s parenting time, he has, at times, **relied on the parties’ twelve-year-old daughter, Sophia**, to assist him with tasks that are adult caregiving responsibilities, including but not limited to:

   a. Helping Father transfer from his wheelchair to his bed or other furniture;  
   b. Bringing Father necessary items such as medication, food, or mobility aids because he is unable to safely or promptly retrieve them himself; and  
   c. Assisting Father in physical tasks that, given her age, place inappropriate emotional and physical burdens upon her.

14. These caregiving responsibilities are **developmentally inappropriate** for a twelve-year-old child and risk:

   a. Exposing Sophia to **trauma and anxiety** regarding Father’s health and physical safety;  
   b. Creating an unhealthy **role reversal**, in which the child acts as caregiver to the parent; and  
   c. Placing Sophia at risk of **physical injury**, particularly in any situation involving lifting, supporting, or physically stabilizing Father.

15. Father’s Condition and related limitations also raise **safety concerns** for Sophia in situations where:

   a. Quick physical response may be necessary (e.g., if the child were to fall, choke, or otherwise be in danger);  
   b. Emergency evacuation or rapid movement is needed (e.g., due to a fire, medical emergency, or other urgent situation); or  
   c. The home environment includes hazards such as stairs, cluttered pathways, or other obstacles that could exacerbate Father’s mobility difficulties and impede his ability to supervise and protect the child.

16. The **progressive** nature of Father’s Condition means that his functional limitations are reasonably expected to **worsen over time**, further diminishing his ability to independently and safely provide primary physical care for Sophia on a week-on / week-off basis.

17. This **substantial change in Father’s health and functional capacity** is a material change in circumstances that directly affects the child’s welfare and was **not anticipated** at the time of the 2019 Custody Judgment.

18. Under Massachusetts law, a custody or parenting-time order may be modified when there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** and modification is necessary in the **best interests of the child**. See:

   - G.L. c. 208, § 28;  
   - *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619, 624–25 (2000) (modification requires a material and substantial change in circumstances plus a showing that modification is in the child’s best interests);  
   - *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 546–47 (2010) (affirming modification standards and focus on best interests of the child);  
   - *Pearson v. Pearson*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 159–60 (2001) (changed circumstances permitting modification of custody where child’s welfare significantly affected).

19. Father’s deteriorating health and resulting limitations, together with his insistence on continuing the prior **unchanged 50/50 schedule**, constitute a **material and substantial change** under the above authorities and justify a reexamination and modification of the custody and parenting-time provisions of the 2019 Custody Judgment.

### III. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

20. The paramount consideration in any modification of custody or parenting time is the **best interests of the child**. G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003).

21. In determining best interests, the Court considers, among other things:

   a. The child’s **safety and physical welfare**;  
   b. The child’s **emotional and psychological well-being**;  
   c. The child’s **developmental needs**;  
   d. The child’s relationships with each parent; and  
   e. The stability and predictability of the child’s living arrangements. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

22. At the time of the 2019 Custody Judgment, both parties were physically capable of fully parenting the child during their respective weeks without requiring the child to assume caregiver duties, and the week-on / week-off schedule functioned effectively for several years.

23. In light of Father’s Condition, his current physical limitations, and the associated safety and emotional concerns, the existing **equal physical custody arrangement no longer adequately protects Sophia’s best interests.**

24. Under the present circumstances:

   a. Sophia is occasionally placed in a position where she feels **responsible for Father’s physical safety**, which is inappropriate and emotionally burdensome given her age;  
   b. There is an increased risk of **accidental injury** to either Father or Sophia due to falls or failed transfers; and  
   c. Father’s ability to respond promptly and effectively in emergencies is **reduced**, potentially compromising Sophia’s safety.

25. While Father’s relationship with Sophia is important and should be **preserved and supported**, the schedule and nature of parenting time must be tailored to:

   a. Reflect Father’s **current medical and physical capacity**; and  
   b. Ensure that Sophia is not placed in a **quasi-caregiver role** or in unsafe physical situations.

26. Massachusetts appellate courts recognize that when a significant change in a parent’s circumstances undermines the child’s safety or welfare, a **reallocation of physical custody** to the more capable parent is appropriate. See, e.g.:

   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184–85 (2006) (modification warranted where existing arrangement no longer serves child’s best interests);  
   - *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900–01 (1981) (material change in circumstances including parental condition can justify modification);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 403–04 (1981) (child’s welfare is controlling consideration; change in circumstances supports modification).

27. A **primary physical custody arrangement with Mother**, together with **liberal and safe parenting time for Father**, will better safeguard:

   a. Sophia’s **physical safety**;  
   b. Sophia’s **emotional security and development**; and  
   c. The stability and predictability of Sophia’s day-to-day routines.

28. Mother is presently physically capable and willing to assume **primary physical care** of Sophia and to facilitate and encourage Sophia’s continued **meaningful relationship** with Father, consistent with Father’s medical limitations and the child’s safety.

29. Modifying the custody order to give Mother **primary physical custody** with an appropriate parenting-time schedule for Father, potentially including:

   a. Shorter and/or **daytime-only visits** at first,  
   b. Supervision or third-party assistance where appropriate, and  
   c. Adjustments to avoid dangerous environments (e.g., stairs, non-accessible settings),

   would be consistent with the best-interests standard and appropriately balance the child’s safety with the maintenance of a strong parent-child relationship with Father.

30. The requested modification is not sought for any improper purpose, but solely to protect and advance **Sophia’s best interests** as mandated by Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 841; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. at 545–47.

### IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION

31. G.L. c. 208, § 28 provides that the Court may, upon a complaint after a former decree, **revise and alter judgments relative to the care, custody, and maintenance of minor children** as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children require.

32. Under *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619, 624–25 (2000), and subsequent decisions, modification is appropriate when:

   a. There has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since entry of the prior judgment; and  
   b. The proposed modification is in the **best interests of the child**.

33. Father’s progressive neurological Condition, his diminished ability to independently care for the child safely, and the resulting impact on the child’s daily life and safety constitute a **material and substantial change** within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law. See *Pearson v. Pearson*, 52 Mass. App. Ct. at 159–60; *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 900–01.

34. The child’s best interests, as articulated in G.L. c. 208, § 31 and cases such as *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96, and *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. at 225–26, are no longer adequately served by the existing equal week-on / week-off custody arrangement in light of the changed circumstances.

35. The Court has broad discretion, under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31 and cases including *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 184–85, to:

   a. Reallocate **physical custody**;  
   b. Establish an **adjusted parenting-time schedule** that accounts for a parent’s health limitations; and  
   c. Impose conditions or safeguards as needed to protect the child’s safety and welfare.

36. To the extent the original judgment may have arisen in a non-marital context, the same standards apply under G.L. c. 209C, § 20, which authorizes modification of judgments concerning custody and visitation of children born to parents who are not married to each other, upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the **best interests of the child**. See *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 872–73 (2006).

37. Pursuant to these statutes and controlling decisions, Mother is entitled to a modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions of the 2019 Custody Judgment to reflect the current realities of Father’s health and the child’s needs.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION AND RELIEF

38. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the 2019 Custody Judgment, and that a modification is necessary to serve the **best interests of the minor child**, Sophia Smith.

39. Mother specifically requests that the Court:

   a. Award **Emily Johnson primary physical custody** of the minor child, Sophia Smith;  

   b. Confirm that the parties shall continue to share **legal custody** of the child, unless the Court determines that Sophia’s best interests require otherwise;  

   c. Establish a revised parenting-time schedule for **Mark Smith** that:

      i. Ensures Sophia’s **physical safety** and does not require her to act as a caregiver for Father;  
      ii. Takes into account Father’s **medical limitations** and the advice of his treating physicians regarding activities and environments that may place him or Sophia at risk;  
      iii. May initially provide for **shorter, structured, and, if appropriate, daytime-only parenting time**, with transitions and locations that are safe and accessible; and  
      iv. May be adjusted, expanded, or further modified by agreement of the parties or by future order of the Court as Father’s condition and Sophia’s needs evolve;  

   d. Include any necessary **conditions or safeguards** the Court deems appropriate to protect the child’s emotional and physical well-being, including but not limited to:

      i. Prohibiting Father from relying on the child for physical transfers or assistance that could reasonably risk injury to either Father or the child;  
      ii. Requiring that, when Father’s physical condition requires, another competent adult be present during Father’s parenting time to assist with tasks that Father cannot safely perform alone;  

   e. Grant such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper to protect the **best interests of the child**, including but not limited to orders under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and, where applicable, G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. **Find** that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the March 12, 2019 Custody Judgment, based upon Mark Smith’s progressive neurological Condition and its impact on his ability to safely exercise equal physical custody of Sophia Smith;

2. **Determine** that the existing week-on / week-off 50/50 shared physical custody arrangement is **no longer in the best interests** of the minor child, Sophia Smith;

3. **Modify** the prior custody and parenting-time provisions of the 2019 Custody Judgment to award **primary physical custody** of Sophia Smith to Emily Johnson;

4. **Establish** an appropriate, safe, and child-focused parenting-time schedule for Mark Smith that preserves and supports his relationship with Sophia while fully protecting Sophia’s physical safety and emotional well-being, taking into account Father’s medical limitations;

5. **Order** any safeguards or conditions deemed necessary to prevent the child from assuming inappropriate caregiver responsibilities and to avoid reasonably foreseeable risks of physical injury or emotional harm;

6. **Grant** such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and consistent with the **best interests of the child**.

Respectfully submitted,
