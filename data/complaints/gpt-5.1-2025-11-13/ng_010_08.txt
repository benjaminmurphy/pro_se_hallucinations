ROBERT THOMPSON,

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  
------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Johnson”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Robert Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), and alleges as follows:

                                   I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She regularly walks on the public sidewalk along Maple Street in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Robert Thompson is an individual residing at, and the owner and/or person in control and possession of the residential real property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts 01201 (the “Property”).

3. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, controlled, maintained, and/or was responsible for the trees and other conditions located on the Property, including a large maple tree whose branches extended over the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street.

                     II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injuries arising out of Defendant’s negligence under Massachusetts common law.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, such that the Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4.

6. All of the events and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Venue is proper in the Berkshire Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and 9 because the cause of action arose here and Defendant resides and/or has his usual place of abode here.

                          III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. At all times relevant, Defendant owned and controlled a large, old maple tree located on or immediately adjacent to the Property at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

8. A significant limb or branch of that maple tree extended over the public sidewalk abutting Defendant’s Property.

9. For a substantial period of time prior to August 15, 2023, the limb in question showed visible signs of defect, including a long, apparent crack and a drooping or sagging appearance over the sidewalk.

10. The cracked and drooping condition of the limb was open and obvious to pedestrians using the sidewalk, including Plaintiff, and to neighbors on Maple Street.

11. On multiple occasions prior to August 15, 2023, at least one or more neighbors and/or nearby residents informed Defendant that the limb appeared cracked, unsafe, and hazardous, and advised Defendant to have the tree inspected and/or pruned by a qualified arborist.

12. Upon information and belief, when neighbors raised concerns about the cracked tree limb, Defendant responded, in substance, that he would “deal with it in the spring,” or words to that effect.

13. Despite these notices and warnings, Defendant failed to have the tree or the defective limb evaluated, repaired, pruned, or otherwise made safe within a reasonable time, and the limb remained cracked and drooping over the sidewalk for an extended period.

14. On August 15, 2023, at approximately midday, Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, returning from a grocery trip and carrying grocery bags.

15. At the time, there was a typical summer thunderstorm with rain, wind, and thunder, but there were no tornado warnings, hurricane conditions, or extraordinary or unforeseeable weather phenomena. The weather was within the range of conditions reasonably anticipated for a Massachusetts summer storm.

16. While Plaintiff was walking past Defendant’s Property on the sidewalk, the previously cracked and drooping tree limb suddenly snapped and fell from the maple tree.

17. The falling limb struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground on the sidewalk.

18. As a direct and proximate result of being struck and knocked down, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, including painful injuries to her shoulder, back, and other parts of her body.

19. Plaintiff required medical treatment for these injuries, including evaluation, diagnostic services, and follow-up care.

20. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500.00 in medical expenses reasonably and necessarily related to the injuries caused by the falling limb.

21. Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week from her retail job as a direct result of her injuries, and she lost approximately $500.00 in wages.

22. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, pain, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the injuries sustained on August 15, 2023.

23. At all relevant times, Plaintiff exercised due care for her own safety while walking on the public sidewalk and had no reason to expect that a large tree limb would fall upon her in normal summer weather conditions.

24. The dangerous condition of the defective tree limb existed for a sufficient period of time, and with sufficient visible warning signs, that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care as a landowner, knew or reasonably should have known of the hazard and taken steps to remedy it.

25. Defendant failed to do so, and instead allowed the defective limb to remain overhanging the public sidewalk, creating an unreasonable risk of harm to foreseeable pedestrians such as Plaintiff.

26. Defendant’s failure to inspect, maintain, and remedy the hazardous tree limb was a substantial contributing cause of the limb’s failure and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries, losses, and damages.

                          IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                               (Negligence)

27. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1–26 as if fully set forth herein.

Duty

28. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors with respect to the condition of the land, including conditions created by trees and vegetation on or emanating from the property. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (establishing a general duty of reasonable care owed by landowners); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (landowners must act reasonably to protect lawful visitors from foreseeable hazards on their property).

29. Defendant, as owner and person in control of the Property and the maple tree in question, owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to inspect, maintain, and control the tree and its limbs so as not to create an unreasonable risk of harm to persons lawfully using the adjacent public sidewalk. See Williams v. G & C Gemini, Inc., 469 Mass. 640 (2014) (duty of reasonable care regarding conditions abutting premises that pose foreseeable risk to lawful users).

30. Massachusetts courts have consistently recognized that landowners must take reasonable steps to protect foreseeable persons from defects or hazards of which they know or reasonably should know, including naturally occurring conditions, when a failure to act may cause injury. See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148 (2013); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995).

31. Defendant further owed a duty to act reasonably once placed on notice—actual or constructive—of the defective condition of the tree limb. See Black v. Coastal Oil New England, Inc., 45 Mass. App. Ct. 461 (1998) (liability where defendant had actual or constructive notice of hazardous condition); Thurlow v. Crossman, 336 Mass. 248 (1957) (duty to correct or warn of dangerous conditions known to landowner).

Breach

32. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care owed to Plaintiff and other lawful users of the sidewalk by failing to reasonably inspect, maintain, or repair the visibly cracked and drooping limb extending over the public sidewalk.

33. Defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that the limb was cracked, unstable, and posed a foreseeable risk of falling, particularly during ordinary weather events, and that it was likely to cause serious injury if it fell on a pedestrian.

34. Defendant had actual notice of the hazard because neighbors and/or others specifically brought the defective condition of the limb to his attention and recommended that he consult an arborist and remedy the condition.

35. Despite this knowledge, Defendant failed to take any reasonable remedial measures, including but not limited to: (a) having the tree inspected by a competent professional; (b) pruning or removing the hazardous limb; (c) removing or securing the tree; or (d) warning pedestrians or restricting access under the limb.

36. A reasonable landowner, in Defendant’s position, who had been told about a cracked and drooping limb overhanging a public sidewalk, would have recognized the risk of harm and taken timely steps to prevent injury.

37. Defendant’s inaction and failure to remedy the hazardous condition violated his duty under Massachusetts common law negligence principles requiring the exercise of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm. See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm arising from conditions under one’s control); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000) (duty of care regarding conditions on property).

Causation

38. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.

39. But for Defendant’s failure to inspect and remedy the defective tree limb after being placed on notice of its dangerous condition, the limb would not have remained overhanging the sidewalk in a weakened and cracked state on August 15, 2023, and it would not have fallen on Plaintiff.

40. The risk that a visibly cracked and drooping limb over a public sidewalk could fall and injure a pedestrian, particularly in the course of a routine summer thunderstorm, was a foreseeable and natural consequence of Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care.

41. The injuries sustained by Plaintiff were the type of harm that reasonable care in inspecting and maintaining the tree limb was intended to prevent. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (foreseeability and proximate cause principles in negligence).

42. The weather conditions on August 15, 2023, constituted a relatively normal summer thunderstorm for Massachusetts and did not amount to an unforeseeable “Act of God” or extraordinary natural event that would break the chain of causation or relieve Defendant of his duty. See Pomeroy v. Westfield, 268 Mass. 552 (1929) (foreseeable natural conditions do not necessarily constitute an act of God when negligence contributes to injury).

Damages

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries, including a shoulder strain and multiple bruises.

44. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $2,500.00 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for treatment related to her injuries and may incur additional expenses in the future.

45. Plaintiff lost approximately $500.00 in wages when she was unable to work for about one week at her retail job due to the injuries caused by the falling limb.

46. Plaintiff has experienced, and continues to experience, physical pain, soreness, and discomfort as a consequence of the injuries sustained.

47. Plaintiff has suffered mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life associated with her injuries, medical treatment, and limitations on her usual activities.

48. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged contributory negligence of Plaintiff, which Plaintiff denies, does not bar recovery but at most may proportionally diminish damages; Plaintiff avers that she exercised reasonable care and that any causal negligence rests solely with Defendant.

49. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages proximately caused by his negligence, including medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other general and special damages. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 85; Mathis v. Massachusetts Elec. Co., 409 Mass. 256 (1991) (damages principles in negligence cases).

50. Plaintiff also seeks prejudgment interest on her damages at the statutory rate from the date of commencement of this action, as allowed by G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

                              V. JURY DEMAND

51. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

                         VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Robert Thompson, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the jury, but believed to be well in excess of $50,000, for:

   1. Past and future medical expenses associated with treatment of Plaintiff’s injuries;  
   2. Past and future lost wages and/or diminished earning capacity;  
   3. Past and future physical pain and suffering; and  
   4. Past and future emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life;

B. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

C. Costs of this action, as permitted by law;

D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

                                           Respectfully submitted,  
                                           Plaintiff,
