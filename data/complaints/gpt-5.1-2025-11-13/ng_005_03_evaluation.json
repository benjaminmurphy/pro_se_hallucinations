While the court does reference common-law property damage principles to interpret \u00a7 5, it ultimately disallows the claimed property damages and notes that no evidence of consequential losses such as lost rental value was offered. The case therefore does not affirmatively establish that Massachusetts law permits recovery of consequential economic loss for property damage caused by negligence; it is a statutory environmental contamination decision and not a negligence damages precedent.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAt common law, the measure of damages to real property is dependent upon whether \u2018the injury is permanent\u2019 or \u2018reasonably curable by repairs.\u2019 \u2026 When the injury is permanent, the appropriate measure of damages is diminution of value \u2026 When the injury is temporary, that is, \u2018reasonably curable by repairs, the expense of repairs, if less than the diminished market value, is the measure of recovery.\u2019 \u2026 Our interpretation reserves to \u00a7 5 not only actions for permanent injury but also actions for the incidents of cleanup such as related restoration and repair work and lost rental value suffered during the cleanup and repair period.\u201d"

While the case focuses on structural restoration costs for special-purpose property rather than listing \u201cconsequential expenses\u201d in detail, its reasoning and approval of \u201creplacement or restoration costs\u201d and \u201cexpenditures to restore or to replace to predamage condition\u201d as damages necessarily encompasses reasonably necessary and foreseeable consequential repair-related costs. Thus it supports the proposition under Massachusetts law for property damage negligence actions, especially where market value is not an adequate measure.",

Not only must the cost of replacement or reconstruction be reasonable, the replacement or reconstruction itself must be reasonably necessary in light of the damage inflicted by a particular defendant\u2026.
