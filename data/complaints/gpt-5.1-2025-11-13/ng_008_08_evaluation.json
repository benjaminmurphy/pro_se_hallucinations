      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely discusses Massachusetts\u2019 comparative negligence statute and explains that in negligence actions a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence only bars recovery if it is greater than the negligence of the defendants and otherwise merely reduces damages proportionally. The court contrasts this with the absolute bar that applies in warranty under Correia, making clear that under G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, negligence up to and including 50% does not bar recovery but diminishes it. That matches the proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn a negligence case, the conduct of the plaintiff which will serve to bar recovery is governed by statute. Our comparative negligence statute provides that the plaintiff's contributory negligence shall not bar recovery if the plaintiff's negligence was not greater than the total amount of negligence attributable to the parties against whom recovery is sought. The plaintiff's negligence, if less than the amount attributable to the defendant or defendants, only serves to diminish recovery by the proportion of negligence attributable to the plaintiff.
