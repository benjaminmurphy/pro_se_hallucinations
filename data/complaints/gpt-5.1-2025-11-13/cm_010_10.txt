LISA TAYLOR,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK TAYLOR,  
    Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor (“Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Mark Taylor (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is:  
   Phone: (617) 555‑0123  
   Email: psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Mark Taylor, is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:

   - Emily Taylor, date of birth: __________________ (age 10).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31; G.L. c. 215, § 3; and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions of G.L. c. 209B, because the prior custody and parenting orders were issued by this Court and the child has resided in Massachusetts for more than six months preceding the filing of this Complaint.

5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court because the prior Judgment/Order regarding custody and parenting time was entered in this Division, and the parties and minor child presently reside within this Court’s jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

6. On or about May 20, 2015, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) regarding custody and parenting time for the minor child, Emily Taylor (the “2015 Judgment”).

7. Under the 2015 Judgment, primary physical custody (primary residence) of Emily was awarded to Father, with Mother having limited parenting time consisting of weekend visits and one weeknight dinner per week.

8. The 2015 Judgment and the parenting schedule contained therein were based on the circumstances existing at that time, which included:

   a. Mother was enrolled in graduate school and had demanding and inflexible academic and clinical schedules;

   b. Mother resided in a very small studio apartment that was not suitable for frequent or extended overnights with a young child; and

   c. Mother’s work and school commitments significantly limited her availability to care for the child on a more frequent or regular basis.

9. The 2015 Judgment has remained in effect to date and has not previously been modified.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since the entry of the 2015 Judgment, there has been a substantial and material change in the parties’ and child’s circumstances, such that modification of the prior custody and parenting plan is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 458 Mass. 1 (2010).

11. Massachusetts law provides that a custody or parenting-time order may be modified upon a showing of (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710–11 (1985) (best interests paramount).

12. Since 2015, Mother has completed graduate school and is no longer subject to the demanding and inflexible schedule that formed a major basis for the 2015 Judgment.

13. Mother now has a stable, full‑time job with regular, predictable, “normal” hours that allow her to be consistently available before and after school, on evenings, and on weekends to care for Emily.

14. Mother’s improved employment situation has resulted in financial stability and allows her to provide for Emily’s daily needs, including food, clothing, medical care, and educational and extracurricular expenses.

15. Mother no longer lives in a studio apartment. She now resides in a two‑bedroom apartment where Emily has her own separate, dedicated bedroom and a safe, stable, and comfortable environment.

16. The living conditions and overall environment at Mother’s home are now fully appropriate for regular and frequent overnight parenting time, including school‑night overnights.

17. Emily is now ten (10) years old, significantly older than when the 2015 Judgment entered, and her developmental needs, social life, school responsibilities, and emotional capacities have changed markedly since age four. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003) (recognizing developmental changes and child’s evolving needs as relevant); *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406, 409–10 (1976).

18. Over the past several years, Mother and Emily have developed a strong, loving, and close relationship. Mother has consistently exercised her parenting time, maintained regular contact, and participated in Emily’s schooling, activities, and emotional life.

19. Emily’s therapist has indicated that Emily experiences distress and feelings of guilt when her time with Mother is brief and she must leave after short visits, and that Emily desires more frequent and longer periods of time, including overnights, with Mother.

20. Emily has expressed, in a manner appropriate for her age, that she wishes to spend more time with Mother and to have additional overnights in Mother’s home.

21. Emily has written a letter to the Court (or the Judge) stating that she wants more overnights with Mother, which reflects her reasoned and consistent preferences as a ten‑year‑old child. While a child’s preference is not controlling, Massachusetts law recognizes that a mature child’s stated wishes constitute a significant factor in determining best interests. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 599–600 (1996); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 227–28 (1998).

22. Mother’s circumstances that previously limited her parenting time—graduate school, lack of flexible schedule, and inadequate housing—have been completely resolved. The conditions upon which the earlier order was based no longer exist. See *Schuh v. Schuh*, 458 Mass. at 7–9 (change in parent’s work schedule and stability can constitute material change).

23. Mother is now able and willing to assume a significantly greater share of parenting responsibilities, including school‑night care, homework supervision, transportation to and from school and extracurricular activities, medical appointments, and daily routines.

24. Father has declined to engage in reasonable discussions regarding any adjustment or expansion of Mother’s parenting time, despite the substantial change in circumstances and Emily’s stated desire for more time with Mother.

25. Upon information and belief, Father becomes angry and upset when Emily raises the issue of wanting more time or overnights with Mother, which places Emily in an emotionally conflicted position and exacerbates her feelings of guilt and stress.

26. The continuation of a highly restrictive parenting schedule, originally tailored to Mother’s former limitations and Emily’s much younger age, no longer reflects Emily’s best interests, current developmental needs, or the parties’ present capacities.

27. For purposes of Massachusetts law, the totality of these changes—Mother’s completion of school, stable employment with regular hours, suitable housing with a bedroom for the child, the child’s older age and changed developmental needs, the strengthening of the mother‑child bond, Emily’s expressed desire for more time with Mother, and the emotional impact of the current schedule—constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2015 Judgment. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schuh v. Schuh*, supra; *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

28. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the rights and responsibilities of parents regarding custody and visitation are to be determined “in accordance with the best interests of the child.”

29. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that the “best interests of the child” standard is the “touchstone inquiry” in any custody or parenting‑time determination or modification. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–84; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 710–11; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 842.

30. The best‑interests analysis considers, among other things, the child’s age and developmental stage, the emotional ties between the child and each parent, each parent’s ability to meet the child’s needs, the stability and quality of the child’s environment in each home, the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community, and, where appropriate, the child’s preferences. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 599–600; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44; G.L. c. 208, § 31.

31. Emily enjoys a strong, loving, and secure relationship with Mother. Mother has shown consistent commitment to Emily’s emotional, educational, and physical well‑being, and has regularly utilized her limited parenting time to maintain and strengthen that bond.

32. Mother’s current home provides a safe, stable, and nurturing environment, with sufficient space and a dedicated bedroom for Emily, which supports a regular schedule of overnight parenting time.

33. An expanded and more balanced schedule of parenting time, including additional overnights with Mother, would promote Emily’s emotional security, reduce her reported feelings of guilt and conflict around leaving Mother after brief visits, and allow Emily to have a meaningful parent‑child relationship with both parents.

34. Greater involvement by Mother in Emily’s day‑to‑day life—such as homework assistance, school‑night routines, and weekday activities—will promote Emily’s academic success, emotional well‑being, and overall adjustment.

35. Allowing Emily to have a parenting schedule that is responsive to her age‑appropriate wishes and preferences supports her sense of being heard and respected, which itself is in her best interests. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 599–600.

36. The requested modification does not seek to diminish Father’s relationship with Emily, but rather to ensure that Emily has substantial, meaningful, and frequent contact with both parents in a way that reflects her current needs and the realities of the parents’ lives.

37. Maintaining the current, highly limited schedule, which was designed for a four‑year‑old child and a student‑parent living in a studio apartment, now undermines Emily’s emotional health and does not reflect her current best interests.

38. A modified parenting plan expanding Mother’s parenting time, and providing additional overnights with Mother, would better serve Emily’s best interests and is warranted under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31.

### VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF

39. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties ... as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.”

40. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, the Court is authorized to determine and, when appropriate, modify legal and physical custody and visitation arrangements based on the best interests of the child, taking into account all relevant factors.

41. Massachusetts case law provides that an existing custody or visitation order may be modified when: (a) there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the last judgment; and (b) modification is in the child’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. at 183–84; *Schuh v. Schuh*, 458 Mass. at 7–9; *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 900.

42. The facts set forth above demonstrate both elements: (1) a material change in the circumstances of Mother and the child since the 2015 Judgment, and (2) that the requested modification is in Emily’s best interests.

43. In determining custody and parenting-time issues, the Court has broad equitable powers to fashion orders necessary to protect the welfare of the child. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 710–11; *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. at 409–10.

44. The requested modification is reasonable, consistent with Massachusetts law, and narrowly tailored to address the specific changes in circumstances and the current best interests of Emily Taylor.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

45. Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2015 Judgment to provide for a significantly expanded parenting schedule with Mother, consistent with Emily’s best interests, including but not limited to:

   a. Regular, substantial weekend parenting time with Mother, including overnights;

   b. Additional weeknight parenting time, including school‑night overnights in Mother’s home;

   c. A parenting schedule that provides Emily with consistent, predictable time with Mother on both weekdays and weekends, during school terms and school vacations;

   d. Such further adjustments to holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time as the Court deems appropriate to ensure that Emily enjoys meaningful and substantial time with both parents.

46. Mother further requests that the Court, in its discretion, consider Emily’s age‑appropriate preferences regarding the schedule and any recommendations from Emily’s therapist to the extent permitted by law and consistent with Emily’s welfare. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 599–600; *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. at 227–28.

47. Mother does not, by this Complaint, seek to disrupt Emily’s schooling or community connections, but rather to expand Mother’s involvement in Emily’s daily life in a manner that supports stability, emotional security, and continuity of relationships.

48. To the extent necessary, Mother requests any related or incidental orders that may be required to implement the modified parenting schedule, including provisions regarding transportation, communication between the parties, and communication between each parent and the child, as the Court deems just and proper.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the May 20, 2015 Judgment regarding custody and parenting time of Emily Taylor;

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of Emily Taylor, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and applicable Massachusetts case law;

C. Modify the prior Judgment to expand Mother’s parenting time substantially, including additional overnights and weekday time, and to establish a parenting schedule that provides Emily with frequent, regular, and meaningful contact with Mother, as the Court deems to be in Emily’s best interests;

D. Allocate holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time in a manner that affords both parents meaningful time with Emily and that reflects her best interests;

E. Enter such further orders as may be necessary to implement and enforce the modified parenting plan, including but not limited to transportation arrangements and reasonable communication protocols;

F. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LISA TAYLOR,
