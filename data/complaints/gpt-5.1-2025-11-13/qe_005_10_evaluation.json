The discussion is about implied warranty of habitability and statutory defenses (e.g., G.L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A), not about a tenant who has remained current on rent and thereby becomes entitled to full protection of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. This section does not state or imply that timely rent payment and lease compliance are prerequisites to, or confer, special protection of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; instead, it addresses rent withholding and habitability standards.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThese are two actions of summary process under G. L. c. 239 against tenants who admittedly had failed to pay their rent for dwelling units for a number of months. In each action the landlord seeks to recover possession of the dwelling unit and also the unpaid rent. \u2026 The situation before us is that tenants who have admittedly withheld payment of rent for apartments which they continued to occupy despite alleged violations of the Code now take the position that by reason of the violations the landlord may neither evict them nor recover any rent from them.\u201d"
