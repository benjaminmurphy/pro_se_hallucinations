v.                                                  

MICHAEL THOMPSON,  
Defendant.

CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff, Jessica Hartman (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant, Michael Thompson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman is an individual residing at 45 Washington Avenue, Apartment ___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental property located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable Massachusetts landlord‑tenant statutes.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought in the Chelsea Division of the District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, as the Premises are located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

6. Venue is proper in this Court because the rental property that is the subject of this action is located in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred there. See G.L. c. 223, § 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Apartment” or “Rental Unit”).

8. Plaintiff rents the Apartment from Defendant for residential purposes and pays monthly rent of approximately One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,250.00) to Defendant.

9. Defendant, as landlord, retains control over the common areas of the building at 45 Washington Avenue, including the main entry door, hallways, basement, and shared access areas. See *King v. G & M Realty Corp.*, 373 Mass. 658, 660–61 (1977) (landlord retains control over common areas).

10. At all relevant times, the main entry door to the building at 45 Washington Avenue has had a broken or defective lock. Specifically, the door does not latch properly, such that it can be pushed open without the use of a key.

11. Because the lock does not latch properly, the main entry door routinely remains unlocked or can be opened by anyone from the street with minimal effort.

12. Approximately two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the main entry door lock was broken and that the door did not latch properly, creating a serious security risk for Plaintiff and other tenants.

13. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated that he would have the lock repaired but failed to do so.

14. Following Plaintiff’s initial complaint, Plaintiff reminded Defendant on at least two additional occasions that the main entry door lock remained broken and that the building was not secure.

15. Despite these multiple notices and the foreseeable risk of unauthorized entry, Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the lock in a timely manner.

16. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to maintain a properly functioning and secure entry door lock, an unknown person or persons entered the building without authorization approximately one month prior to the filing of this Complaint.

17. During that unauthorized entry, one or more intruders went through the tenants’ mail and packages left in the common hallway of the building.

18. Plaintiff had at least one package delivered to the building hallway that was stolen during this incident. The value of the stolen package was approximately One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120.00).

19. In addition to the theft of packages, Plaintiff has discovered evidence indicating that an unknown person or persons have been sleeping in the building’s basement, including signs of sleeping materials and personal items not belonging to any tenant.

20. The presence of unauthorized individuals in the basement and common areas has caused Plaintiff significant distress, fear for her personal safety, and concern for the security of her Apartment and possessions.

21. Because Defendant has not repaired the broken entry door lock and has not taken reasonable steps to secure the building despite actual notice of the security problem, Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses to protect herself and her property.

22. Specifically, Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera for her Apartment door and a higher-quality deadbolt lock, at a combined cost of approximately Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00).

23. Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns as “overreacting” and has indicated that the neighborhood is “safe,” despite the occurrence of theft and evidence of unauthorized persons using the building.

24. Defendant has not provided any reasonable alternative security measures and has not fixed the defective main entry door lock, leaving the building vulnerable to unauthorized entry.

25. Defendant’s failure to maintain the entry door lock in good repair and to provide reasonable security of the building’s common entryway has materially and adversely affected Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her Apartment.

26. The continuing condition of an unsecured main entry door, theft of mail and packages, and the presence of unauthorized intruders in the building’s basement and common areas have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

27. Plaintiff has experienced anxiety, loss of sense of safety in her home, and disruption of her normal use of the Apartment due to concern about intruders and theft.

28. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, including but not limited to the loss of the stolen package valued at approximately $120.00 and approximately $200.00 in expenditures for security measures.

29. In total, Plaintiff reasonably estimates her damages at no less than Three Hundred Twenty Dollars ($320.00), exclusive of any statutory multiple damages, court costs, or attorney’s fees that may be available under Massachusetts law.

30. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been current in her rent or otherwise ready, willing, and able to comply with her obligations as a tenant, and the conditions described above are not the result of any act or omission by Plaintiff.

31. Defendant has had actual and constructive notice of the defective entry door lock and the resulting security and safety problems for at least two months prior to this Complaint and has unreasonably failed to remedy those conditions.

32. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as described above, constitute an interference with Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment as implied in every residential lease and expressly protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

33. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 32 above as if fully set forth herein.

34. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, whether or not expressly stated in a written lease. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33, 36 (1929).

35. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

36. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants against serious interferences with their use and enjoyment of the leased premises caused by the landlord’s acts or omissions. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–04 (1982); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977).

37. A landlord’s failure to remedy defective or unsafe conditions in areas under the landlord’s control, after notice, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the conditions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–49 (2005).

38. Common entrances, hallways, stairways, and basements of multi-unit residential buildings are areas typically retained under the landlord’s control and for which the landlord owes duties of care and maintenance. See *King v. G & M Realty Corp.*, 373 Mass. 658, 660–61 (1977); see also G.L. c. 186, § 15.

39. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning lock on the building’s main entry door, despite repeated notice, caused or allowed unauthorized persons to enter the building, steal tenants’ mail and packages, and occupy the basement without permission.

40. The theft of Plaintiff’s package, the presence of unauthorized persons in the building, and the persistent inability to secure the building entrance are all direct and reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to act.

41. The conditions described above—an unsecured main entry door, intrusion by strangers, and theft of property—constitute a substantial and serious interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04 (repeated flooding and failure to remedy constitutes breach); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 715–18 (landlord liable where actions create or permit conditions substantially interfering with tenants’ enjoyment).

42. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to secure the building after repeated notice, and his dismissive characterization of Plaintiff’s safety concerns as “overreacting,” demonstrate an intentional, willful, or at least reckless indifference to the impact of those conditions on Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–51 (landlord’s repeated refusal to remedy, after notice, supports liability under § 14).

43. A landlord may be held liable for breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 where the landlord, or one under his control, fails to correct conditions that interfere with the tenant’s use of the premises, even when the immediate acts (such as theft or intrusion) are committed by third parties, if such interference is the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s failure to act. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 717–18; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 201–03 (1979).

44. Massachusetts courts have recognized that serious security and safety issues, including unlawful entry and threats to the tenant’s safety arising from a landlord’s failure to maintain common areas, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 277–79 (1994) (landlord’s failure to provide reasonable security measures may result in liability where foreseeable harm results); *Lipsitt v. Plaud*, 466 Mass. 240, 246–48 (2013) (recognizing scope of landlord duties and statutory protections for tenants).

45. Defendant has also violated his statutory duty not to interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the building in compliance with applicable safety and building standards, including those requiring that egress doors and means of egress be properly maintained and secured. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 143, § 3; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L (State Sanitary Code).

46. The State Sanitary Code, promulgated under G.L. c. 111, § 127A, requires landlords to maintain the dwelling in a condition fit for human habitation and free from conditions that may endanger or materially impair the health, safety, or well-being of occupants, including inadequate security of doors and common areas. See 105 C.M.R. 410.750, 410.351, and related provisions.

47. A violation of the State Sanitary Code may be evidence of a serious interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment and breach of the landlord’s obligations under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. at 201–03; *Crowell v. McCaffrey*, 377 Mass. 443, 451–52 (1979).

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages including, without limitation: (a) the value of her stolen package (approximately $120.00); (b) the cost of security measures reasonably undertaken to mitigate the security risk ($200.00); and (c) emotional distress and loss of use and enjoyment of her home.

49. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–05; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 851.

50. Three months’ rent for Plaintiff’s Apartment at $1,250.00 per month is Three Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($3,750.00).

51. Plaintiff reserves the right to seek the statutory minimum of three months’ rent under G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as any additional damages, costs, and attorney’s fees to which she may be entitled under law, but for purposes of this filing identifies her actual out-of-pocket damages as approximately $320.00 exclusive of statutory enhancements.
