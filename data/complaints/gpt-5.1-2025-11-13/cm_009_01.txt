JESSICA THOMPSON,  
 Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL DAVIS,  
 Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Davis (date of birth omitted here for privacy).

2. The Defendant, Michael Davis (“Father”), is an individual who currently resides on Cape Cod, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Sophie Davis.

3. The parties are subject to an existing custody and parenting time Judgment/Order of this Court, entered on May 15, 2019, in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court (the “2019 Judgment”).

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 6, and venue is proper in the Barnstable Probate and Family Court as the court that issued the 2019 Judgment.

5. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related Massachusetts case law, which authorize modification of custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.

### II. PRIOR ORDER

6. On May 15, 2019, this Court entered the 2019 Judgment, which, among other things:

   a. Awarded primary physical custody of the minor child, Sophie Davis, to Mother; and  

   b. Granted Father parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

7. At the time the 2019 Judgment was entered, both parties resided in the same town, and the minor child’s travel time between the parents’ residences and her school for the midweek overnight was minimal, approximately a five‑minute drive.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2019 Judgment, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances, specifically related to Father’s relocation and the practical impact of the existing midweek overnight schedule on the minor child.

9. Father has moved from the same town where the parties previously resided to Cape Cod, approximately ninety (90) miles away from Mother’s residence and the minor child’s school.

10. Notwithstanding this relocation, Father continues to insist on exercising the Wednesday midweek overnight as set forth in the 2019 Judgment.

11. As currently practiced, on Wednesdays Father picks the child up from school, drives her approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence on Cape Cod, and then awakens her at or about 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings to drive her approximately ninety (90) miles back to school.

12. The minor child, Sophie, is eight (8) years old and is of elementary school age, and the repeated long‑distance, very early morning travel on school days has caused her to be regularly tired and exhausted on Thursdays.

13. The child’s teacher has reported a noticeable drop in the child’s participation, alertness, and engagement in school on Thursdays, which Mother is informed and believes is directly related to the late‑night travel on Wednesdays and pre‑dawn commute on Thursday mornings.

14. The current midweek overnight schedule now requires the child to endure what are effectively “marathon drives” on a school night, which did not exist and could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the 2019 Judgment, when the parties resided in close proximity.

15. The current circumstances are materially different from those existing at the time of the 2019 Judgment, and these changes have a direct impact on the child’s rest, school performance, and overall well‑being.

16. The change in Father’s residence—substantially increasing travel time—and the resulting adverse effect on the child’s sleep and school functioning constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances within the meaning of Massachusetts law. See, e.g.:

   - G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of custody/parenting time upon showing of material and substantial change and best interests of the child);  
   - G.L. c. 208, § 31 (best interests of the child as the governing standard in custody determinations);  
   - G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (modification of custody and visitation orders for children born out of wedlock);  
   - G.L. c. 208, § 37 (authority to revise and alter prior orders regarding children);  
   - G.L. c. 208, § 31A (considerations related to the child’s welfare and stability).

17. Under Massachusetts law, a parenting plan that was appropriate when both parents lived in close proximity may become inappropriate and harmful to a child’s best interests once a parent relocates a significant distance away, thereby altering the day‑to‑day burdens of travel, school attendance, and continuity. See, e.g.:

   - **Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (recognizing the significance of relocation and its impact on existing custody/visitation orders);  
   - **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (relocation and custody decisions must remain grounded in the child’s best interests);  
   - **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015) (modification appropriate where changed circumstances affect child’s welfare).

18. Massachusetts appellate courts consistently hold that once a material and substantial change in circumstances is shown, the Court must then determine whether the requested modification is in the best interests of the child. See, e.g.:

   - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - **Custody of a Minor**, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 115 (1988);  
   - **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012);  
   - **Bouchard v. Bouchard**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript) (modification must advance the child’s welfare).

19. The adverse effects on the child’s rest, academic participation, and Thursday school functioning show that the continuation of the current midweek overnight is no longer in the child’s best interests. See:

   - **Murphy v. Murphy**, 380 Mass. 454 (1980) (best interests of the child are paramount in custody matters);  
   - **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (court must consider practical impact of schedule on children’s daily lives);  
   - **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006) (importance of stability and predictability in children’s routines).

20. The child’s need for adequate sleep, reasonable travel demands, and consistent school performance and engagement are core aspects of her physical, emotional, and educational well‑being, which Massachusetts courts recognize as central to the “best interests of the child” standard. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44.

21. The current Wednesday overnight arrangement, under present conditions, imposes unnecessary and avoidable stress and fatigue on the child and impairs her ability to participate fully in school on Thursdays.

22. Accordingly, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2019 Judgment, and the existing parenting time schedule, particularly the midweek overnight, is no longer in the minor child’s best interests and should be modified.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

23. In determining custody and parenting time, Massachusetts law requires that the Court consider the best interests of the child as the overarching guiding principle. G.L. c. 208, § 31; see also Murphy v. Murphy, 380 Mass. at 461–62; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595.

24. The existing midweek overnight arrangement requires the minor child to:

   a. Travel approximately ninety (90) miles to Father’s residence on Wednesday evenings after school; and  

   b. Awaken at roughly 4:30 a.m. on Thursday mornings for another approximately ninety (90) mile drive to school.

25. Such a schedule on a school night is disruptive to the child’s sleep schedule, causes chronic tiredness on Thursdays, and undermines her ability to fully participate and benefit from her education.

26. The child’s teacher has specifically observed and reported diminished participation and engagement on Thursdays, which Mother is informed and believes is directly linked to the excessive midweek travel and early morning wake‑ups.

27. Stability, routine, and adequate rest are critical to an eight‑year‑old child’s development and school success. See, e.g., Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44 (courts look to stability, continuity, and the child’s daily needs in assessing best interests).

28. The requested modification does not seek to eliminate Father’s relationship with the child or to unreasonably restrict his parenting time; rather, it seeks to adjust the schedule to remove a demonstrably harmful school‑night arrangement while preserving meaningful contact, primarily through weekend parenting time.

29. By eliminating the Wednesday midweek overnight during the school year and adjusting weekend parenting time, the child will:

   a. Gain more consistent and adequate sleep on school nights;  

   b. Avoid extremely early wake‑up times and long drives before school; and  

   c. Be better able to focus, participate, and succeed in school on Thursdays and generally.

30. This proposed modification promotes the child’s physical health, emotional stability, and academic success and therefore is in the child’s best interests within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 31 and controlling case law, including but not limited to Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44; and Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 900.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

31. Mother seeks a modification of the 2019 Judgment solely with respect to the parenting time schedule, so as to address the material change in circumstances stemming from Father’s relocation and the resulting impact on the child’s well‑being.

32. Specifically, Mother respectfully requests that the Court:

   a. Eliminate the existing Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time during the school year (or, if the Court prefers, during any periods when the child has school the next day);  

   b. Provide that Father may have reasonable weekday dinner‑only contact or virtual/telephone contact on a mutually agreeable weekday, without an overnight and without requiring excessive travel on a school night; and  

   c. Maintain or modestly adjust Father’s every‑other‑weekend parenting time in a way that minimizes excessive, back‑to‑back long‑distance travel for the child on school nights, while still affording Father regular, substantial parenting time on weekends and, if appropriate, during school vacations, holidays, or summer periods.

33. Mother is not seeking to change the designation of primary physical custody, which remains with Mother pursuant to the 2019 Judgment; rather, she seeks a targeted modification to the parenting schedule to protect the child’s best interests in light of the substantial increase in distance and the harmful impact on the child’s school functioning.

34. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to address the material change in circumstances and remains consistent with the guiding principle that children should have frequent and continuing contact with both parents when such contact is in the children’s best interests. See, e.g., Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. at 496–97; Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 262.

35. In light of the foregoing, modification of the existing custody/parenting time provisions of the 2019 Judgment is both warranted and necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2019 Judgment, particularly due to Father’s relocation approximately ninety (90) miles away and the resulting adverse impact of the current Wednesday midweek overnight on the child’s rest and school performance;

B. Find and rule that modification of the parenting time schedule is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Davis, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, G.L. c. 208, § 37, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and controlling case law including but not limited to Murphy v. Murphy, Custody of Vaughn, Custody of Kali, and related authorities;

C. Modify the May 15, 2019 Judgment to:

   1. Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time during the school year (or during any period when the child has school the next day);  

   2. Provide that Father may have reasonable weekday, non‑overnight parenting time or virtual/telephone contact as the parties may reasonably agree, so long as it does not require the child to wake at an unreasonably early hour or travel excessive distances on a school night; and  

   3. Confirm or reasonably adjust Father’s every‑other‑weekend parenting time schedule so that the child does not have to endure unnecessary long‑distance travel on school nights, while still ensuring regular, meaningful contact with Father primarily on weekends and, as appropriate, during school vacations and holidays;

D. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,

JESSICA THOMPSON,
