COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)


Plaintiff, Jessica L. Thompson (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Thompson”), for her Complaint against Defendant, Michael R. Harrison (“Defendant” or “Mr. Harrison”), states as follows:

-----------------------------
I. PARTIES
-----------------------------

1. Plaintiff Jessica L. Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts 02301.

2. Defendant Michael R. Harrison is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or manager and lessor of the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been the landlord of the Premises within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239 and is responsible for providing essential services, including hot water, in compliance with Massachusetts law and the applicable State Sanitary Code.

-----------------------------
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
-----------------------------

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action between landlord and tenant arising from the rental of residential premises located in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.

5. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 because the Premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, and the events and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

-----------------------------
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
-----------------------------

6. On or about April 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.

7. Plaintiff has at all relevant times been a tenant in lawful possession of the Premises, paying monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.00 to Defendant.

8. As part of the rental agreement, and by operation of law, Defendant was and is obligated to provide and maintain the Premises in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including the obligation to provide adequate and compliant hot water to the dwelling.

9. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease and tenancy agreement in Massachusetts and is expressly protected by G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

10. Around three weeks prior to December 1, 2025 (on or about early November 2025), the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment at the Premises ceased functioning, resulting in no hot water being available for bathing, washing dishes, or other normal household uses (the “Hot Water Interruption”).

11. On the same day the hot water went out, Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the Hot Water Interruption.

12. Defendant responded that the water heater required a replacement part and stated that he had ordered the part.

13. Approximately one week after Plaintiff first reported the Hot Water Interruption, there was still no hot water at the Premises.

14. Plaintiff again contacted Defendant, who stated that the necessary part for the water heater was “backordered” and not yet available.

15. After an additional week had passed, there was still no hot water at the Premises, and Defendant again gave Plaintiff essentially the same explanation, that he was “working on it” and that the supplier had not yet shipped the part.

16. As of the date of this Complaint, approximately three weeks have elapsed since the loss of hot water, and Plaintiff continues to be without hot water in her apartment.

17. During this entire period, Plaintiff has been forced to endure cold showers or to boil water in order to wash dishes and to meet basic hygiene and household needs.

18. Because she cannot reasonably bathe using cold water, Plaintiff has been compelled to obtain gym access for the specific purpose of using the shower facilities there, incurring a gym membership cost of approximately $30 per month, as well as additional gasoline and transportation expenses.

19. Plaintiff has a baby and cannot bathe her baby in cold water. As a result, Plaintiff has been forced to travel to her mother’s home to bathe the baby in hot water, causing inconvenience, distress, and additional transportation costs.

20. Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of the continuing lack of hot water and its significant impact on her and her child. Defendant has acknowledged the problem and provided assurances that he is “working on it,” but, despite the passage of almost a month, Defendant has failed to restore hot water service to the Premises.

21. The provision of hot water is an essential service required by law for residential premises in Massachusetts. See 105 C.M.R. 410.190, 410.190(A) (requiring landlords to provide and maintain adequate facilities for hot water at prescribed minimum temperatures).

22. Defendant’s failure for a period of approximately three weeks (and continuing) to provide hot water to the Premises constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy, use, and enjoyment of the Premises, including her ability to bathe, wash, and maintain sanitary and habitable living conditions for herself and her child.

23. Plaintiff has suffered actual harm as a result of Defendant’s failure to maintain hot water at the Premises, including, but not limited to, (a) loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, (b) interference with daily living and family routines, (c) the need to travel and bathe off‑site, (d) out‑of‑pocket costs for a gym membership and additional transportation expenses, and (e) emotional distress, discomfort, annoyance, and inconvenience.

24. Plaintiff estimates her damages relating to the period of lost hot water and associated expenses and loss of quiet enjoyment to be approximately $450.00, exclusive of statutory enhancements, costs, and interest.

25. Plaintiff has fully complied with her obligations under the tenancy, including paying rent and making reasonable efforts to communicate with Defendant about the problem.

26. Defendant’s failure to timely repair and restore hot water, despite actual notice of the Hot Water Interruption and the substantial interference it has caused, constitutes an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

-----------------------------
IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)
-----------------------------

27. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–26 as if fully set forth herein.

28. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” and is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, for such interference.

29. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every tenancy in Massachusetts. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).

30. A landlord’s failure to maintain essential services and sanitary conditions can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where such failure results in a serious or substantial interference with the tenant’s use of the premises. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 715–18 (1977); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983 (1982).

31. Massachusetts courts have held that repeated or prolonged sanitary code violations and loss of essential services, including heat or hot water, may constitute violations of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 786–87 (1994); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 760–61 (1979); McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 307–08 (1977).

32. The State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including 105 C.M.R. 410.190, requires landlords to supply and maintain adequate hot water facilities; a substantial and unreasonable failure to do so is a material breach of the landlord’s statutory duties and a substantial interference with the tenant’s occupancy.

33. By allowing the Premises to remain without hot water for approximately three weeks (and continuing as of the filing date) after receiving repeated notice from Plaintiff, Defendant has failed to provide an essential service required by law and has thereby substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

34. Defendant’s conduct constitutes unlawful “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, even if Defendant may have subjectively believed he was “working on” the problem. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. at 717–18 (landlord’s liability under covenant of quiet enjoyment does not require proof of malice or intent where the landlord’s acts or omissions, in their “natural and probable consequences,” interfere with tenants’ use of premises).

35. A landlord’s good faith efforts do not excuse a continuing substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment. The standard is based on the effect on the tenant, not solely the landlord’s intent. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284–85.

36. Plaintiff has suffered “actual and consequential damages” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 as a result of Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to (a) diminished rental value of the Premises during the period without hot water, (b) out‑of‑pocket expenses (gym membership and transportation), and (c) discomfort, annoyance, and loss of use and enjoyment.

37. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is strictly liable for at least three months’ rent or actual and consequential damages, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 775–76 (1994); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. at 786–87.

38. The monthly rent for the Premises is $1,200.00. Three months’ rent therefore equals $3,600.00.

39. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, as of the date of filing, are estimated at approximately $450.00, which is less than the statutory minimum of three months’ rent.

40. Accordingly, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and the governing case law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover at least $3,600.00 (three months’ rent), or such other amount as the Court finds just and proper under the statute, plus costs and, where applicable, reasonable attorney’s fees.

41. To the extent necessary, Plaintiff also relies by analogy on related landlord‑tenant authorities recognizing tenants’ rights to habitable premises and to statutory damages for serious interference with their tenancy, including G.L. c. 239, § 8A; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (recognizing implied warranty of habitability and interaction with quiet enjoyment); and Doe v. Boston Hous. Auth., 474 Mass. 486, 493–96 (2016) (discussing landlord’s statutory and common‑law duties toward tenants in residential housing).

42. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is ongoing, and Plaintiff reserves the right to seek additional damages at trial for any continued period of interference occurring after the date of filing.
