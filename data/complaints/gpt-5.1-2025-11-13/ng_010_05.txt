EMILY JOHNSON,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.

ROBERT SMITH,  
    Defendant.  
----------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)  

Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Robert Smith (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

-----------------------------------
I. PARTIES
-----------------------------------

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual who, at all relevant times, resided in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Robert Smith is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides at or owns and/or controls the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts (“the Property”), and at all relevant times was responsible for the care, maintenance, and control of the large maple tree located in the front yard of the Property and overhanging the public sidewalk.

-----------------------------------
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
-----------------------------------

3. This is an action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The amount in controversy exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore is within the original jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Berkshire County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and the Property that is the subject of this action is located in Berkshire County.

-----------------------------------
III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
-----------------------------------

6. On or about July 15, 2023, at approximately a time to be shown at trial, Plaintiff was lawfully walking along the public sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

7. The sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street is a public way customarily used by pedestrians, including Plaintiff, and Plaintiff was exercising due care while walking with grocery bags from a nearby store.

8. A large, mature maple tree is located in the front yard of the Property owned and/or controlled by Defendant, with substantial branches extending over and above the public sidewalk.

9. For a significant period of time prior to July 15, 2023—on information and belief, for months or longer—one of the major branches of that maple tree (the “Defective Branch”) was visibly cracked, drooping, and appeared damaged and unstable.

10. Plaintiff herself had repeatedly observed that the Defective Branch appeared cracked, droopy, and hazardous, and reasonably appeared at risk of falling.

11. On information and belief, various neighbors of the Property also observed the Defective Branch, recognized that it posed a danger to persons using the sidewalk, and communicated their concerns directly to Defendant.

12. On information and belief, at least one neighbor suggested to Defendant that he should have the tree and/or the Defective Branch evaluated and addressed by a qualified arborist or tree professional.

13. On information and belief, Defendant responded to such concerns, in substance, that he would “deal with it in the spring,” acknowledging awareness of the condition and the need for remedial action.

14. Despite this knowledge and the visible, deteriorated condition of the Defective Branch, Defendant failed to have the branch inspected, pruned, stabilized, or removed by an arborist or other competent professional, and failed to take any reasonable action to abate or warn of the danger.

15. On July 15, 2023, a typical summer thunderstorm occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

16. The weather conditions at the time were not extraordinary or unforeseeable; there were no tornado warnings, hurricanes, or other unusually severe phenomena—only a fairly normal summer storm with rain and wind.

17. During this storm, while Plaintiff was walking by the Property on the public sidewalk, the Defective Branch suddenly snapped and fell.

18. The Defective Branch struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground.

19. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in her shoulder, back, and other areas of her body and was dazed and shaken.

20. Plaintiff sought and obtained medical treatment for her injuries, including evaluation and treatment for a shoulder strain and extensive bruising to her shoulder, back, and body.

21. As a direct and proximate result of being struck by the Defective Branch, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain, extensive bruising, physical pain, and emotional distress.

22. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for evaluation, treatment, and follow-up care relating to her injuries.

23. As a direct result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work her regular shifts at her retail job for approximately one week, resulting in lost wages of approximately $600.

24. Plaintiff continues to experience intermittent pain and discomfort in her shoulder and back, and has been limited in some of her usual daily activities.

25. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled the Property and the maple tree on that Property, including the Defective Branch overhanging the public sidewalk.

26. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to persons lawfully using the public sidewalk, including Plaintiff, to maintain trees on his property in a reasonably safe condition and to take reasonable steps to address hazardous or defective conditions that he knew or should have known posed a foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians.

27. The cracked, drooping condition of the Defective Branch was open, obvious, and long-standing, such that Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the branch was likely to fall and cause injury to persons using the sidewalk during ordinary storms or wind events.

28. The risk that a visibly cracked and drooping branch overhanging a public sidewalk could fall during a normal summer thunderstorm and strike a pedestrian was reasonably foreseeable to a person in Defendant’s position.

29. Notwithstanding this foreseeable risk, Defendant failed to act as a reasonably prudent property owner would under the circumstances, and failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent injury to persons using the sidewalk, such as Plaintiff.

30. Defendant’s acts and omissions, including his failure to inspect, repair, remove, or otherwise address the Defective Branch, and failure to warn pedestrians of the hazard, constituted negligence.

31. Plaintiff was at all times in the exercise of due care for her own safety and did not contribute to the creation of the hazardous condition.

32. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical injuries, pain and suffering, emotional distress, lost wages, medical expenses, and other damages, all in an amount to be determined at trial, but in any event exceeding $25,000.

-----------------------------------
IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
NEGLIGENCE
-----------------------------------

33. Plaintiff restates and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully set forth herein.

34. Under Massachusetts common law, landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors and persons foreseeably on or near their property, including those using adjacent public ways, with respect to conditions on the land that pose an unreasonable risk of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (abolishing the common law distinction between licensees and invitees and holding landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995) (duty of reasonable care extends to persons in the vicinity of land where harm is foreseeable).

35. Defendant, as the owner and/or person in control of the Property and the maple tree in front yard of the Property, owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff, a foreseeable pedestrian using the adjacent public sidewalk, to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to prevent defective or dangerous conditions, including hazardous tree branches, from causing foreseeable injury. See Gertz v. E. S. Boulos Co., 451 Mass. 91, 94 (2008) (duty arises where defendant has control over the instrumentality of harm); Kane v. Fields Corner Grille, Inc., 341 Mass. 640, 641–42 (1961) (landowner has duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm from conditions on the premises).

36. Massachusetts law recognizes that landowners may be liable for harm caused by trees or branches under their control when they know or have reason to know that the tree or branch is decayed, defective, or otherwise poses an unreasonable risk of falling. See, e.g., Shiel v. Rowell, 480 Mass. 106, 110–11 (2018) (discussing duty regarding boundary trees and liability when landowner knows or has reason to know of a decayed or defective condition); O’Brien v. Christensen, 143 N.H. 379, 382 (1999) (cited with approval in Shiel, noting that liability may arise where a landowner knows or should know of defective or decayed trees presenting danger to users of a public way).

37. A property owner’s duty of reasonable care includes an obligation to take appropriate measures when a defect is visible and long-standing and presents a foreseeable risk of harm to people using adjacent public ways. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 376–77 (2010) (duty of reasonable care applies to hazards abutting public ways where harm is foreseeable); Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000) (landowner liable for harm caused by known or reasonably knowable dangerous conditions on property).

38. Foreseeability of harm is a key factor in determining the scope of the duty of care in negligence cases. See Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37, 40–41 (2009) (negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages; foreseeability of harm gives rise to duty); Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006) (foreseeability of risk from instrumentality under defendant’s control establishes duty to exercise reasonable care).

39. The defective condition of the maple tree branch on Defendant’s Property – cracked, drooping, and visibly weakened over an extended period – was such that Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the branch posed a significant risk of falling, especially during typical New England weather events such as a normal summer thunderstorm.

40. Defendant had actual and/or constructive notice of the hazardous condition based on: (a) the obvious, visible, cracked and drooping nature of the Defective Branch; (b) neighbors’ complaints and suggestions that Defendant have the tree checked by an arborist; and (c) Defendant’s own acknowledgment that he would “deal with it in the spring.” See Bencosme v. Kokoras, 400 Mass. 40, 42–43 (1987) (actual or constructive notice of dangerous condition is sufficient to impose liability); Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc., 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955) (liability where defendant knew or should have known of dangerous condition in time to remedy it).

41. Despite having actual and/or constructive notice, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, prune, secure, or remove the Defective Branch, or to engage a qualified arborist or other professional to do so, and failed to warn pedestrians of the danger.

42. A reasonable property owner in Defendant’s position, exercising ordinary care, would have recognized the risk posed by a visibly cracked and drooping branch overhanging a public sidewalk and would have taken timely corrective measures to prevent that branch from falling on a pedestrian.

43. Defendant’s failure to take any action to remedy or warn of this known, dangerous condition constitutes a breach of his duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts negligence law. See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 53 (1983) (breach occurs where defendant fails to take reasonable precautions commensurate with foreseeable risk); O’Sullivan v. Shaw, 431 Mass. 201, 204 (2000) (duty to act reasonably in light of foreseeable dangers).

44. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—being struck and injured by a falling tree branch over a public sidewalk—was a natural and foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to address the Defective Branch, particularly in light of its obvious condition and the ordinary occurrence of summer storms.

45. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of the incident on July 15, 2023, and of Plaintiff’s resulting injuries and damages. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002) (causation established where defendant’s breach is a substantial contributing factor in producing injury); Doull v. Foster, 487 Mass. 1, 8–9 (2021) (discussing cause-in-fact and proximate cause in negligence).

46. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of injury, did not create or contribute to the hazardous condition, and was using the public sidewalk in a normal and reasonable manner at the time of the incident.

47. Plaintiff at all times acted as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances and was in the exercise of due care for her own safety.

48. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages, among others, all in amounts to be proven at trial:

   a. Physical injuries, including shoulder strain and extensive bruising;

   b. Physical pain and suffering, both past and continuing;

   c. Emotional distress, including anxiety and distress associated with walking near trees or in storms;

   d. Medical expenses of approximately $2,500 to date, including emergency care, physician visits, medication, and related services, and any additional reasonable and necessary medical care that may be required in the future;

   e. Lost wages of approximately $600 due to Plaintiff’s inability to work for approximately one week following the incident;

   f. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with usual activities and recreation; and

   g. Any and all other damages recoverable under Massachusetts law.

49. Under Massachusetts comparative negligence law, G.L. c. 231, § 85, any alleged negligence on the part of Plaintiff (which is expressly denied) would not bar recovery unless greater than the negligence of Defendant, and Plaintiff’s damages would merely be diminished in proportion to any such negligence. Defendant’s negligence was at least equal to, and in fact substantially greater than, any negligence attributable to Plaintiff, if any.

50. Plaintiff is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all injuries and losses proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, together with costs and interest as provided by law. See G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B, 6H (pre- and post-judgment interest in tort actions).
