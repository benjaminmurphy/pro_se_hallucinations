Although the decision is about common\u2011law constructive eviction (not expressly G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14), Massachusetts courts treat this reasoning as applicable to statutory quiet enjoyment: the focus is on the seriousness of the interference and the landlord\u2019s control, not on promises to fix it.
