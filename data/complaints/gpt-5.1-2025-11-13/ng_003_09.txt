                                                   CIVIL ACTION NO. _________

    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  
               COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
------------------------------------------------------  

Plaintiff Julia Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against defendant Bargain Home Goods, Inc. (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

                               PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Julia Thompson is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Bargain Home Goods, Inc. (“Bargain Home Goods”) is a corporation or other business entity organized under the laws of, and/or registered to do business in, a state of the United States, with at least one retail store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

3. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant owned, leased, operated, managed, controlled, and/or maintained a retail discount home-goods store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852 (the “Premises”).

                         JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because Plaintiff seeks damages in an amount greater than $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to G.L. c. 223A, §§ 3(a)–(d), because Defendant transacts business in Massachusetts, contracts to supply services or things in Massachusetts, and committed a tortious act within Massachusetts causing injury to Plaintiff in Massachusetts.

6. Venue is proper in Middlesex County under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 223, § 8 because the cause of action arose in Middlesex County, specifically at Defendant’s store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

                             JURY DEMAND

7. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 38 and Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

                        FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

8. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff lawfully entered Defendant’s retail store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852, as a business invitee and customer, to shop for kitchen and household items.

9. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty of reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition, to protect Plaintiff against unreasonable risks of harm of which Defendant knew or should have known, and to warn Plaintiff of any such dangers that were not open and obvious. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206 (1978).

10. On July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was in the aisle of the store where kitchen appliances and related goods were displayed.

11. In that aisle, Defendant had stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including a large toaster-oven, on shelving several boxes high—approximately five or six boxes high—without any securing straps, safety bars, netting, rails, or other barriers to prevent the boxes from falling.

12. The boxes were stacked in an unstable or unsafe manner that created an unreasonable risk that they could fall into the customer aisle with normal customer activity.

13. Defendant, through its employees and managers, knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known that stacking heavy appliance boxes several units high above customer head level without straps or barriers created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to customers.

14. Defendant knew or should have known that customers regularly used shopping carts in that aisle and that carts would reasonably be expected to bump or lightly contact the shelving during normal use.

15. Defendant either created this dangerous condition by stacking and displaying the heavy boxes in this manner, or allowed this condition to exist for a sufficient time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable inspection and maintenance procedures, should have discovered and remedied it. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

16. Defendant failed to implement or follow reasonable safety procedures to ensure that heavy items stored above head height were secured, including but not limited to: (a) limiting the height of stacked boxes; (b) installing guard rails or restraints on upper shelves; (c) using shrink-wrap or straps; or (d) placing heavy merchandise on lower, safer shelving.

17. While Plaintiff was examining kitchen merchandise in the aisle, another customer was pushing a shopping cart down the same aisle.

18. The other customer’s cart made a routine, relatively minor contact with the lower portion of the shelf, a type of contact that is reasonably foreseeable in an ordinary retail environment.

19. Upon this ordinary bump, a large, heavy toaster-oven box stored near the top of the shelving—approximately five or six boxes up—was dislodged and fell from above Plaintiff’s head.

20. The falling toaster-oven box struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and side of the head.

21. Immediately after being struck, Plaintiff became dizzy and experienced significant pain and a severe headache.

22. Plaintiff promptly reported the incident to store personnel, and a manager came to the scene.

23. The manager acknowledged the incident, completed an incident report on behalf of Defendant, and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.

24. The offer of a store coupon, instead of appropriate medical assistance or serious concern for safety, further reflects Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent or respond appropriately to foreseeable customer injuries.

25. Later that day, Plaintiff’s symptoms, including dizziness and headache, worsened.

26. That night, as her symptoms intensified, Plaintiff sought medical evaluation and treatment at an emergency room.

27. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was examined and diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain, causally related to the incident at Defendant’s store.

28. Following the incident, Plaintiff continued to suffer from headaches, dizziness, shoulder pain, and other discomfort.

29. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,800 in medical expenses for hospital/emergency room treatment, follow-up visits, and related care associated with her mild concussion and shoulder strain.

30. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was employed as a delivery driver.

31. As a direct and foreseeable result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to perform her regular work duties for several days and lost approximately $600 in wages.

32. Plaintiff’s injuries also prevented her from engaging in her usual recreational activity of playing in a weekly soccer league for approximately one month, resulting in loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal daily and recreational activities.

33. Plaintiff continues to experience residual symptoms and discomfort, particularly with her shoulder and occasional headaches, and has suffered, and may continue to suffer, pain, discomfort, and limitations.

34. Defendant, acting by and through its employees, servants, and agents, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, control, inspection, stocking, and maintenance of the Premises, including its shelving and merchandise displays.

35. Defendant breached that duty by, among other things:

    a. Stacking heavy appliance boxes several units high above head level without adequate securing devices such as straps, bars, netting, or safety rails;

    b. Failing to implement and enforce reasonable policies and procedures for safe stocking and display of heavy merchandise;

    c. Failing to properly train and supervise employees on safe stocking methods and the risks associated with overhead storage of heavy items;

    d. Failing to inspect the shelving and merchandise displays with reasonable frequency and adequacy to detect and correct unsafe stacking conditions;

    e. Failing to warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the danger of falling merchandise created by Defendant’s stacking practices;

    f. Allowing a condition to exist in which an ordinary and foreseeable bump from a shopping cart would cause heavy merchandise to fall onto customers below.

36. The risk that heavy boxes stacked high above customers could fall if the shelves were subject to normal, foreseeable contact from shopping carts was foreseeable to a reasonably prudent store operator.

37. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent such an occurrence was a breach of the standard of care owed to customers like Plaintiff. See Ulwick v. DeChristopher, 411 Mass. 401 (1991) (duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983) (foreseeability as basis of duty).

38. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, including her mild concussion, shoulder strain, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312 (2002) (traditional elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, damages).

39. Plaintiff did not contribute to the creation of the dangerous condition and acted reasonably and prudently at all relevant times.

40. To the extent any comparative negligence may be alleged, Plaintiff’s share of any such negligence, if any, is less than fifty-one percent, and her recovery is therefore not barred, but may only be diminished in proportion to any such negligence, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85.

41. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant is responsible not only for its own acts and omissions, but also vicariously for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and servants acting within the scope of their employment under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317 (2002).

42. As a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer bodily injury, pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, lost wages, and medical expenses, and is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation for all such damages. See Mirageas v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 391 Mass. 815 (1984).

                            COUNT I  
                          NEGLIGENCE  
                (Against Bargain Home Goods, Inc.)

43. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 42 above as if fully set forth herein.

44. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect Plaintiff against and warn her of foreseeable and unreasonable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206 (1978).

45. This duty includes, but is not limited to: (a) inspecting the Premises and displays at reasonable intervals; (b) safely stocking and arranging merchandise, especially heavy items; (c) correcting or removing hazardous conditions within a reasonable time; and (d) warning customers of non-obvious hazards. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

46. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and servants, breached its duty of reasonable care by creating and/or allowing a dangerous and unsafe condition to exist at the Premises, including stacking heavy appliance boxes several units high above customer head level without adequate restraints or safeguards.

47. Defendant further breached its duty by failing to implement or follow adequate safety policies, procedures, inspections, and training concerning the stacking and display of heavy merchandise in areas accessible to customers.

48. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the dangerous condition created by its stacking of heavy boxes and the foreseeable risk that normal customer conduct—such as a shopping cart lightly bumping the shelf—could cause such boxes to fall.

49. Under Massachusetts law, when a store creates a hazardous condition or the nature of its business makes such conditions reasonably foreseeable, the plaintiff may establish negligence without proving actual or constructive notice of a specific defect. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780 (2007).

50. The unstable stacking of heavy boxes at a height above customer head level constituted an unreasonable risk of harm that Defendant failed to guard against, in violation of its duty of care under Massachusetts common law. See Ulwick v. DeChristopher, 411 Mass. 401 (1991); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983).

51. Defendant’s breaches of duty constitute negligence under Massachusetts law, as defined by the elements articulated in Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312 (2002), and related cases.

52. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, a heavy toaster-oven box fell from the upper shelving and struck Plaintiff on the head and shoulder on July 15, 2023.

53. The incident caused Plaintiff to sustain a mild concussion and a shoulder strain, as diagnosed at the emergency room and/or by subsequent medical providers.

54. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,800 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses, including emergency room treatment and follow-up care, and approximately $600 in lost wages due to missed work as a delivery driver.

55. Plaintiff also suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, mental anguish, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment of life, including being unable to participate in her weekly soccer league for approximately one month and enduring ongoing residual symptoms.

56. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Defendant all damages reasonably arising from Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and any other allowable damages under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; Mirageas v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 391 Mass. 815 (1984); Haddad v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 455 Mass. 91 (2009).

57. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B, Plaintiff is also entitled to prejudgment interest on any damages awarded for personal injuries from the date of commencement of this action.

58. To the extent Defendant may assert that the actions of a third party (the other customer) were the sole cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, such defense is invalid because the risk that another customer might bump the shelves with a cart is precisely the type of normal, foreseeable customer conduct that Defendant had a duty to anticipate and protect against. See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (foreseeable third-party acts do not break chain of causation).

59. Under the comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85, any allegation of negligence by Plaintiff, which is denied, would at most reduce but not bar her recovery so long as her negligence does not exceed that of Defendant.

60. Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and servants who created, maintained, or failed to correct the dangerous stacking condition on the Premises while acting within the scope of their employment. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317 (2002).

61. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were a direct, natural, and foreseeable result of Defendant’s negligence.

                       PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Julia Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Bargain Home Goods, Inc. on Count I (Negligence);
