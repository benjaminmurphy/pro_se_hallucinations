JESSICA MARTIN,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                               
                                                   CIVIL ACTION NO. __________

ROBERT THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

                       COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Jessica Martin (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Robert Thompson (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

                              I.   PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Martin is an individual residing in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times resided at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

2. Defendant Robert Thompson is an individual who, on information and belief, resides in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, and at all relevant times resided in the other unit of the duplex located at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

3. At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff and Defendant shared use of the driveway located at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.

                     II.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 when including property damage, consequential damages, costs, and interest, or, in the alternative, because Plaintiff elects to file in the Superior Court.

5. Personal jurisdiction over Defendant is proper because Defendant is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the acts and omissions complained of occurred within Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

6. Venue is proper in Hampden Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 & 2, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Hampden County and both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Hampden County.

                         III.   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who reside in a duplex located at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and share a common driveway on the premises.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant owned, possessed, and/or controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder (the “Ladder”) that he used and kept on or about the shared driveway area and adjacent wooden fence on the premises.

9. For a significant period of time prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant stored the Ladder in an upright, leaning position against the wooden fence located immediately adjacent to the area of the driveway where Plaintiff regularly parked and maneuvered her vehicle.

10. The Ladder was tall, made of aluminum, and relatively light in weight, such that it was susceptible to being blown or toppled by strong winds or gusts.

11. Defendant did not secure the Ladder by tying it down, anchoring it, or otherwise stabilizing it, and did not store it in a horizontal or otherwise safe position.

12. Plaintiff regularly observed the Ladder leaning unsecured against the fence near her parking space in the shared driveway.

13. Prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed to Defendant, on at least two separate occasions, her concern that the Ladder, leaning unsecured against the fence, might fall over and damage her vehicle, particularly on windy days.

14. Plaintiff specifically told Defendant that she was worried that strong or gusty winds could knock the Ladder over onto her car.

15. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and stated that he would either tie the Ladder down or move it, but he failed to do so and continued to leave the Ladder leaning unsecured against the fence.

16. Defendant’s prior knowledge of both the condition (an unsecured, tall, aluminum ladder leaning next to Plaintiff’s parking area) and Plaintiff’s expressed safety concerns made the risk that the Ladder could fall and damage Plaintiff’s property plainly foreseeable.

17. On March 15, 2023, at approximately [time unknown, e.g., afternoon], conditions in Springfield, Massachusetts, were windy, with gusts sufficient to move unsecured light objects such as an aluminum extension ladder.

18. On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the shared driveway at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, to park in her customary space adjacent to the wooden fence where the Ladder was leaning.

19. While Plaintiff was in the process of backing her vehicle into the parking area, a gust of wind knocked the unsecured Ladder off the fence.

20. The Ladder fell with force onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, crashing onto the hood and windshield.

21. The impact from the Ladder dented the hood of Plaintiff’s vehicle and cracked the windshield.

22. As a direct and immediate result of the Ladder’s impact, Plaintiff’s vehicle suffered significant physical damage, including but not limited to:

   a. Dents and deformation to the hood; and  
   b. Cracking and damage to the windshield requiring replacement.

23. Although the vehicle remained mechanically drivable, the damage to the hood and windshield rendered it unsafe and not reasonably usable for normal driving until repairs were completed.

24. Plaintiff arranged for repairs to her vehicle, including bodywork to repair the damaged hood and replacement of the cracked windshield.

25. Plaintiff’s automobile insurer covered part of the repair costs, but Plaintiff was required to pay her insurance deductible out-of-pocket.

26. Plaintiff also had to rent a replacement vehicle while her own car was in the repair shop for over a week.

27. The repairs and associated rental caused Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses including, but not limited to:

   a. Payment of her insurance deductible;  
   b. Rental car charges during the repair period; and  
   c. Other incidental expenses associated with the loss of use of her vehicle.

28. Plaintiff’s damages consist entirely of property damage, loss of use of her vehicle, and consequential out-of-pocket economic losses. Plaintiff incurred no medical expenses, and she did not lose wages as a result of the incident.

29. At all relevant times, Defendant had the ability, opportunity, and obligation to store the Ladder in a reasonably safe manner and to prevent it from posing an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff’s property.

30. Reasonable and simple measures, including but not limited to tying or otherwise securing the Ladder, storing it horizontally, moving it away from the immediate vicinity of Plaintiff’s parking area, or placing it inside a garage or shed, would have significantly reduced or eliminated the risk that the Ladder would be blown over and strike Plaintiff’s vehicle.

31. Defendant nonetheless failed to take any such reasonable measures, and he left the Ladder leaning unsecured against the fence, despite his knowledge of the windy conditions that routinely occur in March in Springfield, Massachusetts.

32. The Ladder’s falling onto Plaintiff’s vehicle during windy conditions was the very type of harm that Plaintiff had previously expressed concern about to Defendant.

33. Defendant’s decision to leave the Ladder unsecured in a location where it could foreseeably fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, after Plaintiff had specifically warned him of this risk, created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm.

34. But for Defendant’s negligent storage and failure to secure the Ladder, the Ladder would not have fallen onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, and Plaintiff’s property would not have been damaged.

35. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage and economic losses.

36. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered property damage, loss of use of her vehicle, out-of-pocket expenses, inconvenience, and other consequential damages, in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

                         IV.   CAUSE OF ACTION  
                         NEGLIGENCE (COMMON LAW)  

37. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others and their property. See, e.g.,  
   • Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 146–47 (2006);  
   • Remy v. MacDonald, 440 Mass. 675, 677–78 (2004);  
   • Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995);  
   • G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence; presupposing existence of negligence duty and breach).

39. A negligence claim in Massachusetts requires: (1) a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the breach and the injury; and (4) actual damages. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 146; Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

Duty  

40. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the use and storage of his personal property, including the Ladder, so as not to create an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff and her property. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 146–47 (duty arises where conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm to another); Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (land possessors and those in control of property must act reasonably to prevent harm).

41. Defendant also owed Plaintiff a duty not to unreasonably endanger her property in the shared driveway area that both parties regularly used and that Defendant knew Plaintiff relied upon for parking and maneuvering her vehicle. See Davis, 420 Mass. at 743–44 (duty of reasonable care grounded in foreseeability of harm to persons lawfully on premises); Flood v. Southland Corp., 416 Mass. 62, 67 (1993).

42. Defendant’s duty included the obligation to secure or properly store objects on or near the shared driveway, such as the Ladder, to prevent them from being blown or knocked over onto Plaintiff’s vehicle in foreseeable windy conditions. See Yakubowicz v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 404 Mass. 624, 629 (1989) (duty measured by what a reasonably prudent person would anticipate as possible harm).

Breach  

43. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Storing a tall, light aluminum extension ladder in an upright position, leaning unsecured against a fence adjacent to Plaintiff’s regular parking area;  
   b. Failing to tie, anchor, or otherwise secure the Ladder to prevent it from falling during windy weather;  
   c. Failing to store the Ladder in a safer location or position away from the area where Plaintiff parked and maneuvered her vehicle;  
   d. Failing to respond reasonably to Plaintiff’s specific complaints and warnings that she was concerned the Ladder might fall onto her car, especially on windy days; and  
   e. Failing to take simple, inexpensive precautions that a reasonably prudent person would have taken under similar circumstances.

44. The risk that a tall, unsecured aluminum extension ladder leaning against a fence near a driveway could fall during windy conditions and strike a nearby vehicle is obvious and foreseeable to an ordinary, reasonably prudent person.

45. Plaintiff’s explicit prior warnings to Defendant further highlighted the foreseeability of the exact harm that ultimately occurred, making Defendant’s failure to secure or relocate the Ladder unreasonable and negligent.

46. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances under Massachusetts law. See Jupin, 447 Mass. at 146–47; Glidden, 430 Mass. at 696.

Causation  

47. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages.

48. But for Defendant’s failure to secure or safely store the Ladder, the Ladder would not have been able to fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle when the wind gust occurred, and Plaintiff’s vehicle would not have been damaged.

49. The type of harm suffered by Plaintiff—physical damage to her vehicle and resulting economic losses from repairs and loss of use—was precisely the kind of harm that was reasonably foreseeable from leaving a tall, unsecured ladder leaning adjacent to a driveway in windy conditions, particularly after Plaintiff had complained of that exact risk. See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (proximate cause satisfied where harm is within the scope of foreseeable risk).

50. There were no superseding or intervening causes breaking the chain of causation between Defendant’s negligence and Plaintiff’s harm. The occurrence of windy conditions in March in Springfield, Massachusetts, was entirely foreseeable and ordinary, and not an extraordinary event. See Fenn v. Mansfield, 331 Mass. 466, 469 (1954) (foreseeable natural forces do not break chain of causation).

Damages  

51. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage and economic loss, including but not limited to:

   a. Physical damage to the hood of her vehicle;  
   b. Cracking and damage to the windshield of her vehicle;  
   c. Out-of-pocket payment of her automobile insurance deductible;  
   d. Costs associated with renting a replacement vehicle while her own vehicle was being repaired; and  
   e. Other incidental expenses and loss of use associated with being without her vehicle for over a week.

52. Plaintiff sustained no bodily injury, incurred no medical expenses, and lost no wages as a result of the incident; however, her property damage and economic losses are significant, and she seeks compensation therefor.

53. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including the reasonable cost of repairing her vehicle, the reasonable rental value or actual cost of a substitute vehicle during the repair period, her insurance deductible, and other consequential damages. See Hopkins v. Medeiros, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 603 (2000) (damages for property loss include cost of repair and loss of use); Guaranty-First Trust Co. v. Textron, Inc., 416 Mass. 332, 336 (1993).

54. Plaintiff also seeks statutory post‑judgment interest on any damages awarded, pursuant to G.L. c. 235, § 8, and prejudgment interest as applicable pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B or § 6C (depending on classification of the claim as personal or property damage in tort).

Comparative Negligence  

55. Under G.L. c. 231, § 85, any comparative negligence by Plaintiff, if alleged, does not bar recovery unless her negligence exceeded that of Defendant, and merely reduces damages in proportion to any such negligence. Plaintiff asserts that she acted reasonably at all times and was not negligent, and that any comparative negligence on her part is zero.

                          V.   APPLICABLE LAW  

56. This action is brought under the common law of negligence of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as recognized and applied in decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and the Massachusetts Appeals Court, including but not limited to:

   a. Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141 (2006) (duty based on foreseeability of harm from manner of storing an object);  
   b. Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694 (2000) (elements of negligence and causation);  
   c. Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739 (1995) (duty of reasonable care grounded in foreseeability);  
   d. Yakubowicz v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 404 Mass. 624 (1989) (scope of duty and foreseeability);  
   e. Flood v. Southland Corp., 416 Mass. 62 (1993) (duty to protect against foreseeable harms on premises);  
   f. Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637 (1996) (duty of care of those in control of property);  
   g. Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101 (1978) (proximate cause and foreseeable risk);  
   h. Hopkins v. Medeiros, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 600 (2000) (measure of damages for property damage, including loss of use); and  
   i. Guaranty-First Trust Co. v. Textron, Inc., 416 Mass. 332 (1993) (damages principles).

57. This Complaint also relies on the following Massachusetts statutes, among others:

   a. G.L. c. 212, § 4 (jurisdiction of the Superior Court);  
   b. G.L. c. 223 & c. 223A (venue and personal jurisdiction);  
   c. G.L. c. 231, § 85 (comparative negligence);  
   d. G.L. c. 231, §§ 6B & 6C (prejudgment interest); and  
   e. G.L. c. 235, § 8 (post‑judgment interest).

                          VI.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Martin respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Robert Thompson, and award the following relief:

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:

   1. The reasonable cost of repairing the damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, including the hood and windshield;  
   2. Reimbursement of Plaintiff’s insurance deductible;  
   3. The reasonable cost or rental value of a substitute vehicle for the period during which Plaintiff’s vehicle was out of service; and  
   4. Any other consequential and incidental economic damages resulting from the loss of use and damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle;

B. Prejudgment interest as allowed by law, including pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B and/or § 6C;

C. Post‑judgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 235, § 8;

D. Costs of this action as permitted by law;

E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
