MARK THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
______________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
______________________________  

Plaintiff Jessica Adams (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Adams (“Adams”) is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson (“Thompson”) is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, manages, and/or controls the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Premises”), including Plaintiff’s second‑floor apartment and the third‑floor apartment directly above Plaintiff.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant has been Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and applicable Massachusetts common law.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The Somerville District Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 19A, and G.L. c. 212, because the amount in controversy is less than $50,000 and the claims arise under Massachusetts law.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 223, § 8 because the Premises are located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this judicial district.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendant for the second‑floor apartment at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (the “Apartment”).

8. Plaintiff has, at all relevant times, paid monthly rent of $1,800 to Defendant as required by the Lease.

9. The Lease provides, in substance, that Plaintiff shall have “quiet enjoyment” of the Apartment.

10. Under Massachusetts law, every tenancy carries an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and G.L. c. 186, § 14 further provides that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” See, e.g., *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997); *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

11. Approximately six months before the filing of this Complaint (on or about June 1, 2025), new tenants moved into the third‑floor apartment directly above Plaintiff’s Apartment. Those tenants are also tenants of Defendant.

12. Since moving in, the upstairs tenants have engaged in extremely loud and disruptive conduct on a frequent and ongoing basis, including but not limited to:

   a. Heavy stomping and walking with excessive force at all hours, including late at night and early morning;

   b. Playing loud music late into the night;

   c. Moving furniture and making banging or dragging noises, often around or after midnight.

13. The noise and disturbances described above occur on a recurrent, near‑daily basis and routinely continue late into the night, materially disturbing Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and to use and enjoy her Apartment.

14. Plaintiff has averaged approximately four to five hours of sleep per night as a result of the ongoing noise and disturbances.

15. Plaintiff has made multiple good‑faith efforts to resolve the situation without court intervention. She has:

   a. Politely spoken directly with the upstairs tenants and asked that they keep the noise down;

   b. Sent or made approximately five or six complaints to Defendant over several months, by phone and/or other communication, informing him of the continuing disturbances and their impact on her health and ability to live peacefully in the Apartment.

16. After Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant spoke to the upstairs tenants only once (to Plaintiff’s knowledge), and then told Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live” or words to that effect.

17. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, and despite Defendant’s control over the Premises and the tenancies within the building, Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable, effective steps to abate or remedy the excessive noise and disturbances, such as:

   a. Issuing written warnings or lease‑enforcement notices to the upstairs tenants;

   b. Modifying or enforcing reasonable house rules regarding quiet hours;

   c. Investigating, documenting, or otherwise addressing the pattern of disturbances;

   d. Pursuing any meaningful changes to the upstairs tenants’ conduct or tenancy.

18. Defendant’s failure to act is not a mere omission in the abstract; by continuing to rent and maintain the upstairs apartment in a manner that allows serious and chronic noise disturbances to persist, after repeated actual notice, Defendant has indirectly but substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and controlling precedent. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 717–19 (landlord liable for interference with quiet enjoyment where third‑party conduct is a “natural and probable consequence” of landlord’s actions or inactions); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284–86 (1994).

19. In an attempt to mitigate the harm, Plaintiff has purchased earplugs, a white‑noise machine, and rearranged her bedroom in an effort to reduce the impact of the noise, but these steps have not meaningfully alleviated the problem.

20. Because of chronic sleep deprivation caused by the noise, Plaintiff has suffered tangible employment consequences. Specifically, she received a written warning at work after falling asleep at her desk, jeopardizing her job security and professional reputation.

21. Plaintiff’s chronic sleep loss and stress have also caused physical and emotional harm. Her physician has prescribed sleep medication, which Plaintiff must take regularly and which costs approximately $40 per month.

22. The ongoing disturbances, and Defendant’s failure to remedy them, have caused Plaintiff substantial loss of use and enjoyment of her home, stress, anxiety, sleep deprivation, and associated economic losses.

23. Plaintiff estimates that she has suffered at least $2,500 in damages as a result of Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment, including, but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment;

   b. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for sleep medication (approximately $40 per month) and mitigation efforts (earplugs, white‑noise machine);

   c. Employment‑related harm and risk due to sleep deprivation;

   d. Physical and emotional distress.

24. Defendant’s conduct, after repeated actual notice of the problem and its seriousness, was willful or, at a minimum, in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 983–84 (1982); *Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.*, 439 Mass. 512, 515–18 (2003).

25. At all times relevant, Plaintiff has complied with her material obligations under the Lease and Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

26. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–25 above as if fully set forth herein.

27. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is liable where he “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.” This statutory covenant supplements and reinforces the common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in residential tenancies. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–06 (1982).

28. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord may be liable under G.L. c. 186, § 14 when the landlord’s actions or inactions, after notice, result in recurring conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises—even when the immediate source of the disturbance is a third party. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–19; *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 284–86.

29. A breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when the interference is “serious” and “substantial,” and not merely a trifling annoyance or inconvenience. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03; *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929).

30. By allowing the chronic, severe noise and disturbances from the upstairs tenants to persist for months after being notified repeatedly, and by failing to take reasonable, available steps to correct or abate those disturbances, Defendant has indirectly but effectively interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

31. The level, frequency, and duration of the noise and disturbances have substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use of her home and sleep, and have caused health, emotional, and economic harm, constituting a serious interference with her tenancy under Massachusetts law. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–06; *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 873–74 (1991) (emotional distress damages recoverable for breach of quiet enjoyment); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

32. Defendant’s failure and refusal to take reasonable steps to address the ongoing disturbances, despite repeated notice and an ongoing duty to maintain Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, was intentional, willful, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s statutory and contractual rights. See *Fafard v. Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc.*, 439 Mass. at 515–18; *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983–84.

33. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of her home;

   b. Sleep deprivation and related physical and emotional distress;

   c. Increased medical expenses for sleep medication and other mitigation measures;

   d. Employment‑related harm and risk, including a written warning for falling asleep at work.

34. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is presently self‑represented, she seeks her statutory damages and costs, and reserves the right to seek attorney’s fees if she later retains counsel.

35. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,800; three months’ rent thus equals $5,400. Plaintiff’s claimed actual damages are at least $2,500. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is therefore entitled to statutory damages of at least $5,400, plus costs, because three months’ rent exceeds her claimed actual damages. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 110–11 (statutory minimum damages under § 14); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. at 872–75.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Adams respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law;

B. An award of damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than the greater of:

   1. Plaintiff’s actual damages, reasonably estimated at $2,500 or more; or  

   2. Three months’ rent, currently totaling $5,400 ($1,800 × 3);

C. An award of damages for Plaintiff’s emotional distress and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises, as permitted under *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–06, and *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. at 873–75;

D. An award of costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs;

E. An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff retains counsel at any future time;

F. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to injunctive or declaratory relief to ensure Plaintiff’s future quiet enjoyment of the Premises.
