It holds Gem liable under \u00a7 14 for repeated flooding that substantially interfered with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the apartment, without any requirement of actual eviction, thereby supporting the proposition that substantial impairment alone constitutes a breach under \u00a7 14.",
