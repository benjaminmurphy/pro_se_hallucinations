While one might infer that all Sanitary/Building Code\u2013mandated life-safety elements are components of habitability, this case itself focuses on heat, hot water, and general code compliance, not on a distinct duty to maintain safe egress or fire\u2011safety systems. Thus it is indirect and not strong authority for the precise proposition stated.",

Whether the scope of the warranty is broader is an open question.\u201d (citations omitted)."

Justice Quirico argues that these housing statutes, ordinances, and codes \"prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units\" impose on the landlord, for the benefit of tenants, an obligation to comply with those standards as part of making the premises fit for human habitation. While fire\u2011safety and egress are not singled out by name in this excerpt, the opinion\u2019s reasoning treats statutory safety and structural requirements as part of the landlord\u2019s habitability obligation, so the case supports the general proposition at a moderate level of specificity.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Since 1960 dwelling units have been subject to the State Sanitary Code... The Code, which has the force of law and applies throughout the Commonwealth, fixes minimum standards of fitness of structures for human habitation. It does so in great detail... It expressly places the burden on the owner to comply with the prescribed minimum physical standards for rented dwelling units. ... I would reverse that rule and hold instead (a) that the various statutes, ordinances, by-laws, rules, regulations and codes prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards..."

It does not set out or reaffirm any general rule that a defendant is liable for \u201call damages proximately caused by its negligence.\u201d The opinion assumes negligence and causation for purposes of the certified questions but does not discuss the scope of damages or articulate a general proximate-cause damages rule, so it cannot be cited as authority for that broad proposition.",
