v.  

DAVID SMITH,  
    Defendant/Respondent.

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Physical Custody / Parenting Time / Decision‑Making)


NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith (“Mother”), and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time order, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Emily Smith and Jacob Smith.

2. The Defendant, David Smith (“Father”), is an individual residing in Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children, Emily Smith and Jacob Smith.

3. The minor children of the parties are:  
   a. Emily Smith, age 10; and  
   b. Jacob Smith, age 7.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208 and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as this is a domestic relations matter involving custody, parenting time, and related orders concerning minor children of the parties.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior custody order was entered in this Court and the parties and children reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 5, 28.

6. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (as applicable to custody and parenting time), which authorize the Court to modify existing custody and visitation orders upon a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the children.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT / ORDER

7. On or about April 15, 2022, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order governing legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time of the minor children (the “2022 Order”).

8. Under the 2022 Order, the parties were awarded joint legal custody of the minor children.

9. Under the 2022 Order, Mother was granted primary physical custody of the children, with the children residing with Mother the majority of the time, and Father was granted a regular, scheduled parenting time arrangement.

10. The 2022 Order further provides, in substance, that the parties are to:
    a. Support the children’s relationship with each parent; and  
    b. Refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence or hearing of the children.

11. The 2022 Order remains in full force and effect, and has not been vacated, superseded, or otherwise modified by further order of this Court.

### IV. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION

12. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children of the parties, if the Court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the children has occurred and that the modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.”

13. Massachusetts appellate courts have consistently held that:
    a. A custody or parenting time order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior judgment; and  
    b. The paramount consideration is the best interests of the child. See, e.g.,  
       i.   Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981);  
       ii.  Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
       iii. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
       iv.  Custody of Zia, 455 Mass. 327 (2009);  
       v.   Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996);  
       vi.  Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

14. The “best interests of the child” standard, as codified in G.L. c. 208, § 31 and elaborated in cases such as Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–844, focuses on the child’s welfare, emotional health, stability, and the ability of each parent to foster the child’s relationship with the other parent. See also Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).

15. In determining whether a modification is warranted, the Court may consider, among other things:
    a. The capacity and willingness of each parent to support and encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent;  
    b. The level of conflict and its impact on the children;  
    c. The emotional and physical well‑being of the children; and  
    d. The stability and predictability of the children’s residential schedule and routine. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–845; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596.

16. Massachusetts law disfavors a parent’s conduct that undermines the children’s relationship with the other parent or exposes the children to disparaging comments about the other parent, as such behavior may be contrary to their best interests. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 401–403 (1981); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–740 (1996); Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. at 619–620.

### V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

17. Since entry of the 2022 Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the minor children and the parties’ co‑parenting relationship.

18. Over the past year, Father has repeatedly enrolled or signed the children up for activities (including extracurricular, social, or recreational events) that take place during Mother’s regularly scheduled parenting time, without first discussing such activities with Mother or obtaining her consent, despite the parties’ joint legal custody arrangement.

19. Father has then represented to the children that Mother is “selfish” or that she “does not really love them” when scheduling conflicts arise and Mother requests that the children attend to their existing parenting schedule or seeks to discuss alternative arrangements.

20. Father has told the children, in substance, that it is Mother’s fault if they miss activities scheduled by Father during Mother’s parenting time, thereby placing blame on Mother in the children’s eyes and undermining Mother’s relationship with the children.

21. The children have reported to Mother that Father calls Mother “selfish” and says she “doesn’t really love them” when Mother asks to swap weekends or maintain her scheduled parenting time.

22. This pattern of conduct violates, in substance and effect, the 2022 Order’s requirement that each parent support the children’s relationship with the other parent and refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children.

23. As a result of the increased conflict and Father’s negative comments and blame‑shifting, at least one of the children has begun experiencing physical symptoms of stress, including stomach aches on or around transition days between households.

24. The children’s reported stress and physical complaints are reasonably connected to the tension and confusion created by Father’s unilateral scheduling of activities during Mother’s parenting time and Father’s disparaging remarks about Mother concerning such scheduling issues.

25. Father’s repeated unilateral decision‑making regarding the children’s activities during Mother’s scheduled weekends is inconsistent with the spirit and letter of joint legal custody under G.L. c. 208, § 31, which contemplates shared responsibility and consultation on major decisions affecting the children’s welfare.

26. The pattern of Father’s behavior has eroded the cooperative co‑parenting that the 2022 Order presupposed and has created instability and emotional strain for the children.

27. Father’s conduct has had the effect of:
    a. Undermining the children’s trust in the parenting schedule;  
    b. Creating loyalty conflicts, whereby the children feel they must choose between complying with Mother’s scheduled time and attending activities arranged by Father; and  
    c. Damaging the children’s perception of Mother due to Father’s disparaging comments.

28. The deterioration in the parents’ ability to jointly exercise legal custody and to coordinate the children’s schedules, combined with Father’s efforts to shift blame onto Mother and disparage her to the children, constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the 2022 Order.

29. These developments were not contemplated at the time of the 2022 Order and significantly affect the children’s emotional well‑being and stability, thereby meeting the threshold for modification under G.L. c. 208, § 28. See Schuler, 382 Mass. at 370–371; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. at 595–596.

### VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

30. It is in the best interests of Emily and Jacob that their primary residence and day‑to‑day care be clarified and that decision‑making authority regarding their schedules and activities be more clearly allocated to protect their emotional stability and minimize conflict.

31. The children have long resided primarily with Mother pursuant to the 2022 Order; Mother has been the parent responsible for their day‑to‑day care, schooling coordination, and routine.

32. Maintaining the children’s primary residence with Mother provides continuity and stability in accordance with the factors recognized in Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–844, which emphasize the importance of preserving a stable custodial arrangement that has worked well for the children.

33. Providing Mother with clearer authority over scheduling of the children’s activities during her parenting time will reduce uncertainty and conflict, thereby protecting the children from adult disputes over scheduling.

34. It is in the children’s best interests that each parent be required to schedule extracurricular and similar activities in a manner that:
    a. Respects the existing parenting plan;  
    b. Involves reasonable consultation with the other parent, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31; and  
    c. Avoids placing the children in the middle of disagreements or blaming one parent for conflicting commitments.

35. It is also in the children’s best interests that the Court reaffirm and strengthen the non‑disparagement obligations of the parties and clearly prohibit either parent from making negative or blaming comments about the other parent to or in front of the children.

36. Consistent with cases such as Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 401–403, and Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–740, a parent’s repeated undermining of the other parent’s relationship with the children and disparagement in front of the children may justify modification of custody or parenting time to safeguard the children’s emotional welfare.

37. A clarified custodial arrangement that confirms the children’s primary residence with Mother, together with defined rules about scheduling and non‑disparagement, is necessary to protect the children’s relationship with both parents and to promote their emotional and physical well‑being.

38. The requested modification does not seek to eliminate Father’s relationship with the children but rather to:
    a. Preserve and clarify Mother’s primary physical custody;  
    b. Reduce conflict arising from unilateral activity scheduling;  
    c. Protect the children from harmful disparagement and blame; and  
    d. Promote cooperative and predictable co‑parenting consistent with the statutory mandate that the children’s best interests control. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31.

### VII. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

39. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2022 Order and modify that Order to better serve the best interests of Emily and Jacob.

40. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court enter an Amended Judgment/Order that includes, among other appropriate and just terms, the following:

   **A. Physical Custody / Primary Residence**

   a. That the Court formally confirm and/or modify the existing arrangement to state explicitly that Mother shall have primary physical custody of the minor children, with the children’s primary residence to be with Mother, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31.

   **B. Parenting Time for Father**

   b. That Father’s parenting time be specifically defined and set forth in a clear schedule (e.g., designated weekends, holidays, vacations), with appropriate transition times, to minimize conflict and confusion for the children.

   c. That the schedule make clear that, absent written agreement of the parties, the children shall be with Mother during Mother’s designated parenting time and with Father during Father’s designated parenting time.

   **C. Scheduling of Activities / Decision‑Making**

   d. That, in light of the parties’ difficulties in exercising joint legal custody as to scheduling and extracurricular activities, the Court allocate decision‑making authority such that Mother shall have final decision‑making authority regarding the scheduling of routine, non‑emergency extracurricular and social activities that occur during her parenting time, after good‑faith consultation with Father.

   e. That Father shall not unilaterally enroll the children in regularly occurring activities or events that conflict with Mother’s designated parenting time without Mother’s written consent (which may include email or text), except in bona fide emergencies.

   f.   That both parties be ordered to consult at reasonable times and in good faith concerning major educational, medical, and religious decisions affecting the children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31, and that if the parties cannot reach agreement after good‑faith consultation, Mother shall have final decision‑making authority on day‑to‑day scheduling matters to avoid disruption of the children’s primary residence and routine.

   **D. Non‑Disparagement / Support of Parent‑Child Relationships**

   g. That both parties be expressly ordered not to disparage, demean, or speak negatively about the other parent in the presence or hearing of the children, and not to blame the other parent to the children for disagreements between the parents.

   h. That both parties be ordered to affirmatively support and encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent, consistent with the children’s best interests, and to refrain from conduct that would tend to alienate the children from the other parent. See Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 401–403; Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738–740.

   i.   That both parties be directed not to involve the children in discussions of adult conflicts or court proceedings and not to use the children as messengers between parents.

   **E. Additional Provisions as Justice Requires**

   j.   That the Court may, in its discretion, refer the parties to a parenting education or co‑parenting program approved by the Probate and Family Court, pursuant to its equitable powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6, if the Court deems such an order appropriate to reduce conflict and enhance communication.

   k.   That the Court may enter such additional orders as it deems necessary and proper to implement the modified custodial arrangement and protect the children’s emotional and physical health, including but not limited to clarification of telephone/virtual contact, holiday and vacation schedules, and transportation responsibilities.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2022 custody and parenting time Order, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the cases interpreting that statute, including Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); and Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);

B. Determine that modification of the 2022 Order is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor children, Emily and Jacob, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (as applicable); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834; Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590; Custody of Zia, 455 Mass. 327 (2009); Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); and related precedent;

C. Modify the 2022 Order to confirm and/or award Mother primary physical custody and primary residence of the minor children, with detailed parenting time for Father;

D. Modify the 2022 Order to clarify and allocate decision‑making authority regarding the scheduling of the children’s activities during each parent’s parenting time, as set forth above, including granting Mother final decision‑making authority on day‑to‑day scheduling matters after good‑faith consultation;

E. Enter a clear non‑disparagement and support‑of‑relationship order prohibiting either parent from disparaging the other parent to or in the presence of the children, from blaming the other parent for missed activities or scheduling disputes in the children’s hearing, and requiring both parents to encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent;

F. Order such parenting education, co‑parenting, or other remedial measures as the Court deems appropriate to assist the parties in reducing conflict and protecting the children’s welfare;

G. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the children.
