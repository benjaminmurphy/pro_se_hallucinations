### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
(NEGLIGENCE – PERSONAL INJURY)

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Quincy Bistro LLC (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC (“Defendant”) is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls a restaurant located at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts (the “Premises”).

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This is a civil action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

4. The amount of damages sought by Plaintiff exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and therefore falls within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3.

5. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2 and G.L. c. 223A, § 5 because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, at the Premises located at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, MA.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a business invitee and lawful customer at Defendant’s restaurant located at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, MA.

7. At all relevant times, Defendant, acting through its employees, agents, and/or servants, owned, operated, managed, controlled, inspected, and maintained the Premises, including the interior hallway between the kitchen and the dining area, and owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff, a paying customer lawfully on the Premises.

8. During the evening of August 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was dining at the restaurant, one of Defendant’s servers dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room (the “Hallway”).

9. The dropped tray caused water and ice to spill across the tile floor in the Hallway.

10. The server quickly picked up the broken glass but left the spilled water and ice on the floor, creating a slippery and hazardous condition.

11. The server verbally stated that she would “be right back with a mop,” but did not immediately return with a mop, and did not clean or dry the floor.

12. The server and/or other employees of Defendant failed to place any “wet floor” sign, cone, barrier, or other visible warning device in or around the Hallway after the spill occurred.

13. At no time did any employee or agent of Defendant warn Plaintiff that water and ice had been spilled and remained on the floor in the Hallway.

14. Approximately ten (10) minutes after Plaintiff observed the server drop the tray and heard the server’s statement about returning with a mop, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom.

15. To get to the restroom, Plaintiff was required to walk through the Hallway, which was under the control of Defendant.

16. At that time, the floor in the Hallway was still wet from the earlier spill; water and/or melted ice remained on the tile surface.

17. The water on the tile floor caused a slick, slippery condition. The water was visible only in that it made the floor “glistening,” which Plaintiff reasonably believed was simply the ordinary appearance of the tile flooring.

18. There were no caution signs, cones, barricades, warning tape, or other markings indicating that the floor was wet or unsafe.

19. There were no alternative safe routes provided to access the restroom other than using the Hallway.

20. As Plaintiff proceeded through the Hallway toward the restroom, and when Plaintiff’s foot reached the wet area, her foot slipped out from under her due to the water on the tile floor.

21. Plaintiff lost her balance and twisted her knee as she attempted to catch herself, suffering an immediate onset of pain to her knee.

22. Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries occurred directly within the area where the water and ice had been spilled and left unremedied by Defendant’s employees.

23. After Plaintiff fell, she overheard other staff members of Defendant state, in substance, that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, indicating that the dangerous condition had existed for a significant period of time before Plaintiff’s fall.

24. The statements of Defendant’s employees demonstrated that Defendant, through its employees and agents, had actual knowledge and awareness of the existence of the hazardous puddle in the Hallway and had ample opportunity to remedy or warn of it prior to Plaintiff’s fall.

25. Defendant and its employees failed to take reasonable steps to clean up the water and ice in a timely fashion, to dry the floor, to cordon off the area, to post a warning sign, or otherwise to protect patrons such as Plaintiff from the hazard.

26. Following the incident, Plaintiff experienced significant pain and difficulty walking.

27. Plaintiff promptly sought medical care at an urgent care facility, where she was examined and diagnosed with a sprained knee.

28. Plaintiff was prescribed and fitted with a knee brace and referred for a course of physical therapy.

29. Plaintiff underwent physical therapy for several weeks to treat the knee sprain and related symptoms.

30. Plaintiff incurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses of approximately $1,500 for urgent care, orthopedic follow-up, physical therapy, medications, and related medical treatment.

31. As a direct result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time and/or had to work reduced hours and modified duties, causing her to lose approximately $2,000 in wages.

32. Plaintiff’s knee injury caused her pain and suffering, limitation of mobility, interference with her daily activities and enjoyment of life, and emotional distress associated with the injury and recovery process.

33. Plaintiff continues to experience, to some extent, pain, discomfort, and limitations associated with the knee injury, and may require future medical evaluation and/or treatment.

34. At all relevant times, Defendant owed to Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition, to inspect for hazards, to remedy dangerous conditions of which it knew or should have known, and to warn Plaintiff of non-obvious dangers.

35. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, breached this duty by failing to use reasonable care in the inspection, maintenance, and operation of the Hallway on August 15, 2023.

36. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the injuries and damages described herein.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**

37. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 36 as if fully set forth herein.

**Duty**

38. Under Massachusetts law, a business owner in control of premises open to the public owes a duty of reasonable care to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors, including business invitees such as Plaintiff. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (landowner owes duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743–44 (1995).

39. Defendant, as the owner/operator of the restaurant, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the floors, passageways, and common areas in a reasonably safe condition, and to warn patrons of any dangers of which Defendant knew or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010) (duty to remedy and warn of foreseeable hazards on property); *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 782–83 (2007).

**Breach**

40. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care, including but not limited to in the following ways:

   a. Failing to promptly and adequately clean up the water and ice that had been spilled on the tile floor in the Hallway;

   b. Failing to dry the floor or otherwise remove the slippery condition within a reasonable time after the spill occurred;

   c. Failing to place warning signs, cones, or other devices to alert patrons to the presence of the wet and slippery floor;

   d. Failing to block off or restrict access to the hazardous area until the dangerous condition was remedied;

   e. Failing to implement or follow reasonable policies and procedures for inspection, maintenance, and clean-up of spills in areas used by patrons;

   f. Allowing the dangerous condition (puddle of water and melted ice) to remain for an unreasonable length of time, particularly after Defendant’s employees had actual knowledge of its existence;

   g. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees with respect to responding to known hazards and protecting patrons from slips and falls.

41. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner may be found negligent where it creates a dangerous condition or fails to remedy or warn of a condition that it knew or reasonably should have known about. *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 784–86 (2007); *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

42. Here, Defendant, through its employee, affirmatively created the hazardous condition when the employee dropped the tray of water glasses and left the water and ice on the floor without promptly cleaning it up or warning patrons, thereby establishing Defendant’s notice and responsibility for the hazard. See *Sheehan*, 448 Mass. at 786 (where defendant’s employees create the dangerous condition, the notice requirement is satisfied).

43. In addition, the statements of other staff members that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while evidence Defendant’s actual knowledge of the hazard and that it had existed long enough to permit a reasonable opportunity to correct or warn of it. See *Gallagher v. Stop & Shop, Inc.*, 332 Mass. 560, 563 (1955) (liability where condition existed for sufficient time that employees should have discovered and remedied it); *Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.*, 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

44. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to address a known, obvious hazard in a frequently used passageway constitutes a breach of the duty of care owed to Plaintiff. See *Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 61 (1983) (duty measured by what a reasonable person would anticipate and guard against).

**Causation**

45. Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s slip and fall and resulting injuries. But for Defendant’s failure to clean the spill, to dry the floor, to post warnings, or to block access to the Hallway, Plaintiff would not have slipped and twisted her knee.

46. Plaintiff’s injuries were a reasonably foreseeable and natural consequence of Defendant’s failure to address a wet, slippery floor in an interior hallway used by patrons. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640 (1996) (foreseeability of harm from known dangerous conditions); *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147–48 (2006).

**Damages**

47. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a sprained knee and associated soft‑tissue injuries, necessitating an urgent care visit, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, use of a knee brace, and a course of physical therapy.

48. Plaintiff has incurred, and is reasonably expected to incur, medical expenses for the diagnosis, care, and treatment of her injuries in the approximate amount of $1,500 to date, and may incur additional medical expenses in the future. See G.L. c. 231, § 6D (recovery of reasonable medical expenses for bodily injury).

49. Plaintiff has lost approximately $2,000 in wages due to her inability to work or work at full capacity as a result of her injuries, and may suffer future loss of earning capacity.

50. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer conscious pain and suffering, physical discomfort, inconvenience, and limitations in performing normal activities of daily living.

51. Plaintiff has experienced, and may continue to experience, loss of enjoyment of life and emotional distress associated with the injury, treatment, and resulting limitations.

52. Under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and any future medical costs or loss of earning capacity. See *Fenn v. Mansfield*, 336 Mass. 674, 677 (1958); *Harlow v. Chin*, 405 Mass. 697, 702–03 (1989); G.L. c. 231, §§ 60F, 85.

53. Plaintiff has complied with all applicable laws and conditions precedent, if any, to the filing of this action.
