v.  

HAROLD FINCH,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Miller (“Plaintiff”) states the following complaint against Defendant Harold Finch (“Defendant”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Miller is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.

2. Defendant Harold Finch is an individual who, on information and belief, is the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 (the “Premises”), where Plaintiff resides as a tenant.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for damages pursuant to the Massachusetts covenant of quiet enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. The Premises are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Worcester County; therefore, venue and jurisdiction are proper in the Worcester Division of the District Court Department. See G.L. c. 218, §§ 2, 19.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about August 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.

8. Plaintiff has paid, and continues to pay, monthly rent in the amount of $1,300.00 to Defendant for the Premises.

9. At all times relevant, Plaintiff has occupied the Premises as Plaintiff’s primary residence.

10. As Plaintiff’s landlord, Defendant is subject to and bound by the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment for residential tenants under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

11. Under Massachusetts law, a residential tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment and to an apartment that complies with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and is fit for human habitation. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 239, § 8A; 105 CMR 410.000 et seq.; *Boston Housing Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

12. Approximately three months prior to the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff began to notice mouse droppings in the kitchen area of the Premises on a regular basis.

13. The presence of mouse droppings and rodent activity inside a dwelling unit constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code and a material interference with the quiet enjoyment of the premises. See 105 CMR 410.550 (rodent and insect infestation); *Lipsitt v. Plowboy Realty Corp.*, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 238 (1996) (unsanitary conditions and infestations can constitute breach of quiet enjoyment).

14. Upon first observing the mouse droppings, Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition.

15. In response, Defendant placed a few traps in the Premises, and a small number of mice were caught.

16. Despite these minimal efforts, Plaintiff continued to find fresh mouse droppings in the kitchen on a regular basis, including on counters, floors, and near food storage areas.

17. Defendant stated to Plaintiff, in substance, that the presence of mice and droppings was “normal for older buildings” and suggested that Plaintiff needed to keep the kitchen cleaner.

18. Plaintiff, however, keeps the kitchen and apartment in a clean and orderly condition, including regular cleaning of surfaces, proper storage of food, and timely disposal of trash.

19. Defendant’s implication that the problem was due to Plaintiff’s cleanliness was unfounded, unreasonable, and dismissive of Plaintiff’s legitimate health and safety concerns.

20. Defendant subsequently hired an exterminator to visit the Premises on or about one occasion only.

21. During that visit, the exterminator advised Plaintiff, in substance, that the building likely required more comprehensive treatment and follow-up in order to effectively address the rodent infestation.

22. Plaintiff communicated the exterminator’s recommendation to Defendant and requested additional and more comprehensive extermination measures.

23. Defendant refused to undertake further extermination beyond the single visit, stating that additional treatment was “overkill” and “too expensive.”

24. Since that time, Plaintiff has continued to find mouse droppings in the kitchen on a recurring basis, including at least weekly.

25. The continuing presence of mice and mouse droppings has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the kitchen and the Premises safely and comfortably.

26. Plaintiff has been forced, on multiple occasions, to discard food items in boxes and bags that were not sealed in hard containers, due to contamination or the substantial risk of contamination by rodents and droppings.

27. Over the past several months, Plaintiff has had to throw away approximately $200.00 worth of food as a result of the rodent problem.

28. To mitigate the problem and protect remaining food, Plaintiff purchased plastic storage containers for food items, at a cost of approximately $80.00.

29. Plaintiff has experienced ongoing anxiety, distress, and discomfort about cooking, preparing food, and eating in the kitchen due to the persistent rodent infestation and the presence of droppings.

30. Plaintiff’s concern includes reasonable fears about disease, contamination, and overall unsanitary living conditions in the Premises.

31. Despite repeated notice of the ongoing infestation and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Premises, Defendant has failed and refused to take adequate steps to eradicate the rodent problem or otherwise restore the Premises to sanitary, habitable condition.

32. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s failure to correct serious sanitary code violations and conditions affecting health or safety after notice can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

33. The rodent infestation and persistent droppings violate the State Sanitary Code, including but not limited to 105 CMR 410.550 (requiring a dwelling to be free from chronic rodent infestation and requiring the owner to take all reasonable measures to prevent such infestation).

34. The conditions described above also constitute a material interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 because they:

   a. Substantially impair Plaintiff’s ability to use the kitchen for normal and intended purposes, such as storing, preparing, and consuming food;

   b. Impose health and safety risks due to possible contamination by rodent droppings;

   c. Cause Plaintiff ongoing anxiety, discomfort, and distress in Plaintiff’s home; and

   d. Persisted over an extended period despite notice to Defendant and Defendant’s control over the conditions.

35. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is the natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s acts and omissions, and Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that failure to address the rodent infestation adequately would substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982) (landlord liable for substantial interference with quiet enjoyment where interference is natural and probable consequence of landlord’s acts or omissions).

36. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment has been ongoing for at least several months prior to the date of this Complaint and continues to the present.

37. Defendant’s failure to undertake appropriate and sustained extermination measures, despite the exterminator’s recommendation and Plaintiff’s ongoing complaints, constitutes an unreasonable failure to act to correct conditions interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

38. Plaintiff has at all times acted reasonably, kept the Premises clean, and cooperated with Defendant’s limited efforts to address the infestation.

39. Plaintiff did not cause the rodent infestation and is not responsible for the unsanitary condition; rather, it exists due to circumstances within Defendant’s control and duty as landlord to maintain the building and premises in compliance with applicable health and sanitary codes. See 105 CMR 410.000; *Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 200–01.

40. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to:

   a. The value of food discarded due to contamination or risk of contamination, approximately $200.00;

   b. Out-of-pocket costs for plastic containers and related mitigation measures, approximately $80.00;

   c. Loss of the full value of the rent paid for an apartment that was not sanitary, habitable, or reasonably fit for quiet enjoyment during the period of infestation; and

   d. Anxiety, discomfort, and distress arising from the persistent unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the Premises.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14

41. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth herein.

42. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

43. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is incorporated into every residential tenancy agreement in Massachusetts, regardless of whether it is expressly stated in a written lease. See *Thaxton v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newbury*, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 749, 754 (2003) (describing statutory nature of covenant); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

44. A landlord violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord, or those acting under the landlord’s authority, commits or allows acts or omissions that substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, and such interference is the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s behavior. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–03; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

45. The existence of serious housing code violations and unsanitary conditions, when known to the landlord and left unremedied, may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Al-Ziab*, 424 Mass. at 850–51; *Lipsitt v. Plowboy Realty Corp.*, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 238 (1996); *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. at 198–201; G.L. c. 239, § 8A.

46. The persistent presence of rodent infestation and mouse droppings in Plaintiff’s kitchen and apartment, in violation of the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.550), constitutes a serious and continuing condition affecting health and safety.

47. Defendant had actual notice of the rodent infestation and the continuing presence of mouse droppings for at least several months, beginning when Plaintiff first reported droppings approximately three months prior to this Complaint and continuing thereafter.

48. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take adequate and sustained action reasonably calculated to correct the condition, choosing instead to rely on minimal trapping and a single exterminator visit, and refusing recommended comprehensive treatment on the grounds that it was “overkill” and “too expensive.”

49. Defendant’s failure to abate the infestation and to remedy the unsanitary condition, after notice and over an extended period, constitutes an “indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284–86 (1994) (landlord’s failure to remedy known dangerous condition can constitute interference with quiet enjoyment); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747–48 (2005).

50. Defendant’s acts and omissions have substantially impaired Plaintiff’s ability to use the Premises for their intended residential purposes, particularly the use of the kitchen for safe food storage, preparation, and consumption, and have caused Plaintiff financial loss and emotional distress.

51. The substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was the natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s decision not to follow the exterminator’s recommendation for more comprehensive treatment and Defendant’s refusal to undertake further reasonable measures to address the infestation.

52. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for actual and consequential damages arising from the breach of quiet enjoyment, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

53. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages of at least approximately $280.00 in out-of-pocket losses (discarded food and mitigation supplies), and also has suffered a substantial loss of the value of the rental premises during the infestation period and related distress.

54. Plaintiff estimates that, based on the seriousness and duration of the interference and the rent level of $1,300.00 per month, an appropriate measure of damages would be at least the statutory minimum of three months’ rent, see G.L. c. 186, § 14; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 112–13, together with compensation for Plaintiff’s actual, out-of-pocket expenses.

55. Plaintiff, however, is presently seeking damages in the more modest amount of approximately $280.00, representing out-of-pocket costs directly related to the breach (discarded food and containers), together with any additional relief that the Court deems just and proper under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

56. To the extent applicable, Plaintiff also relies on the remedial principles of G.L. c. 93A, §§ 2, 9 (unfair or deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce), and G.L. c. 239, § 8A (defenses and counterclaims in summary process based on breach of quiet enjoyment and sanitary code violations), not as separate causes of action in this complaint, but as persuasive authorities recognizing the seriousness of sanitary code violations and quiet enjoyment breaches in Massachusetts residential tenancies. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991); *Brown v. LeClair*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976 (1985).


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Harold Finch as follows:

A. Finding and declaring that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. Awarding Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of approximately two hundred eighty dollars ($280.00), or such other and further amount as the Court deems just and proper based on the evidence and applicable law;

C. Awarding Plaintiff costs of this action as permitted by law;

D. Awarding such additional and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.


### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.


Respectfully submitted,
