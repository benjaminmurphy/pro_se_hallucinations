Docket No. ____________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds (“Mother”), and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. JURISDICTION, PARTIES, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. This is a Complaint for Modification brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and the Court’s equitable powers, seeking modification of an existing custody and parenting time order on the grounds of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the minor children.

2. The Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children:  
   - Emily Reynolds, born [month/day/year omitted for privacy] (age 10), and  
   - Jason Reynolds, born [month/day/year omitted for privacy] (age 8)  
   (collectively, “the Children”).

3. The Defendant, Mark Reynolds (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

4. The Middlesex Probate and Family Court (the “Court”) entered a Judgment concerning custody and parenting time on or about May 15, 2021 (the “2021 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2021 Judgment, Mother was awarded primary physical custody of the Children, and the parties share legal custody as set forth in that order. Father was granted parenting time consisting of alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

6. At the time of the 2021 Judgment, neither parent was living with or in a serious, long‑term cohabiting relationship with a romantic partner, and the judgment contained no specific provisions relating to exposure of the Children to a new partner or to supervision of parenting time based on such a relationship.

7. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6; and applicable case law, including *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since entry of the 2021 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children’s safety and welfare while in Father’s care and during his parenting time.

9. Specifically, Father now resides with, and the Children are regularly exposed to, Father’s romantic partner and cohabitant (hereinafter “the Cohabitant”).

10. Upon information and belief, the Cohabitant has a criminal record that includes at least one conviction for assault and battery.

11. Upon information and belief, the Cohabitant has been the subject of at least one abuse prevention order (restraining order) pursuant to G.L. c. 209A, obtained by a previous intimate partner, arising out of allegations of abusive and/or violent conduct.

12. These facts were not known to the Court and did not exist, or were not reasonably foreseeable, at the time of the 2021 Judgment, and they constitute new circumstances that materially alter the context in which Father exercises parenting time.

13. The presence of a household member with a history of violence and a prior abuse prevention order is a material change in circumstances that directly affects the Children’s physical safety and emotional well‑being during visits with Father.

14. Massachusetts law recognizes that a party seeking modification of a custody or parenting order must demonstrate (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the prior judgment, and (2) that modification is in the best interests of the child. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006); *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Scholl v. McLain*, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 273–74 (1984).

15. A parent’s new relationship, and the impact of that relationship and household environment on the child, can constitute such a material change. See, e.g., *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404–05 (1981) (court may consider parent’s living situation and cohabitants in custody determinations); *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1981) (rescript).

16. Here, the material change is amplified by specific incidents that have occurred in Father’s home and in the presence of the Children.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SAFETY AND WELFARE

17. The Children have reported to Mother that the Cohabitant frequently yells in the home, slams doors, and behaves in a loud and intimidating manner while the Children are present.

18. The Children have expressed fear and anxiety to Mother regarding the Cohabitant’s temper and the unpredictable nature of the Cohabitant’s outbursts.

19. On at least one occasion, the Cohabitant grabbed one of the Children by the arm with enough force to leave a visible mark on the Child’s arm.

20. The Child reported that the grabbing occurred in the context of the Cohabitant yelling and being angry in the home.

21. Upon discovering the mark and hearing the Child’s report, Mother reasonably became concerned for the Children’s safety during Father’s parenting time.

22. Mother’s concerns are consistent with the Cohabitant’s documented history of assault and battery and the prior abuse prevention order, indicating a pattern of violent or aggressive conduct.

23. On another occasion, a neighbor of Father’s residence called the police due to a loud and disturbing argument occurring in or around Father’s home while the Children were present.

24. The Children have described this argument as involving significant yelling, door‑slamming, and overall chaos that caused them distress and fear.

25. The involvement of law enforcement during an argument in the Children’s presence further demonstrates that Father’s current household environment, and particularly the Cohabitant’s behavior, pose a risk to the Children’s emotional and physical well‑being.

26. The Children’s exposure to yelling, intimidation, physical aggression, and police intervention constitutes a harmful and inappropriate environment, inconsistent with their best interests under Massachusetts law. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595–96 (1996) (best interests standard includes consideration of emotional security and safety); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840–41 (2003).

27. Massachusetts courts are required to prioritize the safety and well‑being of children in custody and parenting matters. See, e.g., G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 208, § 31A (requiring consideration of effects of abuse); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998).

28. The Children’s reported experiences, combined with the Cohabitant’s criminal history and prior restraining order, establish a substantial and continuing risk of harm to the Children during Father’s parenting time in the presence of the Cohabitant.

29. The continuation of unsupervised parenting time in the presence of the Cohabitant, without any safeguards or restrictions, is not consistent with the Children’s best interests and is contrary to the protective purposes embodied in G.L. c. 209A and G.L. c. 208, § 31A. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96 (history of abuse and risk of harm are central to custody determinations); *Smith v. Joyce*, 421 Mass. 520, 524–25 (1995) (upholding restrictions where necessary to protect child from risk of harm).

30. The current parenting arrangement, as applied to Father’s changed living situation and cohabiting relationship, no longer adequately protects the Children’s safety and emotional welfare.

31. In light of these changed circumstances, modification of the 2021 Judgment is necessary to protect the Children and to serve their best interests.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

32. The controlling standard in custody and parenting time matters is the “best interests of the child.” See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. at 710; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 840–41.

33. In determining the best interests of the child, Massachusetts courts consider, among other things, the child’s safety, the child’s emotional needs, the stability of each parent’s home environment, and any pattern of abuse or violence. G.L. c. 208, §§ 31 & 31A; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96; *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704, 711–12 (1984).

34. The Children are of school age, 10 and 8, and are in a developmental stage where predictability, emotional security, and freedom from exposure to violence and intimidation are critical to their healthy development.

35. Mother’s home has remained stable, safe, and free from physical violence, abuse, or police involvement, and Mother has complied with the 2021 Judgment and supported the Children’s relationship with Father.

36. Mother recognizes the importance of the Children maintaining a meaningful relationship with Father, but such relationship must be balanced against the imperative of ensuring the Children’s safety and emotional security.

37. Massachusetts courts may impose restrictions on parenting time, including supervision or conditions regarding third‑party contact, where such conditions are necessary to protect a child’s best interests and ensure safety. See *Smith v. Joyce*, 421 Mass. at 524–25; *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. at 404–05.

38. Courts have broad discretion to tailor parenting time conditions to address risks posed by third parties in the home, such as prohibiting contact between the child and a particular individual or requiring supervision of visits. See *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (rescript); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 190–91 (1998) (upholding conditions on visitation to protect child).

39. Given the evidence of the Cohabitant’s violent history, the Children’s reported fear and distress, and the police response to a domestic disturbance while the Children were present, permitting unsupervised contact between the Children and the Cohabitant is inconsistent with their best interests.

40. Reasonable modification of the 2021 Judgment—either by prohibiting the Cohabitant’s presence during visits or by requiring supervision of Father’s parenting time when the Cohabitant is present—would preserve the Children’s relationship with Father while prioritizing their safety and emotional wellbeing.

41. Such a modification is narrowly tailored and consistent with Massachusetts law and policy favoring safe, stable, and nurturing environments for children. See *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. at 225; *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. at 711–12.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

42. Mother seeks modification of the 2021 Judgment solely as it relates to the conditions under which Father exercises parenting time, in order to protect the Children from exposure to the Cohabitant’s violent and unstable behavior.

43. Mother does not seek at this time to eliminate Father’s parenting time, but rather to impose reasonable and appropriate safeguards to ensure the Children’s safety and emotional well‑being.

44. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court enter an order providing one or more of the following:

   a. That Father shall not permit the Cohabitant (identified by name and/or description as may be provided in a confidential filing or at hearing) to be present in the home or to have any contact with the Children during Father’s parenting time;  

   OR, in the alternative,

   b. That Father’s parenting time shall be supervised by a neutral third party or at a professional supervised visitation center approved by the Court whenever the Cohabitant is residing with Father or present in the vicinity of Father’s parenting time;  

   AND

   c. That Father shall promptly notify Mother, and if ordered, the Court, of any changes to his residence or household composition, including any new adult cohabitants or romantic partners residing in the home;  

   d. That Father shall not permit any person with a history of assault and battery, domestic violence, or a prior abuse prevention order under G.L. c. 209A relating to intimate‑partner violence to reside in the home or to be in the Children’s presence during his parenting time, absent further order of the Court;  

   e. That the current schedule of alternate weekends and one midweek visit may continue, provided the above safety conditions are met and enforced;  

   f. That the Court may order any additional evaluations, investigations, or services it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) investigation under G.L. c. 215, § 56A, or other assessment of the Children’s safety and welfare; and  

   g. That the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper to protect the Children’s best interests.

45. The requested relief is consistent with the Court’s broad authority under G.L. c. 208, § 28 to modify custody and parenting time orders “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require,” and comports with Massachusetts precedent permitting conditions on visitation to protect a child. See *Smith v. Joyce*, 421 Mass. at 524–25; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. at 190–91; *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. at 595–96.

46. The requested modification responds directly to the material and substantial changes in circumstances that have arisen since the 2021 Judgment, and is necessary to safeguard the Children’s best interests as required by G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant case law.

### VI. STATUTORY AND CASE LAW BASIS

47. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to:

   a. G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of custody and parenting orders upon material change in circumstances and where required for the welfare of the children);

   j. *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (child’s welfare and safety are paramount).

49. Under these authorities, the circumstances described above warrant modification of the existing custody and parenting time order to impose reasonable safety‑oriented conditions.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find and rule that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2021 Judgment, specifically including, but not limited to, Father’s cohabitation with an individual who has a history of assault and battery and a prior abuse prevention order, and the resulting impact on the Children’s safety and emotional well‑being;

2. Modify the existing custody and parenting time provisions of the 2021 Judgment to provide that:
