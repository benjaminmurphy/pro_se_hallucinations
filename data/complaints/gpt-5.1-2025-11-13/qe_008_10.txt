COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Brown (“Plaintiff”), and for her Complaint against the Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Brown (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Unit ___, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02150.

2. Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the residential premises located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Premises”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and was responsible for the maintenance and repair of common areas and security-related building entry doors at the Premises.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought in the Chelsea Division of the Massachusetts District Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because the damages sought are within the jurisdictional limits of this Court and the claims arise under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. Venue in the Chelsea District Court is proper because the rental property that is the subject of this action is located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to these claims occurred within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for an apartment located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150 (the “Apartment”), owned and/or managed by Defendant.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment as her home since June 1, 2022, and has paid monthly rent of approximately $1,500.00 to Defendant.

8. The building at 123 Main Street contains common areas, including a main entryway and common main entry door providing access to the interior of the building, as well as a basement area.

9. At all relevant times, the main entry door to the building has been subject to Defendant’s exclusive control as landlord and is part of the common areas that Defendant is required to maintain in a safe, secure, and code-compliant condition.

10. For at least the last two months prior to the filing of this Complaint, the main entry door lock to the building at 123 Main Street has been broken. Specifically, the lock does not latch properly and the door does not reliably secure; anyone can push the door open without a key.

11. The failure of the main entry door to latch properly has made the building accessible to any member of the public or intruder, and has substantially compromised the security of the building, the mail area, and the Plaintiff’s Apartment.

12. Approximately two months before the date of this Complaint, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the main entry door lock was broken and that the door did not secure properly.

13. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s report and represented that he would fix the lock on the main entry door.

14. Despite this acknowledgment and representation, Defendant failed and refused to repair or replace the broken lock or otherwise secure the main entry door in a timely manner.

15. After her initial complaint, Plaintiff reminded Defendant on at least two further occasions that the main entry door lock remained broken and that the building remained unsecured.

16. Notwithstanding these repeated notices, Defendant did not correct the condition and took no reasonable steps to restore proper security to the main entry door for an extended period of time.

17. In or about the month before this Complaint was filed, while the lock remained broken and the main entry door remained unsecured, one or more unknown persons entered the building without authorization and went through the mail and packages left in the common hallway.

18. As a result of the unauthorized entry and the lack of proper security at the main entry door, multiple tenants, including Plaintiff, had packages stolen from the hallway.

19. Plaintiff had at least one package stolen from the building’s common hallway. The value of the stolen package was approximately $120.00.

20. Plaintiff also began to observe evidence that an unauthorized person was entering and using the basement of the building to sleep or stay overnight, including signs of habitation and personal belongings that did not belong to any tenant known to Plaintiff.

21. The knowledge that unauthorized persons could freely access the building at all hours, rummage through mail, steal packages, and possibly sleep in the basement caused Plaintiff significant fear, anxiety, and loss of a sense of safety in her home.

22. Because Defendant failed to repair the main entry door lock and failed to provide basic building security, Plaintiff was compelled to spend her own money to try to protect herself and her property.

23. Plaintiff purchased and installed a security camera at or near the entrance to her Apartment door, and purchased and installed a better, more secure deadbolt on her Apartment door, at a total cost of approximately $200.00.

24. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the continued security concerns and the thefts, but Defendant responded dismissively and stated, in substance, that Plaintiff was “overreacting” and that the neighborhood was safe.

25. Defendant’s dismissive response, combined with his ongoing failure to repair the main entry door lock despite repeated notice, reflected a willful and knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant and of his obligations under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

26. Defendant has at all relevant times had the ability and the responsibility to repair the main entry door lock and to ensure that the building’s main entry door properly secured so that only tenants and invited guests could enter.

27. Defendant’s failure to repair the main entry door lock, after repeated notice from Plaintiff and in the face of actual thefts and intrusions, created and perpetuated a substantial and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her Apartment.

28. Plaintiff’s reasonable expectation that her home would be safe, secure, and protected from unauthorized intruders has been severely undermined by Defendant’s inaction.

29. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain building security, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Property loss in the amount of approximately $120.00 due to the stolen package;  
   b. Out-of-pocket costs of approximately $200.00 for a security camera and an upgraded deadbolt; and  
   c. Emotional distress, fear, anxiety, loss of sleep, and loss of the peaceful enjoyment and sense of safety in her home.

30. Plaintiff reasonably values her actual, compensatory damages at a minimum of three hundred twenty dollars ($320.00), exclusive of statutory multiple damages, interest, costs, and attorney’s fees where recoverable by statute.

31. Plaintiff has not unreasonably refused Defendant access to repair the main entry door, and at all relevant times has been willing to permit any necessary repair work.

32. The conditions described above have existed for a substantial period of time, have materially affected the safety and habitability of the building and Plaintiff’s enjoyment of her home, and have not been remedied by Defendant despite ample and repeated notice.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

33. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1–32 as if fully set forth herein.

34. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease and tenancy in Massachusetts carries with it a covenant of quiet enjoyment. A landlord may not directly or indirectly interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises by any act or omission and, if he does so willfully or negligently, he is liable for actual and/or statutory damages.

35. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law even if not expressly stated in the lease, and protects the tenant’s right to freedom from serious interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises. See, e.g.:  

   a. *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977);  
   b. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982);  
   c. *Winchester v. O’Brien*, 266 Mass. 33 (1929);  
   d. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994);  
   e. *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

36. The landlord’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment can arise from affirmative acts or from omissions, including a failure to repair conditions substantially interfering with the tenant’s use of the premises after notice. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–20; *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

37. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that serious interferences with safety, security, or habitability, when caused or allowed to persist by the landlord after notice, constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g.:

   a. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284–86 (1994) (failure to provide reasonable security measures may breach quiet enjoyment);  
   b. *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 790–91 (1994) (conditions implicating health/safety support quiet enjoyment claims);  
   c. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850–52 (1997) (landlord liability under G.L. c. 186, § 14 for interference with quiet enjoyment).

38. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or for three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

39. A landlord’s inaction in the face of known dangerous or seriously defective conditions in common areas, including unlocked or insecure exterior doors, has been recognized as an “indirect interference” with quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 284–86; *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 790–91.

40. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, had a duty under the covenant of quiet enjoyment and under Massachusetts law to maintain the common areas and building entry doors in a reasonably safe and secure condition and to take reasonable steps to protect tenants from foreseeable intrusions and harm. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. at 283–86.

41. Defendant was on actual notice that the main entry door lock was broken and that the building was effectively unsecured, yet failed to repair or reasonably secure the door for an extended period.

42. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to secure the main entry door, after repeated notice from Plaintiff and in the face of actual criminal activity (mail tampering and package theft), constitutes at least negligent and, on the facts alleged, willful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her Apartment.

43. The resulting unauthorized entries, thefts from the common hallway, and presence of an unknown person sleeping in the basement were foreseeable consequences of leaving the main entry door unsecured in an urban residential building.

44. Defendant’s dismissive response that Plaintiff was “overreacting,” coupled with his inaction, demonstrates a conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s security concerns and of his obligations as landlord.

45. Defendant’s omissions have substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home by subjecting her to:

   a. Repeated risk of unauthorized intrusions;  
   b. Actual property loss from theft;  
   c. Fear and anxiety about personal safety; and  
   d. The need to incur out-of-pocket expenses to attempt to restore a sense of security.

46. Plaintiff’s loss of property, the cost of mitigation measures (security camera and deadbolt), and her emotional distress and anxiety are direct and proximate results of Defendant’s breach of his duties and of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102–06 (mental anguish compensable under G.L. c. 186, § 14); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. at 983–84.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover, at a minimum, either (a) her actual and consequential damages resulting from Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment, or (b) three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees (if attorney’s fees are incurred), plus interest. See also *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52; *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 790–91.

48. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is approximately $1,500.00. Three months’ rent therefore totals $4,500.00, which is greater than her actual out-of-pocket loss (approximately $320.00). Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to at least three months’ rent as statutory damages if Defendant’s conduct is found to have violated the statute. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. at 718–20.

49. In addition, to the extent applicable, Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate security in the common areas may also constitute a violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including 105 C.M.R. 410.480 and related sections requiring maintenance of egress and building security, which in turn supports the claim for breach of quiet enjoyment and statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. at 790–91; *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. at 850–52.

50. Plaintiff therefore seeks judgment against Defendant for damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Actual and consequential damages, including the approximate $120.00 value of her stolen package and $200.00 in security-related expenditures;  
   b. Statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 in an amount not less than three months’ rent (approximately $4,500.00), or such other amount as the Court deems just;  
   c. Costs of this action, and attorney’s fees if she later retains counsel and such fees are incurred; and  
   d. Pre‑ and post‑judgment interest as allowed by law under G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

B. An award of actual and consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:
