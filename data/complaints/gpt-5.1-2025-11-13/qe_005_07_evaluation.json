This directly matches the proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge.... we decline to perpetuate that distinction where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\""

It then applies that standard to Gem\u2019s persistent failure to remedy repeated, serious flooding despite tenant complaints, and concludes that this conduct constituted interference with quiet enjoyment under \u00a7 14. That directly supports the proposition that a landlord\u2019s persistent failure to respond reasonably to serious ongoing interference can amount to \u201cdirect or indirect\u201d interference under the statute.",

One natural inference from this amendment is that the Legislature meant to abrogate the requirement of specific intent\u2026 In sum\u2026 Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

The court holds that if the landlord effectively \u201cstood idle\u201d despite tenant complaints and available measures to remove wrongdoers, that inaction can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment, to be resolved as a factual question on remand.

The court\u2019s focus is entirely on the proper measure of damages for habitability breaches in subsidized housing.

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"
