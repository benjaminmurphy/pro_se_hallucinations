COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”) states the following complaint against Defendant Thomas Wright (“Defendant”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an adult individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Thomas Wright is, upon information and belief, an adult individual who owns and/or operates the residential rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124, which includes the Premises rented by Plaintiff.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was Plaintiff’s landlord within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and was responsible for maintaining the Premises and building in compliance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code and other applicable laws.


### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action is brought in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 6, which confer jurisdiction over actions and proceedings concerning residential tenancies, violations of the State Sanitary Code, and claims under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Dorchester, a neighborhood of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 185C, §§ 1, 3, 4.

6. The amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional amount of this Court, and Plaintiff seeks actual damages, statutory damages, costs, and attorney’s fees as allowed by law.


### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for a two‑bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent for the Premises is $1,600, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid rent as required or has been ready, willing, and able to pay rent, and has otherwise complied with her material obligations as a tenant.

10. At all relevant times, Defendant retained control over the heating system and was responsible for supplying and maintaining heat to the Premises in accordance with state and local law, including 105 CMR 410.000 (the State Sanitary Code, Minimum Standards of Fitness for Human Habitation).

11. During the winter of 2024–2025, and particularly in or about December 2024 through March 2025, the heating system servicing Plaintiff’s apartment repeatedly malfunctioned.

12. Specifically, the indoor temperature in Plaintiff’s unit would drop to approximately 60°F for several hours at a time, usually in the evenings, on repeated occasions throughout the winter.

13. Massachusetts law, including 105 CMR 410.201 and 410.201(A)(1), requires that the landlord provide and maintain a heating system capable of maintaining a minimum temperature of 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and 64°F between 11:01 p.m. and 6:59 a.m. during the heating season. A sustained temperature of approximately 60°F for several evening hours falls below these minimum standards.

14. Plaintiff complained to Defendant about the lack of adequate and consistent heat on multiple occasions during the winter heating season described above.

15. In response to Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant sent a repair person to the Premises on or about two occasions.

16. After the first visit, the repair person advised that the problem had been fixed. The heat functioned at an acceptable level for approximately one week and then the same problem—temperatures dropping to roughly 60°F in the evenings—recurred.

17. Defendant then sent a second repair person, who informed Plaintiff that the boiler was “old but functional” and that there was not much more that could be done.

18. Despite these limited efforts, the heating system continued to allow the temperature in Plaintiff’s unit to fall below the legal minimums on repeated occasions.

19. Plaintiff continued to experience cold indoor temperatures, especially in the evening hours, over a period of weeks and months during the winter season.

20. At all relevant times, Defendant knew or should have known that the heat in Plaintiff’s apartment was inadequate and in violation of the State Sanitary Code and local housing regulations.

21. Rather than take effective steps to repair or replace the heating system or otherwise ensure that Plaintiff’s apartment was properly heated, Defendant claimed that the heat was “working” because it never went completely out and the building was not “freezing.”

22. Defendant’s position ignored the legal requirement that the heating system maintain specified minimum temperatures, not merely that it operate intermittently.

23. As a direct result of the inadequate heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase and use two electric space heaters to keep the Premises livable.

24. The use of space heaters substantially increased Plaintiff’s electric bills, causing her to incur approximately $150 per month in additional electricity costs over the course of the coldest months.

25. Plaintiff estimates that she incurred at least approximately $450 in additional utility costs over the course of the winter due to the inadequate heat supplied by Defendant’s heating system.

26. Plaintiff also developed bronchitis in or about January 2025. Plaintiff’s medical provider advised that her respiratory illness was likely exacerbated by prolonged exposure to cold indoor air.

27. As a result of this bronchitis, Plaintiff missed approximately three days of work and incurred expenses for medical treatment, including antibiotics and related care.

28. Plaintiff’s total consequential damages, including increased utility charges and medical expenses, are reasonably estimated to be at least $900, exclusive of statutory damages, interest, and costs.

29. The ongoing lack of adequate heat substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, forcing her to bundle in extra clothing, cluster her activities near the space heaters, and avoid parts of the apartment during colder hours.

30. Plaintiff experienced discomfort, stress, and disruption in her daily living as a result of the cold temperatures, the recurring nature of the heating failures, and Defendant’s refusal to take effective corrective action.

31. Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises was thereby substantially and materially impaired.

32. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat, despite notice and opportunity to correct the problem, constituted at least a negligent, if not knowing or willful, interference with Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant under Massachusetts law.

33. Defendant’s conduct occurred during the heating season when adequate heat is essential to habitable conditions and poses significant health implications, particularly in cold weather.

34. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the Premises in compliance with the State Sanitary Code, G.L. c. 186, and the common law implied warranty of habitability, including safe and adequate heat.

35. Defendant’s acts and omissions, as described above, caused Plaintiff to suffer actual and consequential damages and subjected Defendant to statutory liability for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.


### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

36. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1–35 as if fully set forth herein.

37. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord or person acting on the landlord’s behalf is liable if he “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

38. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential tenancy in Massachusetts. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

39. A substantial and persistent failure to provide essential services, including heat, in violation of the State Sanitary Code constitutes an interference with quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 282–283 (1994) (defining interference with quiet enjoyment as acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leased premises); Jiannaras v. Alfant, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 848 (1983) (unreported) (lack of adequate heat can support quiet enjoyment claims).

40. The Housing Court and appellate courts have recognized that violations of the State Sanitary Code, including failure to maintain minimum heat levels, may support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment. See Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196, 200–203 (1979); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 775–777 (1994); Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973).

41. Under 105 CMR 410.201 and related provisions, a landlord must furnish and maintain heat so that the temperature in habitable rooms is at least 68°F between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., and at least 64°F between 11:01 p.m. and 6:59 a.m., during the heating season.

42. Defendant’s repeated failure to maintain these minimum indoor temperatures, resulting in temperatures falling to approximately 60°F for hours at a time on numerous evenings, constituted a violation of the State Sanitary Code and a substantial deprivation of essential services.

43. Defendant had actual and/or constructive notice of the heating problem through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and Defendant’s own repair efforts.

44. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to take effective corrective action to ensure that the apartment met the minimum legal temperature requirements and remained adequately heated.

45. The existence of an “old but functional” boiler, as described by Defendant’s repair person, does not excuse Defendant from complying with the State Sanitary Code or his statutory obligations under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

46. Defendant’s inadequate and ineffective repairs, followed by his assertion that the heat was “working” simply because it had not completely failed, demonstrate at least a negligent indifference to Plaintiff’s rights and the conditions of the Premises.

47. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat, in the circumstances alleged, rises to at least a “negligent or careless” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, for which statutory damages are available. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–852 (1997); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–763 (1979).

48. The repeated, ongoing nature of the heating failures, and Defendant’s knowledge of and failure to remedy those failures, constitutes an “occurrence” or series of occurrences of interference with quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

49. Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home was substantially and materially impaired by the recurring cold temperatures, her inability to comfortably occupy the Premises during evenings, and the need to rely on space heaters for basic warmth.

50. Plaintiff suffered actual damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:  
   a. Increased electric utility bills of approximately $150 per month over several months, reasonably estimated at approximately $450 total;  
   b. Medical expenses, including treatment and antibiotics for bronchitis;  
   c. Lost wages or income due to approximately three days of missed work;  
   d. Discomfort, inconvenience, and loss of the full use and enjoyment of her home.

51. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, where a landlord interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment, the landlord is liable for either three months’ rent or the actual damages sustained, whichever is greater, together with the costs of the action and reasonable attorney’s fees.

52. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,600; three months’ rent is therefore $4,800. Plaintiff’s actual damages, as presently estimated, are approximately $900, exclusive of statutory enhancements, interest, and costs.

53. Plaintiff seeks the statutory remedy of three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, as such amount exceeds her actual damages and is mandatory under the statute upon proof of a violation. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–777 (1994) (statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 are mandatory and not discretionary upon proof of interference).

54. In the alternative, to the extent it provides greater recovery, Plaintiff also seeks actual damages, including consequential damages, and such additional relief as the Court deems just.

55. Plaintiff further invokes related statutory and common-law protections establishing the standards of conduct for landlords, including, without limitation:  
   a. G.L. c. 239, § 8A (allowing tenants to assert breaches of warranty, habitability, and quiet enjoyment as defenses and counterclaims in eviction proceedings);  
   b. G.L. c. 93A, § 2 (unfair and deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce), and the standards articulated in 940 CMR 3.17 regarding landlord‑tenant practices, as interpretive of landlords’ obligations (cited here as background and not as a separate claim);  
   c. The implied warranty of habitability recognized in Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), and its progeny, to the extent such standards inform the scope of the landlord’s duties owed to Plaintiff (cited here as background and not as a separate claim).

56. The foregoing statutory and case authorities confirm that a landlord’s failure to provide adequate heat in violation of the State Sanitary Code constitutes a serious breach of the tenant’s rights and supports liability for interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.


### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Wright, and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14, by failing to provide adequate heat and thereby substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises;

B. An award of statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in the amount of three months’ rent, i.e., $4,800 (3 × $1,600), or such greater or lesser amount as the Court finds just and appropriate under the statute;

C. In the alternative, or in addition to the extent not duplicative, an award of Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, reasonably estimated at not less than $900, including but not limited to increased utility costs, medical expenses, and lost wages arising from Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat;

D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel or incurs such fees, or, if permitted by law, an allowance or consideration of Plaintiff’s self‑representation efforts;

F. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper, including, if necessary, injunctive or declaratory relief to ensure ongoing compliance with the State Sanitary Code and Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.


### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
