  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MICHAEL JENKINS,  
  Defendant.  

------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  
------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins (“Mother”), and respectfully complains against the Defendant, Michael Jenkins (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the parties’ minor children, Sophie Jenkins (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Ethan Jenkins (date of birth: __________, age 6) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Michael Jenkins, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the Children.

3. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, because this Court entered the existing custody and parenting time order, and the parties and the Children reside within the jurisdiction of this Court.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

4. On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a Judgment and/or Order (the “2020 Custody Order”) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the Children.

5. Under the 2020 Custody Order, the Mother has primary physical custody of the Children, and the Children primarily reside with her.

6. Under the 2020 Custody Order, the Father is granted parenting time consisting of:  
   a. Every other weekend; and  
   b. One overnight during the week on a regular weekly schedule;  
   or such substantially similar terms as set forth in the 2020 Custody Order.

7. At the time the 2020 Custody Order was entered, both parties worked regular daytime schedules, and the parenting plan was designed and ordered based upon those then‑existing circumstances.

8. The 2020 Custody Order remains in effect and has not been vacated, superseded, or modified by a subsequent judgment or order of this Court.

### III. JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW

9. This is a Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Court’s general equity powers under G.L. c. 215, § 6, seeking modification of custody and parenting time provisions based on a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the Children.

10. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting time order “as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.” G.L. c. 208, § 28; see also G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

11. The paramount consideration in all custody and parenting time determinations is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

12. Modification requires a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the prior judgment, and that modification be in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).

13. Courts recognize that significant changes in a parent’s employment, work schedule, or ability to personally provide care can constitute a material and substantial change of circumstances warranting review of an existing parenting plan. See, e.g., Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507 (2013); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

14. The Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter to modify custody and parenting time provisions of the 2020 Custody Order.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

15. Since entry of the 2020 Custody Order on or about May 15, 2020, there has been a material and substantial change in the Father’s work schedule and his practical availability to exercise the ordered overnight parenting time.

16. The Father has recently accepted or begun working a new job with overnight shifts, typically from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM, on several nights per week, including on many of the nights when he is scheduled under the 2020 Custody Order to have the Children overnight.

17. As a direct result of his new work schedule, the Father is frequently unable to personally care for the Children during his scheduled overnights.

18. On multiple occasions, the Father has contacted the Mother with little or no advance notice on nights that are supposed to be his overnights, informing her that he is either required to work, has just finished an overnight shift, or is too tired to properly care for the Children.

19. In such situations, the Father has either:  
    a. Unilaterally returned the Children to the Mother’s residence on short notice, expecting the Mother to provide overnight care outside the Court‑ordered schedule; and/or  
    b. Left or proposed to leave the Children in the care of his roommate, an adult whom the Mother barely knows and did not agree to as a caregiver.

20. The Children have reported to the Mother that, on numerous occasions when they are at the Father’s residence, they fall asleep on the couch while the Father “naps” or sleeps after his overnight work shifts, rather than the Father being awake and supervising them.

21. The Father’s overnight work schedule, associated fatigue, and reliance on a roommate or other third parties for care of the Children during his court‑ordered parenting time differ substantially from the circumstances that existed at the time the 2020 Custody Order was entered.

22. These changes in the Father’s employment and actual availability to exercise meaningful overnight parenting time were not contemplated by the Court or the parties when the 2020 Custody Order was established.

23. The Father’s new overnight work schedule and the resulting instability and unpredictability in overnight care constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the Children’s welfare within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, including Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981); and Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507 (2013).

### V. IMPACT ON THE CHILDREN AND BEST INTERESTS

24. The Children, Sophie (age 8) and Ethan (age 6), are school‑aged and require consistent routines, adequate sleep, and stable, attentive adult supervision in order to thrive academically, emotionally, and physically.

25. The Father’s overnight schedule and subsequent fatigue make it difficult or impossible for him to provide consistent, awake, and attentive care during the overnight parenting time currently ordered.

26. The practice of the Children falling asleep on couches while the Father sleeps or naps after overnight work shifts is inconsistent with their need for safe, structured, and adequately supervised home and sleep environments.

27. The Father’s pattern of dropping the Children off with the Mother at the last minute due to his work schedule, or of relying on a roommate whom the Mother barely knows for childcare, increases instability and unpredictability for the Children, and creates stress and confusion regarding who is responsible for their care on any given night.

28. Massachusetts courts have emphasized that a stable, predictable schedule and safe, continuous care are central to the “best interests of the child” analysis. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840–843 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595–596 (1996); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

29. The Court may, and should, consider each parent’s ability to personally care for the Children during his or her scheduled parenting time, including the extent to which the parent must rely on third parties. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 265–266 (2001); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738–739 (1996).

30. The Mother has consistently provided day‑to‑day care for the Children, maintains a schedule and home environment suited to their schooling and age, and is able and willing to provide overnight care when the Father is working or too fatigued to safely supervise the Children.

31. Under G.L. c. 208, § 31, in determining the best interests of the child, the Court considers, among other factors, the child’s past and present living conditions, the child’s relationship with each parent, the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs, and the effect of any proposed change on the child’s stability.

32. The changes in the Father’s work schedule and his diminished ability to provide proper overnight care materially affect the Children’s living conditions and stability and require adjustment of the parenting plan to protect the Children’s best interests.

33. Courts have recognized that when changed circumstances impact a child’s schedule, safety, or consistent care, modification of custody or parenting time is appropriate to realign the order with the child’s best interests. See, e.g.:  

   a. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   b. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   c. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998);  
   d. Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981);  
   e. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996);  
   f. Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001);  
   g. Morales v. Morales, 464 Mass. 507 (2013);  
   h. Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981);  
   i. G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31;  
   j. G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

34. It is in the Children’s best interests that overnight parenting time be structured so that overnights with the Father occur only when he is not working overnight shifts and is reasonably rested and able to remain awake and available to supervise and care for the Children.

35. A modified schedule that limits overnights to times when the Father is off work and available, while preserving his meaningful relationship with the Children, advances the Children’s best interests and is consistent with Massachusetts law favoring frequent and continuing contact with both parents when such contact is in the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 842–843.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

36. The Mother does not seek to diminish the Children’s relationship with the Father, but rather to adjust the parenting plan so that:  
    a. The Children are not left in the care of a parent who is working overnight or too fatigued to safely supervise them;  
    b. The Children are not routinely cared for overnight by third parties in lieu of a parent; and  
    c. The Children have a stable, predictable schedule that aligns with their school and developmental needs.

37. The Mother therefore seeks a modification of the 2020 Custody Order to provide, among other things, that:

   a. The Mother shall remain the primary physical custodian of the Children, and the existing designation of primary physical custody to the Mother shall be confirmed and continued.

   b. The Father’s parenting time shall be modified such that:  

      i. The Father’s overnights with the Children shall occur only on nights when the Father is not scheduled to work an overnight shift (e.g., not working between approximately 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM) and is reasonably rested and able to provide awake and responsible supervision.

      ii. The Father shall provide the Mother with reasonable advance written notice (by text or email) of his proposed overnight schedule with the Children, coordinated with his work schedule, so as to create a stable, predictable parenting plan for the Children.

      iii. On any evening when the Father is scheduled to work an overnight shift, or is otherwise unavailable or too fatigued to care for the Children overnight, the Children shall remain with, or be returned to, the Mother, absent prior written agreement to the contrary.

      iv. The Father shall not delegate routine overnight parenting time to a roommate or other third party in lieu of the Mother, unless: (A) the Mother has given her advance consent in writing; or (B) it is a true emergency consistent with the Children’s safety and best interests.

      v. The existing every‑other‑weekend structure may be retained, but weekend overnights shall be limited to weekends during which the Father is off work overnight and is able to supervise the Children.

      vi. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to create a written parenting time calendar, consistent with the above, so as to minimize last‑minute changes and confusion for the Children.

38. The Mother further requests that the Court enter such additional and further orders regarding legal custody, physical custody, parenting time, transportation, notice, and communication as are necessary to effectuate the modified schedule and to protect the Children’s best interests.

39. The requested modification is reasonable, is narrowly tailored to address the material change in the Father’s circumstances, and is in the Children’s best interests, consistent with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the case law cited above.

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Jenkins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2020 custody and parenting time order, specifically including but not limited to the Father’s new overnight work schedule and reduced ability to personally provide overnight care.

B. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the Children’s best interests.

C. Modify the 2020 Custody Order to confirm that the Mother, Laura Jenkins, remains the primary physical custodian of the Children.

D. Modify the Father’s parenting time to provide that overnights shall occur only on nights when the Father is not working overnight and is reasonably rested and able to provide active, awake care, and to require reasonable advance notice and coordination of his parenting schedule with his work schedule.

E. Order that, on nights when the Father is working overnight or is otherwise unavailable or too fatigued to supervise the Children, the Children shall remain with or be returned to the Mother, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.

F. Prohibit the Father from routinely delegating his overnight parenting time to a roommate or other third party in lieu of the Mother, absent the Mother’s advance written consent or a true emergency consistent with the Children’s safety.

G. Order such additional, supplemental, and/or clarifying provisions regarding transportation, exchange times, notice, and communication between the parties as the Court deems just and proper to promote stability and the Children’s best interests.

H. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LAURA JENKINS,
