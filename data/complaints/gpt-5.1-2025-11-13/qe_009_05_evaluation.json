      "supports_proposition": false,
      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion concerns rent control, security deposits, allocation of responsibility for heat and hot water, and calculation of damages for breach of the warranty of habitability. It does not discuss or apply G.L. c. 186, \u00a714 or the doctrine of breach of quiet enjoyment, nor does it tie substantial defects or utility failures to a quiet enjoyment analysis. Thus, it cannot be cited as authority for the specific proposition about what constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The opinion\u2019s only discussion of conditions is in the context of habitability, not quiet enjoyment: \u201cSeveral violations of the State Sanitary Code\u2026 have existed in the tenant\u2019s apartment\u2026 The judge concluded, however, that most of the conditions had minimal impact on the use and enjoyment of the apartment and that Young had been fairly responsive to the tenant\u2019s requests for repairs.\u201d The court then addresses the measure of damages for breach of the warranty of habitability, not for breach of quiet enjoyment."
