    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  

Plaintiff Jessica Hughes (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Quincy Casual Dining, LLC (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hughes is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Defendant Quincy Casual Dining, LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company which, upon information and belief, owns, operates, manages, and/or controls a casual restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169 (the “Restaurant”).

3. At all relevant times, Defendant, by and through its agents, servants, and/or employees, operated the Restaurant as a place of public accommodation and invited members of the public, including Plaintiff, to enter as paying customers.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and involves a claim for personal injury under Massachusetts common law.

5. Venue is proper in Norfolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2, and/or 8, because the cause of action arose in Norfolk County, at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169, within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about May 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee and paying customer at the Restaurant owned and/or operated by Defendant at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.

7. As a paying customer, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises for the mutual benefit of herself and Defendant.

8. At all relevant times, Defendant, through its employees, agents, and/or servants, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, to remedy and/or warn of unreasonably dangerous conditions, and to prevent foreseeable harm to customers.  
   See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–708 (1973) (abolishing common-law distinctions and imposing general duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors); Tyree v. Boston, 412 Mass. 48, 52 (1992) (landowner must act as reasonable person in maintaining property).

9. On May 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was dining at the Restaurant, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray carrying several glasses of water in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room (the “Hallway”).

10. The dropped tray caused water and ice to spill onto the tile floor in the Hallway, creating a slippery and dangerous condition.

11. The server picked up the broken glass but left the water and ice on the floor, creating and/or leaving a hazardous condition that posed an unreasonable risk of slipping and falling to patrons using the Hallway.

12. The server stated that she would “be right back with a mop” or words to that effect, acknowledging the presence of the dangerous condition and Defendant’s knowledge of it.

13. The server did not, at any time prior to Plaintiff’s fall, place any caution sign, cone, “wet floor” sign, barrier, or other visible warning device in or near the Hallway.

14. The server did not, at any time prior to Plaintiff’s fall, cordon off or restrict access to the Hallway or otherwise warn patrons, including Plaintiff, of the existence of the wet and slippery condition on the floor.

15. Approximately ten (10) minutes after the spill, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom and walked into the Hallway, which was a normal and expected route to the facilities provided for customers.

16. At that time, the water and ice from the earlier spill remained on the tile floor in the Hallway.

17. The water on the tile floor caused the surface to glisten and shine, but, as Plaintiff approached, it reasonably appeared to be the normal sheen of tile flooring in the Restaurant’s lighting rather than a distinct puddle of standing water.

18. As Plaintiff stepped onto the area of the Hallway contaminated with water and ice, her foot slipped out from under her due to the slick, wet surface.

19. Plaintiff lost her balance and twisted her knee violently as she attempted to catch herself to avoid a full fall.

20. Plaintiff immediately experienced significant pain in her knee, difficulty bearing weight, and distress following the slip and twist.

21. After the incident, Plaintiff overheard other staff members of Defendant state that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, or words to similar effect.

22. This statement indicates that multiple employees of Defendant were aware of the existence of the water and ice on the floor for an extended period of time and had consciously avoided the area without taking reasonable steps to correct or warn of the hazardous condition.

23. Defendant’s employees thus had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition for at least several minutes, and in any event for a sufficient time that a reasonably prudent restaurant operator should have remedied or warned of the danger.  
    See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 377–378 (2010) (landowner must act as reasonable person in maintaining property in light of all circumstances); Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–169 (1973) (liability where defendant knew or should have known of hazard and failed to exercise reasonable care).

24. The hazardous condition was created by Defendant’s employee in the course of her work, and Defendant is therefore charged with actual knowledge of the condition and responsible for the employee’s negligent acts and omissions under the doctrine of respondeat superior.  
    See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 322–323 (2002) (employer vicariously liable for negligence of employee acting within scope of employment).

25. Plaintiff did not see any warning sign, cone, “wet floor” sign, tape, or barrier in or around the Hallway indicating that the floor was wet or unsafe.

26. No employee of Defendant verbally warned Plaintiff of the wet floor or advised her to avoid the Hallway or use an alternate route.

27. It was reasonably foreseeable that customers, including Plaintiff, would use the Hallway to access the restroom and that water and ice left on a tile floor would create a substantial risk of slipping and falling.

28. It was reasonably foreseeable that a customer who slipped in the Hallway because of the wet condition could suffer significant bodily injury, including injuries to the knees, legs, back, or other parts of the body.

29. After the incident, Plaintiff promptly sought medical care at an urgent care facility, where she was evaluated and diagnosed with a sprained knee.

30. Plaintiff was prescribed and required to use a knee brace for stability.

31. Plaintiff underwent a course of physical therapy over the following weeks as part of her treatment and recovery from the knee injury.

32. As a direct and proximate result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,500 in medical expenses, including but not limited to urgent care evaluation and treatment, diagnostic services, orthopedic follow-up, the cost of a knee brace, and physical therapy sessions.

33. As a further direct and proximate result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time and/or was restricted in her ability to perform her job duties, resulting in approximately $1,200 in lost wages.

34. Plaintiff continues to experience, at times, pain, discomfort, and limitations in her knee, especially with prolonged standing, walking, or other weight-bearing activities.

35. Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer physical pain, emotional distress, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the injuries sustained in the incident.

36. Plaintiff has acted reasonably and with due care at all relevant times, and any contributory negligence on her part was less than fifty percent (50%), such that recovery is not barred under G.L. c. 231, § 85.

37. All of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused by Defendant’s negligence and breach of its duty of reasonable care in maintaining the premises and in failing to correct or warn of a known and avoidable hazard.

### III. CAUSE OF ACTION  
(NEGLIGENCE)

38. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 37 as if fully set forth herein.

39. Under Massachusetts law, a possessor of land owes all lawful visitors, including business invitees such as Plaintiff, a duty to act as a reasonable person in maintaining the property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances.  
    See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–708 (1973); Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 377–378 (2010).

40. Defendant, as the owner and/or operator of the Restaurant, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, maintenance, inspection, and control of the premises, including the Hallway.

41. This duty included, but was not limited to:  
    a. Reasonably inspecting the premises to identify hazardous conditions;  
    b. Safely cleaning up spilled liquids, water, and/or ice in a timely manner;  
    c. Providing adequate warnings of known or reasonably discoverable hazards;  
    d. Placing proper “wet floor” or caution signs, cones, or barriers when the floor was wet or slippery; and  
    e. Training and supervising employees to promptly remedy and/or warn of hazardous conditions, including spills.

42. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, breached its duty of reasonable care in one or more of the following ways, among others:  
    a. Creating a hazardous condition by allowing water and ice to remain on the tile floor in the Hallway;  
    b. Failing to promptly and adequately clean and dry the area after the spill;  
    c. Failing to place any warning signs, cones, barriers, or other devices to alert Plaintiff and other patrons to the slippery, wet floor;  
    d. Failing to warn Plaintiff verbally of the wet floor and the danger it presented;  
    e. Allowing the hazardous condition to exist for at least ten (10) minutes after the spill, during which time multiple employees were aware of the condition and “dodging” it; and  
    f. Failing to adopt or follow reasonable policies and procedures for promptly addressing spills and hazardous floor conditions in areas used by customers.

43. Defendant had actual knowledge of the hazardous condition through its employee who dropped the tray and through staff who admitted to “dodging that puddle” for some period of time, and in any event had constructive knowledge of the condition through the exercise of reasonable care.  
    See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–169 (1973) (notice may be shown where condition existed long enough such that defendant in exercise of reasonable care should have discovered it); Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 265–266 (1961) (store liable where foreign substance on floor, with evidence of defendant’s knowledge or creation of condition).

44. Because Defendant’s employee created the spill and left the water and ice on the floor, Defendant is charged with knowledge of that condition, and its failure to remedy or warn in a timely and reasonable manner constitutes negligence.  
    See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–785 (2007) (store liable where its mode of operation created reasonably foreseeable risk of foreign substance on floor and injury to customers).

45. The dangerous condition and Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to correct or warn of it made injury to a customer such as Plaintiff reasonably foreseeable.  
    See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101, 105–107 (1978) (foreseeability of harm central to duty and breach analysis).

46. Plaintiff’s slip and resulting knee injury were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts and omissions as described above. But for Defendant’s negligence in leaving water and ice on the tile floor without adequate warning or remediation, Plaintiff would not have slipped and injured her knee.

47. Plaintiff did not have equal or superior knowledge of the dangerous condition compared to Defendant and reasonably relied on Defendant to maintain the premises in a safe condition or to provide adequate warnings.  
    See Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206, 228 (1978) (visitor entitled to assume premises reasonably safe absent notice of danger).

48. To the extent Defendant may argue that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, any such negligence was less than fifty percent (50%) of the total negligence which proximately caused the injury, and Plaintiff’s damages should therefore be diminished only in proportion to any causal negligence attributed to her, not barred, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85.  
    See Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 61 (1988) (comparative negligence reduces but does not bar recovery unless plaintiff’s negligence exceeds that of defendant).

49. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence and breach of its duty of care, Plaintiff has sustained and will continue to sustain the following damages, among others:  
    a. Medical expenses, past and future, including urgent care, diagnostic services, medical evaluations, knee brace, and physical therapy, currently estimated at approximately $3,500;  
    b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200 due to missed work and reduced earning capacity during her recovery;  
    c. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, discomfort, and limitations associated with her sprained knee;  
    d. Mental anguish and emotional distress arising from the incident and its consequences;  
    e. Loss of enjoyment of life and interference with normal daily activities and recreational pursuits; and  
    f. Any additional damages allowed by law, including pre- and post-judgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B.

50. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.
