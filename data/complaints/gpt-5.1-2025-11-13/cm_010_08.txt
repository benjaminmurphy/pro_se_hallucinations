MICHAEL JOHNSON,  
    Defendant.  
---------------------------------------------------------------  
COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20; M.G.L. c. 208, § 31)  
---------------------------------------------------------------  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, self‑represented, and for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting‑time Judgment/Order entered on May 15, 2016, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Mother”), is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the mother of the minor child, Sophia Johnson.

2. The Defendant, Michael Johnson (“Father”), is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is the father of the minor child, Sophia Johnson.

3. The parties are the parents of the minor child:

   - Sophia Johnson, born [DOB intentionally omitted], age 10 (“the Child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court issued the original custody and parenting‑time Judgment/Order on May 15, 2016, in this matter.

5. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting‑time under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, and/or M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions of M.G.L. c. 209B.

6. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the original judgment was issued here and the parties and the Child reside in Massachusetts. See M.G.L. c. 215, § 3; M.G.L. c. 223, § 1.

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT/ORDER

7. On or about May 15, 2016, this Court entered a Judgment/Order concerning legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time of the Child (the “2016 Order”).

8. Under the 2016 Order, the Child’s primary residence was awarded to Father, with Mother having limited parenting time, consisting of limited weekend visitation and one weeknight dinner visit per week.

9. At the time of the 2016 Order, Mother was enrolled in graduate school, living in a small studio apartment without a separate bedroom for the Child, and had a non‑flexible academic and work schedule, all of which the Court took into account in fashioning the original parenting plan.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2016 Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances affecting the best interests and welfare of the Child, such that modification of custody and parenting time is warranted under Massachusetts law. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20.

11. Mother has completed her graduate education and now has a stable, long‑term job with regular, predictable, and family‑friendly hours, allowing her to provide consistent care and supervision for the Child.

12. Mother now resides in a safe, stable two‑bedroom apartment, where the Child has her own bedroom, appropriate sleeping arrangements, and a suitable environment for homework, rest, and play, in contrast to the studio apartment situation at the time of the 2016 Order.

13. Mother’s improved housing and employment conditions eliminate the primary reasons the Court initially limited her parenting time and primary residential responsibilities, and thus constitute a material change in circumstances directly relevant to the Child’s well‑being. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).

14. Over the past several years, Mother and the Child have developed a very close, secure, and loving relationship. The Child is now ten years old and has expressed a strong, consistent desire to spend more time and more overnights with Mother.

15. The Child is engaged in therapy and, according to her therapist, experiences guilt and emotional distress when her visits with Mother are short and when she must leave Mother’s home after limited time, indicating that the current schedule is causing unnecessary emotional strain.

16. The Child has written a letter to the Court expressing her wish to have additional overnights and extended time with Mother, reflecting her maturing preferences and her understanding of the current parenting schedule.

17. The Child’s evolving preferences, given her age and maturity, are an appropriate and important consideration in determining her best interests. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266 (2001) (child’s wishes may be considered in custody determinations); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 225–26 (1998).

18. Father has refused to meaningfully discuss any modification of the parenting schedule and becomes angry when the Child raises the issue of wanting more time with Mother, causing the Child additional emotional discomfort and making cooperative co‑parenting more difficult.

19. Father’s refusal to engage in reasonable discussions about an age‑appropriate modification of parenting time, despite Mother’s greatly improved circumstances and the Child’s clearly expressed wishes, demonstrates that the existing arrangement is no longer functioning in the Child’s best interests.

20. The Child’s needs have changed significantly as she has grown from a four‑year‑old preschooler at the time of the 2016 Order to a ten‑year‑old elementary school student, requiring increased emotional support, academic support, and time with both parents. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402–03 (1981) (recognizing that children’s needs change with age).

21. Mother is now fully able to share in the Child’s day‑to‑day care, schoolwork, medical appointments, extracurricular activities, and social development in a way that was not possible at the time of the 2016 Order due to her then‑existing academic and housing constraints.

22. The combination of: (a) Mother’s completion of her education; (b) Mother’s stable employment with normal hours; (c) Mother’s stable two‑bedroom residence where the Child has her own room; (d) the strengthened emotional bond between Mother and the Child; (e) the Child’s clearly expressed and consistent desire for more time and overnights with Mother; and (f) the emotional distress the Child experiences under the current, limited schedule, constitutes a substantial and material change in circumstances since May 15, 2016.

23. These material changes were not and could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the 2016 Order, thereby satisfying the legal standard for modification. See Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366, 368–69 (1981); Katz v. Katz, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 477–78 (2002).

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

24. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 31, and related case law, the paramount consideration in any custody and parenting‑time determination is the best interests of the child. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996).

25. In determining best interests, the Court may consider, among other factors: the child’s past and present relationship with each parent; each parent’s ability to meet the child’s needs; the stability of each household; the child’s emotional ties; the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community; and, where appropriate, the child’s preferences. See M.G.L. c. 208, § 31; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191–92 (1998); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003).

26. Mother is presently able to provide a stable, nurturing home, with a regular routine, appropriate supervision, educational support, and emotional care for the Child, consistent with the Child’s age, developmental needs, and preferences.

27. Increased parenting time and overnights with Mother would strengthen the Child’s relationship with Mother and better support the Child’s emotional health, sense of security, and overall development.

28. Maintaining the current, highly limited parenting‑time schedule, which was crafted for circumstances that no longer exist, unnecessarily restricts the Child’s relationship with Mother and causes the Child emotional distress, which is contrary to the Child’s best interests. See Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635, 641–42 (1999) (emphasizing the importance of fostering relationships with both parents where appropriate).

29. A modified schedule that provides the Child with more frequent and meaningful contact, including regular overnights with Mother, will better serve the Child’s welfare while still preserving a strong relationship with Father and continuity in the Child’s life.

30. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and § 31, and cases such as Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), and Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the Court has broad discretion to modify custody and parenting time when a material change of circumstances has occurred and the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. That standard is satisfied here.

31. The requested modification does not seek to disrupt the Child’s schooling or to interfere with the Child’s relationship with Father; instead, it seeks to provide a balanced, developmentally appropriate schedule that reflects the reality of Mother’s current stability and the Child’s current needs and expressed wishes.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

32. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the May 15, 2016 Order, and that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the Child.

33. Mother specifically requests that the Court:

   a. Modify the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions to provide Mother with significantly increased parenting time, including regular overnights, such that the Child has substantial, frequent, and continuing contact with Mother;  

   b. Establish a specific parenting schedule that, at a minimum, includes:  
      (i) alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m.) through Monday morning school drop‑off (or 9:00 a.m. on non‑school days); and  
      (ii) at least one, and preferably two, mid‑week overnights with Mother during the school week, as the Child’s school and activity schedule reasonably permits;  

   c. Allocate holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time in a manner that provides the Child with meaningful and roughly equal opportunities to spend time with both parents;  

   d. Confirm that both parties shall share in major decisions affecting the Child’s education, medical care, and emotional well‑being, consistent with the Child’s best interests, and that each parent shall foster the Child’s relationship with the other parent;  

   e. Order such further specific provisions as the Court deems necessary to reduce conflict, promote cooperative co‑parenting, and support the Child’s emotional health, including, if appropriate, requirements regarding communication between the parents concerning the Child; and  

   f. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect and promote the best interests of the Child.

### VII. LEGAL BASIS

34. Mother brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to:

   - M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (modification of custody and related orders based on material change in circumstances and best interests of the child);  
   - M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 (definitions and standards for legal and physical custody; best interests of the child);  
   - M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (modification of custody and support orders for children born out of wedlock, if applicable);  
   - M.G.L. c. 209B (Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act); and  
   - Applicable Massachusetts case law, including but not limited to:  

     a. Schuler v. Schuler, 382 Mass. 366 (1981) (material change standard for modification);  
     b. Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (change in circumstances relevant to parenting arrangements);  
     c. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (best interests analysis and stability);  
     d. Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (best interests of child as paramount concern);  
     e. Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998) (factors relevant to best interests);  
     f. Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635 (1999) (importance of children maintaining relationships with both parents);  
     g. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (best interests and consideration of child’s welfare);  
     h. Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (consideration of child’s preferences);  
     i. Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (court’s discretion in custody/parenting‑time modification); and  
     j. Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (best‑interests framework in custody‑related changes).

35. Under these authorities, the Court is empowered and obligated to revise custody and parenting‑time orders when, as here, the circumstances underlying the original judgment have materially changed and a new arrangement is necessary to serve the Child’s best interests.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Determine that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the May 15, 2016 Judgment/Order regarding custody and parenting time of the minor Child, Sophia Johnson;

B. Modify the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions to provide Mother with substantially increased parenting time, including regular overnights, in accordance with the Child’s best interests;

C. Adopt a detailed, written parenting schedule that, at a minimum, provides Mother with alternating weekends from Friday after school (or 5:00 p.m.) through Monday morning (or 9:00 a.m. on non‑school days), and at least one to two mid‑week overnights during the school week, plus an equitable division of holidays, school vacations, and summer time;

D. Order that both parents share in major decisions concerning the Child’s health, education, and welfare, and that each parent encourage and support the Child’s relationship with the other parent;

E. Enter any additional orders that may be necessary to facilitate cooperative co‑parenting and to minimize conflict in the Child’s presence;

F. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper to promote and protect the best interests of the minor Child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
EMILY JOHNSON
