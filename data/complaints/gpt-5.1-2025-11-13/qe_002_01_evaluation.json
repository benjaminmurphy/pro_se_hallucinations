      "support_reasoning": "The quoted portion of Blackett v. Olanoff discusses constructive eviction and breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment based on landlord control over noise from a commercial lounge. It does not mention or apply G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14; G.L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 127A, 127B, 127H; or 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq. Thus, while it is relevant precedent on common-law quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction, it does not provide authority for the statutory and regulatory proposition as framed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge.\u201d"
