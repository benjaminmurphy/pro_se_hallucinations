      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does affirm that the controlling principle in custody matters is the welfare of the child and that the probate judge has broad discretion in custody decisions, referencing G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 28 for future modification. However, it does not discuss G.L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, does not frame the authority as \u2018broad equitable\u2019 power under those statutes, and does not address adjusting a 50/50 schedule to a primary\u2011residence arrangement while preserving parenting time. Instead, it upholds an order granting sole custody to the father and stepmother with no visitation for the mother, which is materially different from the specific proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe governing principle by which the court must be guided in deciding the issues raised is the welfare of the child\u2026 In providing for the custody of a minor child\u2026 the happiness and the welfare of the child should be the controlling consideration. It is the duty of the judge to consider the welfare of the child in reference not merely to the present, but also to the probable future, and it is a subject peculiarly within the discretion of the judge.\u2026 As to the circumstances in which orders for the custody of minor children may be subject to future modification by the court see G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 30\u2026\u201d}"
