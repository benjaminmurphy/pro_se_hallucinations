COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(Physical Custody / Parenting Time)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson (“Mother”), self‑represented, and respectfully complains and alleges as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of one minor child:

   - Ethan Johnson, date of birth: [withheld], age 8 (hereinafter “Ethan” or “the minor child”).

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters concerning legal and physical custody, parenting time, and support of the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 3, as the prior custody and parenting‑time judgment was issued by this Court on April 15, 2018.

5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court because the prior judgment was entered in this Court and the child presently resides within the jurisdiction of this Court. See G.L. c. 215, § 3; G.L. c. 223A, § 3.

6. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the Court’s inherent equity powers to revise and alter custody and parenting orders when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification is necessary in the best interests of the child. See, e.g., *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

### III. PRIOR JUDGMENT

7. On or about April 15, 2018, this Court entered a Judgment (or Temporary Orders later incorporated into a Judgment) establishing legal and physical custody and parenting time for the minor child, Ethan Johnson (the “2018 Judgment”).

8. Under the 2018 Judgment, Mother was awarded primary physical custody of Ethan.

9. Under the 2018 Judgment, Father was granted three short mid‑week visits plus one Sunday afternoon visit each week, with no overnights, based in large part on Father’s then‑existing housing situation—a single room in a shared apartment with roommates and no separate bedroom or appropriate sleeping space for the child.

10. The 2018 Judgment reflected the circumstances of the parties and the minor child when Ethan was approximately three years old, not yet in full‑time school, and when Father’s home environment did not yet allow for suitable overnight parenting time.

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

11. Since entry of the 2018 Judgment, there have been material and substantial changes in circumstances, as recognized by Massachusetts law, such that the existing parenting‑time schedule is no longer in the minor child’s best interests. See *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. 105, 112 (2009) (modification requires showing of “material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties” and that modification is in the child’s best interests); *Cooper v. Keto*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 802–03 (2013) (same).

12. Ethan is now eight (8) years old and attends school full time. His daily schedule, educational needs, extracurricular activities, and developmental needs are significantly different from when he was three years old.

13. Father’s housing situation has substantially and favorably changed: Father now has his own apartment, which is stable and suitable for a child and includes a separate bedroom specifically for Ethan.

14. The principal reason why the 2018 Judgment denied overnights with Father—namely, that Father had only a single room in a shared apartment with roommates and no appropriate sleeping arrangements for the minor child—no longer exists.

15. Under the current order, Ethan is subject to three short mid‑week visits and one Sunday afternoon visit with Father, all non‑overnight, which result in frequent, brief transitions between the parents’ homes.

16. These frequent short visits on school nights require Ethan to be transported back and forth multiple times per week, causing disruption to his homework, extracurricular activities, evening routines, and bedtime, and make it more difficult for both parents to maintain consistent structure and routines for the child.

17. The current schedule was appropriate when Ethan was very young and not in full‑day school, but it has become impractical and unnecessarily disruptive as Ethan has entered school age and has increased academic, social, and rest needs. See *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619, 625–26 (2000) (best‑interests determination must consider child’s age and developmental needs).

18. Ethan has repeatedly expressed a desire to have actual sleepovers and overnight parenting time at Father’s home, where he now has his own bedroom and personal space. While a child’s wishes are not controlling, they are a relevant factor when considering the child’s best interests, particularly as the child grows older. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 616–17 (1987) (child’s preferences may be considered among many factors).

19. Mother and Father both agree that the current schedule is no longer working well for Ethan and that a modification is necessary to better accommodate Ethan’s age, full‑time school schedule, need for stability, and desire for a meaningful relationship with each parent. An agreed‑upon change in parenting time, when consistent with the child’s best interests, is an appropriate basis for modification. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 815–16 (1981).

20. Mother acknowledges that Father has consistently exercised his parenting time, maintained a positive relationship with Ethan, and has made improvements in his living situation and stability since the entry of the 2018 Judgment.

21. The conditions and assumptions that formed the basis of the 2018 Judgment—primarily, Father’s limited and unsuitable housing and Ethan’s very young age and lack of school obligations—have materially changed, and the present circumstances warrant revision of the parenting‑time arrangement. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 547–48 (2010) (material change may be shown where assumptions underlying earlier order have significantly changed).

22. Continuing to enforce the 2018 Judgment without modification subjects Ethan to an unnecessarily fragmented, exhausting schedule that is no longer aligned with his best interests, his schooling, or his expressed wish for extended and overnight time with Father. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494–95 (2012) (paramount consideration is best interests of the child).

23. By contrast, establishing a more age‑appropriate schedule that includes regular overnight parenting time with Father and reduces the number of short mid‑week transitions will promote Ethan’s stability, rest, academic success, emotional well‑being, and his relationship with each parent, and will better serve his overall best interests. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843–44 (2003) (courts seek arrangements that provide stability and continuity while fostering child’s relationship with both parents); *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1981) (modification appropriate where change promotes child’s welfare).

24. Under Massachusetts law, this Court has broad equitable authority to revise and alter custody and parenting‑time provisions when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification is required to serve the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 181–82 (2006); *Schuh v. Schuh*, 453 Mass. at 112.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

25. The proposed modification is sought solely to promote the best interests and welfare of Ethan, consistent with Massachusetts law, which holds that the “overriding and paramount concern” in any custody or parenting‑time determination is the best interests of the child. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. at 494–95.

26. An updated parenting plan that provides for regular, predictable overnight parenting time with Father will:

   a. Reduce the number of disruptive, short, mid‑week exchanges on school nights;

   b. Allow both parents to implement consistent homework, bedtime, and morning routines;

   c. Better support Ethan’s full‑time school schedule and need for adequate rest;

   d. Afford Ethan meaningful, quality, and extended time with Father in a now‑suitable home environment, including the ability to have his own room and belongings at Father’s home;

   e. Reflect Ethan’s growing maturity and his expressed desire for sleepovers at Father’s home; and

   f. Maintain Mother’s primary physical custody while expanding Father’s overnights in a way that promotes stability and continuity for Ethan.

27. The proposed modification does not seek to diminish Ethan’s relationship with either parent; rather, it is designed to better balance and structure that relationship in a developmentally appropriate and logistically feasible manner, consistent with *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843–44, and *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. at 625–26.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

28. Mother respectfully requests that the Court find that:

   a. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the April 15, 2018 Judgment, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant case law (*Schuh v. Schuh*, *Cooper v. Keto*, *Smith v. McDonald*); and

   b. It is in the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Johnson, for the existing custody and parenting‑time provisions to be modified accordingly.

29. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court:

   a. Confirm that Mother shall remain Ethan’s primary physical custodian (unless the Court determines, after hearing, that a different arrangement better serves Ethan’s best interests);

   b. Enter an order establishing a revised parenting‑time schedule for Father that includes regular, reasonable overnights, taking into account Ethan’s school schedule and activities. By way of example (subject to the Court’s determination), such schedule could include:

      i. One or more weeknight overnights during the school week, with Father responsible for school drop‑off the following morning; and/or  
      ii. Alternating weekends from Friday after school (or at a set time) through Sunday evening (or Monday morning return to school), with appropriate consideration of holidays, school vacations, and summers;

   c. Eliminate or reduce the current three short mid‑week, non‑overnight visits in favor of fewer but longer blocks of parenting time that better support Ethan’s rest and school responsibilities;

   d. Establish any additional provisions the Court deems appropriate to ensure consistent homework, bedtime, transportation, and communication arrangements between the parents, including but not limited to:

      i. Clear exchange times and locations;  
      ii. Provisions for school‑related communication and access to school records, in accordance with G.L. c. 71, § 34H; and  
      iii. Any other terms that promote Ethan’s stability, continuity, and well‑being.

30. To the extent necessary, Mother also requests that the Court revise the language of the 2018 Judgment to remove or update any findings or provisions premised on Father’s former shared‑room housing situation and the child’s preschool‑age status, as those facts have materially changed.

31. Mother further requests that this Court enter any additional orders that it deems just and proper to effectuate the modified custody and parenting‑time arrangement in Ethan’s best interests, consistent with the Court’s authority under G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 215, § 6; and applicable case law (*Mason v. Coleman*; *Custody of Kali*; *Custody of Vaughn*).

### VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Accept and docket this Complaint for Modification;

2. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the April 15, 2018 Judgment concerning the custody and parenting‑time arrangements for the minor child, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling Massachusetts case law;

3. Determine, after hearing, that modification of the existing parenting‑time order is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ethan Johnson;

4. Enter a Modified Judgment that:

   a. Confirms Mother as the primary physical custodian (unless modified by agreement or further order of the Court);  

   b. Grants Father a reasonable and regular schedule of overnight parenting time, including but not limited to:

      i. Regular weeknight and/or weekend overnights geared to Ethan’s school schedule; and  
      ii. An allocation of holidays, school vacations, and summer parenting time that is in Ethan’s best interests;

   c. Reduces or replaces the current three short mid‑week, non‑overnight visits with fewer, longer, and developmentally appropriate parenting blocks that minimize unnecessary transitions on school nights;

   d. Includes any additional provisions the Court considers appropriate regarding exchanges, transportation, communication, homework, bedtime routines, and access to school and medical information, to support Ethan’s stability and welfare;

5. Order that all prior inconsistent custody and parenting‑time provisions of the April 15, 2018 Judgment be superseded and replaced by the Modified Judgment;

6. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor child.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
LISA THOMPSON,
