COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME)  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson (“Mother”), and complains against the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), and states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the Mother of the minor children, Emily Johnson (date of birth: __________, age 8) and Noah Johnson (date of birth: __________, age 6) (collectively, “the Children”).

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in or within the jurisdiction of Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the Father of the Children.

3. This action is brought in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, §§ 10, 20; and G.L. c. 215, § 6 to modify an existing custody and parenting-time order based on a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare and best interests of the Children.

4. On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a Judgment (or Order) regarding legal custody, physical custody, and parenting time for the minor Children (the “2020 Judgment”).

5. Under the 2020 Judgment, Mother was awarded primary physical custody of the Children, and Father was awarded parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

6. At the time the 2020 Judgment was entered, neither party was in a serious relationship or cohabiting with another adult, and no specific provisions were made addressing the involvement of new romantic partners or other adults in the Children’s lives.

7. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter and over the custody and welfare of the Children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209B.

### II. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. Since the entry of the 2020 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the prior order, including but not limited to Father’s current cohabitation with a new partner who has a documented history of violence, criminal conduct, and involvement with the courts.

9. Upon information and belief, Father now resides with an adult partner (hereafter “the Cohabitant”), who has a criminal record for assault and battery and has previously been the subject of a restraining order obtained by a former girlfriend, pursuant to G.L. c. 209A.

10. The existence of the Cohabitant’s criminal record for assault and battery, and history of being subject to a restraining order, constitutes new information and a new circumstance that did not exist, was not known to the Court, and was not taken into account at the time of the 2020 Judgment.

11. The Children have reported that, during Father’s parenting time at the residence shared by Father and the Cohabitant, the Cohabitant frequently yells, slams doors, and engages in loud, angry, and intimidating behavior in the Children’s presence.

12. On at least one occasion, one of the Children reported that the Cohabitant grabbed the Child’s arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark.

13. The Child’s report of being grabbed hard enough to leave a mark is consistent with physical discipline or aggression that is excessive, inappropriate, and potentially abusive.

14. The Children have expressed fear, discomfort, and anxiety about the Cohabitant’s behavior during Father’s parenting time.

15. On at least one occasion, a neighbor, upon hearing a loud and disturbing argument while the Children were present in the residence where Father and the Cohabitant live, called the police, and law enforcement responded to the home.

16. The involvement of law enforcement at Father’s residence during an incident of loud conflict while the Children were present further demonstrates the volatility and instability of the environment in which the Children are required to spend time during Father’s parenting time.

17. The circumstances described above – including the Cohabitant’s criminal history for assault and battery, prior restraining order, reported physical aggression toward one of the Children, frequent yelling and door slamming, and a police response to a loud argument in the Children’s presence – constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances since the 2020 Judgment.

18. These new circumstances directly implicate the safety, emotional stability, and overall well-being of the Children and therefore satisfy the threshold requirement for modification under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law.

### III. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

19. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time determination is the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

20. In determining the best interests of the Children, this Court must consider whether the Children’s current parenting-time arrangement exposes them to a risk of harm, instability, or domestic conflict. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 208, § 31A; Adoption of Jill, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 491 (1998).

21. The presence of a household member with a history of assault and battery and a prior restraining order, coupled with reports of yelling, physical aggression, and a police response to a domestic disturbance, raises serious concerns about the safety and stability of the Children’s environment during Father’s parenting time.

22. Massachusetts courts have recognized that exposure to domestic violence and volatile or aggressive behavior in a household can be profoundly harmful to children and is a significant factor in determining their best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (emphasizing protection of children from domestic violence); Care & Protection of Lillith, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 132 (2004).

23. Even where a child is not the direct target of physical violence, exposure to yelling, intimidation, and physical aggression is detrimental to the child’s emotional well-being and can justify restrictions on contact or conditions on parenting time. See Adoption of Olivette, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 141 (2011); Petition of the Dep’t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, 399 Mass. 279 (1987).

24. G.L. c. 208, § 31A specifically directs courts to consider evidence of a “pattern or serious incident of abuse” when making custody determinations, including abuse against a household member. While the present Complaint does not seek a change in legal custody, it requests the Court to adjust parenting-time conditions in light of evidence of potentially abusive or unsafe conduct by the Cohabitant in the Children’s presence.

25. Massachusetts law permits modification of custody and parenting time when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. G.L. c. 208, § 28; see also Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

26. Under Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010), the Court must consider both (a) whether a material change has occurred, and (b) whether the requested change will advance the child’s best interests.

27. The deterioration of the Children’s emotional sense of security and the introduction of a potentially abusive adult into their caregiving environment constitutes a material change affecting their welfare, satisfying the standard for modification articulated in cases such as Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), and Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016).

28. In Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. at 843–44, the Supreme Judicial Court reaffirmed that modification is appropriate when the current arrangement has become harmful or inappropriate for the child due to new circumstances arising after the original judgment.

29. The requested modifications here – to require that the Cohabitant not be present during the Children’s parenting time with Father, or alternatively, to impose supervised parenting time – are narrowly tailored, reasonable protective measures that serve the Children’s best interests by reducing their exposure to potentially unsafe and frightening conditions while preserving an ongoing relationship with Father.

30. Massachusetts courts have broad equitable powers to craft conditions on parenting time that protect children while maintaining parent–child relationships. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).

31. The requested relief is consistent with the principle that the noncustodial parent’s access may be limited or conditioned when necessary to protect a child’s safety and welfare. See Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981).

32. Requiring that Father’s parenting time occur in the absence of the Cohabitant, or under supervision if Father chooses to maintain his current living situation, is a reasonable and measured response to the present risk; it does not terminate Father’s relationship with the Children, but instead provides safeguards to ensure that relationship can continue in a healthier, more secure manner.

33. Given the Children’s young ages (8 and 6), their developmental vulnerability, and their reported fear and discomfort, it is in their best interests that the Court modify the existing parenting-time provisions to address the risks associated with Father’s current household.

### IV. LAW SUPPORTING MODIFICATION

34. G.L. c. 208, § 28 authorizes the Court, upon a complaint after a prior judgment, to “make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children,” if a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred and modification is in the best interests of the children.

35. The standard for modification of custody and parenting time under G.L. c. 208, § 28 has been articulated in multiple appellate decisions, including:

   a. Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (requiring a material and substantial change and a showing that modification is in the child’s best interests);  
   b. Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (two-part test: material change plus best interests);  
   c. Rosen v. Rosen, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 677 (2016) (material change can include new information about home environment and stability);  
   d. Bercume v. Bercume, 428 Mass. 635 (1999) (the child’s welfare is paramount and may outweigh parental preferences);  
   e. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996) (domestic violence and safety are important factors in custody determinations).

36. G.L. c. 208, § 31, and cases construing it, make clear that the Court must focus on the “happiness and welfare” of the child and consider the family’s circumstances as they exist at the time of the modification hearing, not solely as they existed at the time of the original order. See also Murray v. Super, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).

37. G.L. c. 208, § 31A requires the Court, in cases involving abuse, to consider evidence of abuse toward a family or household member and to fashion custody and visitation orders that protect the safety and well-being of the child and the abused parent.

38. Although the present Complaint does not allege that Father himself has a criminal record for assault and battery or has been the subject of a restraining order, the Cohabitant’s criminal history and the Children’s exposure to the Cohabitant’s aggressive behavior and police-involved incidents create a domestic environment that the Court must consider under § 31 and § 31A.

39. Massachusetts appellate decisions emphasize that even when abuse is directed toward someone other than the child, the child’s exposure to that environment is relevant to custody and visitation decisions. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Adoption of Larry, 434 Mass. 456 (2001); Care & Protection of Lillith, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 132 (2004).

40. The Probate and Family Court is authorized to impose conditions on parenting time, including supervised visitation or restrictions on the presence of particular adults, to protect the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 215, § 6; Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232 (1981); Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).

41. In Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619 (2000), the Supreme Judicial Court recognized the Court’s authority and responsibility to restrict or condition a parent’s contact with a child where necessary to prevent psychological or physical harm to the child.

42. The presence of an adult in the home with a prior criminal conviction for assault and battery and a past restraining order is an appropriate subject of judicial scrutiny in a modification proceeding, given its direct implication for the Children’s safety and emotional security.

43. Under these statutes and cases, the Court is fully empowered to modify parenting-time provisions to (a) prohibit the Cohabitant from being present during the Children’s parenting time with Father; and/or (b) require that Father’s parenting time be supervised until the Court is satisfied that the Children’s safety can be adequately protected in an unsupervised setting.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS

44. Mother does not seek to terminate Father’s relationship with the Children or to unreasonably restrict contact, but rather seeks targeted, reasonable modifications necessary to protect the Children from potential harm and to ensure the stability and security of their environment during Father’s parenting time.

45. Mother respectfully requests that this Court find that:

   a. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since entry of the 2020 Judgment, including Father’s cohabitation with the Cohabitant who has a criminal record for assault and battery, a history of being subject to a restraining order, and a pattern of aggressive behavior in the Children’s presence, including at least one incident of physical aggression toward one of the Children and an incident requiring a police response; and  

   b. It is in the best interests of the Children that the existing parenting-time provisions be modified to protect them from exposure to such conduct.

46. Specifically, Mother requests that the Court modify the 2020 Judgment as follows:

   a. That Father’s parenting time with the Children shall occur only when the Cohabitant is not present in the home or in the Children’s physical proximity;  

   b. That Father be ordered not to permit the Cohabitant to have any caretaking role or unsupervised contact with the Children;  

   c. In the alternative, and if the Court determines that Father will continue to reside with or have ongoing contact with the Cohabitant, that Father’s parenting time shall be supervised by a neutral third party or at a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, until further order of the Court;  

   d. That Father be ordered to promptly inform Mother of any new change in his residence or household composition and of any further criminal charges, restraining orders, or police-involved incidents involving the Cohabitant or occurring in the home where the Children are present;  

   e. That all prior orders of the Court not inconsistent with the modified parenting-time provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

47. Mother further requests that the Court schedule a prompt hearing on this Complaint for Modification, and that, if necessary to protect the Children pending final adjudication, the Court enter appropriate temporary orders under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 215, § 6 consistent with the relief requested above.

48. Mother believes and avers that the requested modifications are necessary to protect the Children’s physical safety and emotional health, are in the Children’s best interests, and are consistent with Massachusetts statutory law and controlling case law governing modification of custody and parenting-time orders.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2020 custody and parenting-time judgment;

2. Find that the requested modifications are in the best interests of the minor children, Emily (age 8) and Noah (age 6);

3. Modify the existing custody and parenting-time order as follows:

   a. Order that Father’s parenting time occur only when the Cohabitant is not present in the home or otherwise in the Children’s presence;  

   b. Prohibit the Cohabitant from having any caretaking role or unsupervised contact with the Children;  

   c. In the alternative, if Father continues to cohabit with or maintain substantial contact between the Cohabitant and the Children, order that Father’s parenting time be supervised by a neutral third party or a supervised visitation center approved by the Court, until further order;  

   d. Order Father to provide Mother with prompt written notice of any change in address, household composition, or any new criminal charges, restraining orders, or police-involved incidents involving the Cohabitant or occurring at his residence when the Children are present;

4. Enter such temporary orders as may be necessary to protect the Children pending final resolution of this Complaint;

5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
RACHEL THOMPSON,  
By herself, pro se
