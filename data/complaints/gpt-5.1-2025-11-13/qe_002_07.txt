COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Maya Johnson (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Lisa Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Maya Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Lisa Thompson is an individual and the owner and landlord of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119, and at all relevant times has rented the Premises to Plaintiff.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action arises under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment).

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3–5 because:

   a. The Premises are located in Roxbury, Suffolk County, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court; and  

   b. This action concerns the rental, condition, and occupancy of residential housing, including alleged breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

6. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Basement Apartment, Roxbury, Massachusetts.

7. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Premises as her home from March 1, 2022 through the present.

8. The agreed monthly rent for the Premises is $1,200, payable to Defendant.

9. Plaintiff has generally paid rent when due. In October 2025, Plaintiff was approximately two weeks late in paying the rent due to medical bills, but she subsequently paid all outstanding rent and the late fee demanded by Defendant.

10. Plaintiff has at all times material complied substantially with her obligations as a tenant, including maintaining the Premises in a reasonable condition and not causing damage to the structure or systems.

11. In or about November 2025, Plaintiff began to notice water seeping through a basement wall of the Premises whenever it rained heavily.

12. The water intrusion came through the foundation/basement wall and spread into the interior floor area adjacent to that wall.

13. The water intrusion was substantial and recurring, not a minor or isolated incident, and created dampness and moisture conditions within the Premises.

14. On or about November 2025 (shortly after the problem began), Plaintiff notified Defendant by text message that water was seeping through the basement wall during heavy rain and that there appeared to be a leak or structural issue.

15. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but did not promptly or adequately repair the condition.

16. Over the following weeks, no effective repairs were made by Defendant, and the water intrusion continued when it rained.

17. During this period, the recurring water seepage damaged Plaintiff’s personal property, including but not limited to:

   a. A rug placed on the floor near the affected wall; and  
   b. A bookshelf positioned against or near the affected wall, which was warped and damaged by moisture.

18. Plaintiff estimates the value of the damaged personal property at approximately four hundred dollars ($400).

19. The recurring water seepage and dampness also forced Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier on a frequent and near-continuous basis in an effort to reduce moisture and prevent further damage, at additional out‑of‑pocket cost for electricity.

20. The water seepage and damp conditions materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises as a safe and habitable residence.

21. After Defendant failed to repair the condition within a reasonable time following notice, Plaintiff, concerned about her health and safety and the continued damage, contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department (or other appropriate municipal housing/code enforcement authority) in or about late November 2025.

22. Municipal inspectors came to the Premises, observed the water intrusion problem, and identified that condition as well as additional code violations or issues.

23. The water intrusion and any related dampness, moisture, and structural conditions constitute violations of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., including but not limited to provisions requiring that:

   a. Every dwelling be maintained in a safe, sanitary condition and free from chronic dampness (see 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq.); and  

   b. The owner maintain the structural elements and foundation in a condition that prevents water penetration and chronic moisture.

24. Notwithstanding the City’s inspection and findings, Defendant still failed and has continued to fail to make adequate repairs to stop the water intrusion and to remedy the related conditions.

25. The water problem remains unresolved as of the date of this Complaint, and water continues to seep into the Premises during heavy rain, interfering with Plaintiff’s normal, quiet, and safe use of her home.

26. Following Plaintiff’s contacting the City and the inspection, Defendant began characterizing Plaintiff as a “problem tenant.”

27. Defendant has stated to Plaintiff that she does not intend to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026 (the current lease year running through March 1, 2026) and that Plaintiff will be required to vacate at that time.

28. Defendant has claimed that the reason she will not renew the lease is Plaintiff’s brief late payment of rent in October 2025, even though that payment issue was resolved and Plaintiff paid all rent and late fees.

29. The timing of Defendant’s refusal to renew—shortly after Plaintiff complained about the water intrusion and contacted municipal authorities—strongly suggests that Defendant’s actions are in retaliation for Plaintiff’s lawful exercise of her rights to report sanitary code and housing code violations.

30. The threatened non‑renewal and characterization of Plaintiff as a “problem tenant,” combined with the ongoing unrepaired water intrusion, have created substantial stress, uncertainty, and interference with Plaintiff’s right to quietly enjoy and occupy the Premises.

31. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to correct the water intrusion and related conditions, and Defendant’s conduct following Plaintiff’s complaints and the inspection, Plaintiff has suffered:

   a. Property damage (approximately $400) to personal belongings;  
   b. Increased utility costs for running a dehumidifier;  
   c. Disruption and substantial interference with the use of portions of the Premises during and after rainstorms;  
   d. Anxiety and distress related to the safety and habitability of the Premises; and  
   e. Loss of the full value of the rent paid during periods when the Premises did not comply with the State Sanitary Code and were not maintained in a habitable condition.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

32. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully set forth herein.

33. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease and tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

34. G.L. c. 186, § 14 further provides that a landlord who violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

35. Massachusetts courts have held that substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises, including interference arising from serious sanitary code violations and uncorrected water leaks, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See, e.g.*,  

   - *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (landlord’s failure to rectify chronic conditions can constitute violation of quiet enjoyment);  
   - *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (substantial interference with tenant’s use and enjoyment, traceable to landlord’s actions or inaction, violates covenant);  
   - *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment protects tenant from serious interference with tenancy);  
   - *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982) (unsanitary conditions attributable to landlord can be basis for quiet enjoyment claim).

36. Serious or chronic violations of the State Sanitary Code are evidence of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *See* *Hemingway v. Commonwealth*, 363 Mass. 184, 196–200 (1973) (recognizing significance of sanitary code to habitability and tenant’s rights); *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973); *Young v. Patrons Mut. Ins. Co.*, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 372 (1998).

37. Under G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L and the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., landlords are required to maintain residential premises in compliance with minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, including freedom from chronic dampness and water penetration.

38. Defendant, as the landlord and person in control of the Premises, had a statutory and common‑law duty to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition, free from chronic water intrusion, and in compliance with the State Sanitary Code. *See* G.L. c. 186, § 14; G.L. c. 111, §§ 127A–127L; *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).

39. Plaintiff provided Defendant with actual notice of the water intrusion and damp conditions by text message in November 2025 and through the subsequent municipal inspection.

40. Notwithstanding such notice, Defendant failed within a reasonable time to abate the water intrusion or otherwise restore the Premises to a condition consistent with the State Sanitary Code and Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.

41. Defendant’s failure to remedy the water intrusion and related sanitary code violations after notice constitutes a “direct or indirect interference” with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. *See* *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Lowery v. Robinson*, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

42. In addition, Defendant’s actions and statements regarding Plaintiff being a “problem tenant” and the refusal to renew the lease shortly after Plaintiff exercised her rights by contacting the City and reporting code violations further interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and security in her tenancy.

43. Although this Complaint asserts only a cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff notes that Massachusetts law protects tenants from retaliatory conduct by landlords, including refusal to renew a lease after the tenant reports code violations. *See* G.L. c. 186, § 18; *Spence v. O’Brien*, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987). These principles inform and support the finding that Defendant’s conduct interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

44. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment caused by Defendant’s acts and omissions is substantial and not merely trivial or momentary. *See* *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (substantial interference required).

45. Defendant’s conduct and omissions were at least negligent and, in light of repeated notice and the municipal inspection, were willful, knowing, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered “actual and consequential damages” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to:

   a. Damage to personal property (approximately $400);  
   b. Increased electricity charges for continuous operation of a dehumidifier;  
   c. Loss of use and enjoyment of portions of the Premises during rain events;  
   d. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Premises during periods of violation; and  
   e. Emotional distress, inconvenience, and disruption of daily life.

47. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,200, so three months’ rent equals $3,600.

48. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is presently self‑represented and does not seek attorney’s fees incurred to date, she reserves the right to seek statutory attorney’s fees if she later retains counsel.

49. Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 is further supported by the broader Massachusetts public policy favoring safe and habitable housing and protecting tenants’ rights to report code violations, as reflected in G.L. c. 184, § 18 (restrictions on waivers of rights in leases), G.L. c. 93A (regulation of unfair or deceptive acts in trade or commerce), and the decisions in *Hemingway*, *Al-Ziab*, *Blackett*, and related cases.

50. Plaintiff therefore seeks all remedies provided under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to statutory damages of not less than three months’ rent, plus her actual and consequential damages, costs, and such further relief as this Court deems just.
