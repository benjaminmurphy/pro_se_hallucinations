  Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK JOHNSON,  
  Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

Docket No.: ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20)  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor (“Mother”), and complains of the Defendant, Mark Johnson (“Father”), and says as follows:

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is an individual residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson (date of birth approximately 2015; age 10).

2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, upon information and belief, resides in or near Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Emily Johnson.

3. The child, Emily Johnson, has resided in Massachusetts for more than six months preceding the filing of this Complaint, and this Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting matters concerning the child pursuant to M.G.L. c. 209B and the prior Judgment of this Court.

### II. JURISDICTION AND PRIOR JUDGMENT

4. This matter is properly before the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, which issued a prior custody and parenting-time Judgment (the “Judgment”) on or about June 15, 2020.

5. The June 15, 2020 Judgment provides, in substance, that:
   a. The parties share joint legal custody of Emily Johnson;  
   b. The Mother is the primary residential parent; and  
   c. The Father has substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sundays and associated school-night responsibilities.

6. The Judgment also requires the parties to cooperate on school-related matters, to keep each other reasonably informed regarding the child’s education, and to act in the child’s best interests consistent with Massachusetts law, including M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law such as *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).

7. This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and, to the extent applicable, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20), which authorize the Court to modify custody and parenting-time provisions of an existing judgment upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where the proposed modification is in the child’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).

### III. MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

8. At the time of the June 15, 2020 Judgment, Emily Johnson was attending school regularly, was not subject to truancy warnings, and her grades and test scores were appropriate for her age and grade level.

9. Since approximately the past year, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances relating to the child’s schooling and Father’s exercise of parenting time, particularly on Sunday overnights and subsequent Monday school attendance.

10. On a recurring basis during the past year, Father has kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, including Sunday overnight, asserting that the child “needs a mental health day.”

11. These Monday absences have not been supported by any medical provider, psychological professional, or other clinician; there are no doctor’s notes or other professional documentation justifying the repeated absences.

12. As a direct consequence of these repeated unexcused or inadequately documented absences, the school has issued truancy warnings concerning Emily, reflecting significant concern over her attendance.

13. Over the same time period, Emily’s academic performance has declined: her grades and standardized test scores have dropped compared to her prior record, and school personnel have communicated concerns to Mother about the impact of missed instructional time.

14. The Father has also repeatedly refused or failed to bring Emily to tutoring sessions that are scheduled during his weekend parenting time, despite being informed of the importance of these sessions for addressing academic difficulties.

15. These actions by Father—keeping Emily home from school without proper justification and failing to bring her to tutoring—are inconsistent with the Judgment’s requirement that the parties cooperate regarding the child’s education and make joint legal-custody decisions in the child’s best interests. See *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (conflict in joint legal custody and failure to cooperate may warrant modification); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (best interests includes promoting education and emotional welfare).

16. Since entry of the Judgment, the pattern of Father’s interference with or neglect of the child’s school attendance and tutoring obligations represents a substantial change from the circumstances that existed at the time of the 2020 order.

17. This change was neither contemplated nor reasonably foreseeable at the time of the 2020 Judgment and directly undermines the assumptions on which the prior joint legal-custody and parenting-time arrangement was based. See *Macaulay v. Macaulay*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 10 (1984) (modification appropriate where circumstances underlying prior judgment materially change).

18. The cumulative effect of:
    a. Repeated, unjustified Monday absences;  
    b. Truancy warnings issued by the school;  
    c. Declining grades and test scores; and  
    d. Father’s regular refusal to bring the child to tutoring during his parenting time,  
has significantly and negatively affected Emily’s education and well-being.

19. Father’s conduct demonstrates an ongoing inability or refusal to prioritize Emily’s educational needs and to comply with the spirit and letter of joint legal custody, which requires meaningful, cooperative decision-making and consistent support for the child’s schooling. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (stability and cooperation are critical in custody arrangements); *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).

20. Father’s pattern of behavior has created substantial conflict around basic educational decisions, including school attendance and participation in remedial services, rendering the current joint legal custody arrangement unworkable as to educational issues. See *Vilakazi v. Maxie*, 371 Mass. 406 (1976); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010) (courts may modify legal custody to resolve ongoing decision-making impasses affecting the child).

21. The negative impact on Emily’s academic progress, the school’s truancy concerns, and the Father’s persistent failure to support the child’s educational plan together constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances since the June 15, 2020 Judgment, within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.

### IV. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD

22. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, including *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), and *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998), as well as *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), the paramount consideration in any custody or parenting-time modification is the best interests of the child.

23. The best interests standard encompasses the child’s physical, emotional, and educational needs, stability, and the ability of each parent to meet those needs and foster the child’s development. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

24. Regular school attendance and appropriate participation in tutoring and other academic supports are essential to Emily’s educational development and overall welfare.

25. Father’s ongoing pattern of keeping Emily out of school on Mondays and failing to take her to tutoring during his parenting time is contrary to her best interests and threatens her educational progress and future opportunities.

26. The Mother has consistently prioritized Emily’s schooling, communicated with the school, arranged tutoring, and attempted to ensure compliance with school attendance requirements.

27. In light of the present circumstances, Emily’s best interests require that:
   a. One parent have final decision-making authority over educational matters, including school attendance, or  
   b. Father’s parenting time be modified so that he does not have school-night overnights that result in missed school and tutoring,  
or both.

28. A narrowly tailored modification, either granting Mother final decision-making authority regarding educational issues (including school attendance and tutoring) or reducing/removing Father’s school-night overnights (especially Sunday nights), will serve Emily’s best interests while preserving Father’s relationship with the child consistent with her educational needs.

29. The requested modification is not sought to interfere with Father’s relationship with Emily, but rather to ensure that Emily receives consistent education, complies with school attendance requirements, and can benefit from tutoring and other supports without undue interference.

30. The relief requested below is reasonable, proportional to the problems that have arisen, and necessary to protect Emily’s best interests in light of the material and substantial change in circumstances.

### V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2020 Judgment, specifically regarding Emily Johnson’s school attendance, truancy warnings, declining academic performance, and Father’s failure to support the child’s education and tutoring during his parenting time.

2. Find that modification of the existing custody and parenting-time provisions is necessary and appropriate to serve the best interests of the child, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (and, as applicable, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20), and consistent with Massachusetts case law, including but not limited to:
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006);  
   - *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981);  
   - *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996);  
   - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003);  
   - *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985);  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981);  
   - *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981);  
   - *Macaulay v. Macaulay*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 10 (1984);  
   - *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998); and  
   - *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

3. Modify the existing Judgment to provide that, while legal custody remains joint in general, the Mother shall have final decision-making authority regarding all educational matters, including but not limited to:
   a. School attendance and decisions whether the child will attend or be excused from school on any given day;  
   b. Enrollment in and attendance at tutoring or academic support programs; and  
   c. Cooperation with school recommendations and remedial services.

OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE (OR IN ADDITION):

4. Modify the existing Judgment to adjust the Father’s parenting time so that:
   a. Father shall no longer have Sunday overnight parenting time (or any other school-night overnight) when school is in session, unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the parties; and/or  
   b. Father’s parenting time shall be structured so that Emily is in Mother’s care on Sunday evenings and other school-night evenings to ensure she attends school and tutoring as scheduled.

5. Order that both parents shall comply with all school attendance requirements, promptly provide each other with information regarding school notices, truancy warnings, report cards, and standardized test results, and cooperate in good faith to support Emily’s education.

6. Order that Father shall ensure that Emily attends all scheduled tutoring and school-related remedial services that occur during his parenting time, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties or modified by court order.

7. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper to protect the best interests of the minor child, including any clarifying orders necessary to implement the modified custody and parenting schedule.
