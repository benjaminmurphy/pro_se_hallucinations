COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE  

1. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02144.

2. Defendant Michael Richards (“Defendant”) is an individual, on information and belief residing in Massachusetts, and at all relevant times was the owner and/or landlord of the residential rental premises located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts (the “Property”), including Plaintiff’s apartment at Unit 2 (the “Premises”).

3. This action arises from Defendant’s violation of the statutory and common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment appurtenant to Plaintiff’s tenancy at the Premises, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts landlord‑tenant law.

4. The amount in controversy is approximately Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600), exclusive of statutory multiples, interest, and costs.

5. This Court has subject‑matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 19A, and G.L. c. 212, § 3, because the events giving rise to this complaint occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and the damages sought are within the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, because the cause of action arose in Somerville, Middlesex County, where the leased Premises are located and where Defendant transacts business as a landlord.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendant for the rental of the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02144.

8. Under the Lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent in the amount of One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800) in exchange for the right to occupy the Premises as a residential tenant.

9. The Lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Premises.

10. Independently of the Lease language, Massachusetts law implies into every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment and prohibits landlords from interfering with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).

11. Plaintiff has continuously occupied the Premises as their primary residence since on or about May 1, 2022, and has paid rent as required under the Lease.

12. Plaintiff lives on the second floor of a three‑family “triple‑decker” building at the Property.

13. Approximately six months before the filing of this Complaint, new tenants moved into the third‑floor apartment directly above Plaintiff.

14. After the new upstairs tenants moved in, Plaintiff began to experience persistent, excessive, and unreasonable noise emanating from the upstairs unit, including:  
    a. Loud stomping and heavy footfalls at all hours of the day and night;  
    b. Music played at high volumes late into the night; and  
    c. Frequent sounds of furniture or other heavy objects being moved or dragged across the floor, often around midnight or later.

15. The noise from the upstairs unit has been ongoing, chronic, and frequently occurs during late‑night and early‑morning hours when tenants would reasonably expect to be able to sleep.

16. The noise is of such a nature, frequency, and volume that it substantially and unreasonably interferes with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and use and enjoy the Premises as a residence.

17. Plaintiff has averaged only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night since the upstairs tenants moved in.

18. Plaintiff made reasonable efforts to address the issue directly with the upstairs tenants by personally asking them to reduce the noise and be more considerate about late‑night activities.

19. Following Plaintiff’s initial request, the upstairs tenants reduced their noise temporarily for approximately one week, but then resumed the same loud and disruptive conduct.

20. After the noise problem persisted, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the issue and requested Defendant’s assistance in addressing the ongoing disturbance from the upstairs tenants.

21. Plaintiff complained to Defendant regarding the noise on at least five to six separate occasions over a period of months, by phone, email, and/or other communication.

22. On at least one occasion, Defendant informed Plaintiff that he spoke with the upstairs tenants about the noise.

23. However, Defendant took no effective or sustained action to abate the problem, and the noisy conduct of the upstairs tenants continued as before.

24. Defendant further stated to Plaintiff, in substance, that he “can’t control how people live,” indicating his unwillingness to take further or meaningful steps to address the disturbances.

25. Despite repeated notice from Plaintiff, Defendant failed to take reasonable measures that a landlord exercising ordinary care and control over the premises and his tenants would take to prevent one tenancy from substantially interfering with another.

26. The ongoing excessive noise from the upstairs tenants, combined with Defendant’s failure and refusal to take appropriate action, has caused Plaintiff substantial loss of sleep and significant disruption of Plaintiff’s daily life.

27. As a direct result of the chronic sleep deprivation caused by the persistent noise, Plaintiff has suffered adverse consequences at work, including receiving a written warning for falling asleep at their desk.

28. Plaintiff’s loss of sleep and stress from the noise and related work issues prompted Plaintiff to seek medical attention.

29. Plaintiff’s physician prescribed sleep medication to help Plaintiff cope with the chronic sleep disruption.

30. Plaintiff pays approximately Forty Dollars ($40) per month out‑of‑pocket for the prescribed sleep medication.

31. In addition to medication, Plaintiff purchased earplugs and a white‑noise machine and attempted to rearrange their bedroom to mitigate the noise, but these measures did not solve the problem.

32. Despite these efforts, the noise from the upstairs unit continues to interfere with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and otherwise use the Premises for its intended residential purpose.

33. The interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises has been substantial, serious, and ongoing, not merely trivial or transitory.

34. Plaintiff has experienced significant emotional distress, anxiety, fatigue, frustration, and disruption of daily activities, including job performance, as a direct result of the ongoing noise and sleep deprivation.

35. Defendant, as landlord and owner, has the right and ability to control and regulate the conduct of the upstairs tenants in order to prevent disturbances that interfere with other tenants’ quiet enjoyment of their premises. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

36. Defendant had actual notice of the ongoing disturbance, given Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and requests for intervention.

37. Despite such notice, Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to take effective steps within his power—such as issuing formal warnings, enforcing lease provisions, imposing conditions, or, if necessary, pursuing eviction or other legal remedies—to prevent the continuation of the disturbance.

38. Defendant’s inaction and dismissive response, in the face of continuous and foreseeable interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy caused by another tenant under Defendant’s control, constitutes an unreasonable and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

39. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent as required, notwithstanding the substantial impairment of the value and habitability of the Premises caused by the ongoing disturbance and Defendant’s failure to address it.

40. Plaintiff estimates that, based on the severity and duration of the interference with quiet enjoyment, they have sustained actual damages of at least Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600), including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, sleep‑related health impacts, workplace consequences, and out‑of‑pocket costs such as medication and mitigation measures.

41. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover their actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is self‑represented and does not presently claim attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff reserves any rights as may be available under law.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

42. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 41 as if fully set forth herein.

43. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

44. The statute codifies and supplements the common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every lease. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

45. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from serious interferences with their tenancy that are the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s actions or inactions. See Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716–18 (1977).

46. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may be liable for a breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord, having control over the premises and notice of a disturbing condition created by other tenants or third parties, fails to take reasonable steps within their control to abate that condition, and such failure results in a substantial interference with another tenant’s use and enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 716–18; Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994).

47. A violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 does not require proof of malice or intent; it suffices that the interference is a natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s conduct or failure to act. See Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 851–52; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03.

48. Massachusetts courts have held that substantial and chronic disturbances—such as excessive noise, threats, or other conditions interfering with sleep and peace in the home—can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–18 (noise from lounge operated by landlord breached quiet enjoyment); Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85 (landlord’s failure to address known harassment and threats violated quiet enjoyment); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982, 982–83 (1982) (substantial interference with tenant’s peaceful enjoyment actionable).

49. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a statutory and common‑law duty not to interfere, directly or indirectly, with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03.

50. The chronic, excessive, and late‑night noise from the upstairs tenants—including stomping, loud music, and moving furniture—constituted a substantial and unreasonable interference with the residential character of Plaintiff’s tenancy and Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and live peacefully in the Premises.

51. Defendant had actual notice of this interference through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, made over the course of several months.

52. Defendant had the legal right, practical ability, and responsibility to control and regulate the conduct of the upstairs tenants by enforcing lease terms, house rules, and applicable law, and by taking steps such as issuing written notices, imposing conditions, or, if necessary, seeking to terminate or not renew the upstairs tenants’ tenancy.

53. Defendant’s statement that he “can’t control how people live,” combined with his failure to take meaningful or effective action beyond a single conversation with the upstairs tenants, demonstrates his unwillingness to use the authority he possessed to abate the problem.

54. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps within his control, despite knowledge of the ongoing interference, allowed the disturbance to continue and escalate, and therefore constitutes an indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 717–18; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

55. Defendant’s conduct and omissions were the natural and probable cause of the continued interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy, as a landlord who fails to act on known disturbances can reasonably foresee that such disturbances will persist and impair a neighboring tenant’s use and enjoyment.

56. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was not de minimis or occasional, but significant, repetitive, and continuing, depriving Plaintiff of basic sleep and rest and substantially reducing the value and habitability of the Premises to Plaintiff. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 776–78 (1994).

57. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Loss of sleep and chronic fatigue;  
    b. Emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish;  
    c. Diminished ability to perform at work, including a written warning for falling asleep at work;  
    d. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for sleep medication (approximately $40 per month);  
    e. Out‑of‑pocket costs for attempted mitigation measures (earplugs, white‑noise machine, and related items); and  
    f. Loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises and substantial impairment of their value as a residence.

58. Plaintiff reasonably estimates their actual damages at not less than Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600), and reserves the right to amend this amount as discovery and evidence may warrant.

59. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover, at a minimum, the greater of: (a) actual and consequential damages; or (b) three months’ rent. Based on a monthly rent of $1,800, three months’ rent equals $5,400.

60. Accordingly, under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and relevant case law (including Blackett; Simon; Al‑Ziab; Doe; and Cruz Mgmt.), Plaintiff is entitled to recover three months’ rent ($5,400), or such other amount as the Court deems just, together with costs and such additional relief as may be appropriate.

61. To the extent applicable, Massachusetts law recognizes the availability of damages for emotional distress and mental suffering arising from a landlord’s breach of quiet enjoyment. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–04; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

62. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is ongoing, and Plaintiff may continue to incur damages until such time as the interference is effectively abated or the tenancy is otherwise resolved.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in their favor and against Defendant Michael Richards and grant the following relief:

A. A declaration that Defendant has breached the statutory and common‑law covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law;

B. An award of monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than Plaintiff’s actual damages reasonably estimated at $3,600, and including damages for loss of use and enjoyment, emotional distress, sleep‑related health impacts, workplace consequences, and out‑of‑pocket expenses;

C. Statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 in the amount of at least three months’ rent ($5,400), or such greater amount as the evidence may show and the Court deems just;

D. An award of costs of this action, including allowable court fees and other recoverable costs;

E. Pre‑judgment and post‑judgment interest at the statutory rate; and

F. Such further and other relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and proper.

JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
