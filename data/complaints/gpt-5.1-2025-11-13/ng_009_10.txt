LYNN APARTMENTS LLC,  
    Defendant.


PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE


Plaintiff Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing on the third floor of a residential apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns, operates, manages, controls, and/or maintains the residential apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905 (the “Premises”).

3. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant, directly and/or through its agents, servants, employees, and/or contractors, was responsible for the ownership, operation, maintenance, and safety of the Premises, including the common hallway areas and the smoke detection system therein.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injury sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in Lynn District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2–3, because the events and omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts, and the Premises are located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

8. At all relevant times, Plaintiff rented and occupied a residential apartment unit on the third floor of the Premises located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts.

9. The Premises contain common areas, including hallways and stairwells, which are under the exclusive control, management, and maintenance of Defendant, as landlord and property owner.

10. The common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment unit was equipped with a smoke detector that was intended and required to provide early warning of fire and smoke conditions within the building.

11. For months prior to August 15, 2023, the smoke detector located in the third-floor common hallway directly outside Plaintiff’s apartment emitted a repetitive “chirping” sound indicating a low or failing battery.

12. Despite this persistent low-battery alarm, the smoke detector was not repaired, serviced, or otherwise made fully operational by Defendant or its agents.

13. Eventually, and prior to August 15, 2023, an unknown person removed the battery from the hallway smoke detector, apparently to stop the chirping noise, and left the battery sitting on the windowsill next to the detector.

14. After the battery was removed, the smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit was nonfunctional and incapable of providing any audible warning of fire or smoke.

15. Plaintiff personally observed that the battery had been removed and that it had been left on the windowsill.

16. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the malfunctioning detector and missing battery on at least three separate occasions in the months leading up to August 15, 2023.

17. On each such occasion, Plaintiff either spoke directly with Defendant’s representative, agent, or property manager, or otherwise communicated to Defendant that: (a) the hallway smoke detector outside her unit had been chirping due to a low battery, (b) the battery had been removed, and (c) the detector was not functioning.

18. In response to Plaintiff’s multiple complaints and notices, Defendant, through its representatives, repeatedly assured Plaintiff that it would “take care of it” and repair or replace the battery and/or smoke detector.

19. Despite these assurances and despite having actual notice of the inoperable smoke detector, Defendant failed to timely inspect, repair, replace, or otherwise restore the hallway smoke detector to working condition.

20. Defendant’s failure to remedy the nonfunctional hallway smoke detector persisted for an extended period of time prior to August 15, 2023.

21. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately nighttime hours, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment unit at the Premises, apparently originating in the kitchen of that unit.

22. The fire generated substantial smoke that traveled upward through the building, including into the stairwells and common hallways serving the upper floors where Plaintiff resided.

23. Because the smoke detector in the third-floor hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment was missing its battery and was nonfunctional, no warning or alarm sounded on Plaintiff’s floor as the smoke from the fire spread through the building.

24. Had the hallway smoke detector been in proper working order with an installed battery, it would have emitted an audible alarm providing earlier warning of the fire and smoke conditions to Plaintiff and other occupants on the third floor.

25. Plaintiff remained unaware of the fire for a period of time during which smoke was already accumulating in the hallways and common areas near her apartment.

26. Plaintiff eventually detected the smell of smoke emanating from outside her unit and, upon exiting her apartment, encountered a hallway already thick with smoke.

27. Plaintiff’s ability to breathe was immediately compromised by the smoke-filled conditions in the hallway as she attempted to evacuate the building.

28. As Plaintiff navigated the smoke-filled hallway and stairwells to escape, she inhaled significant amounts of smoke and experienced burning in her throat and lungs, shortness of breath, coughing, and dizziness.

29. Emergency responders, including firefighters and emergency medical services, responded to the scene of the fire.

30. As a result of the smoke inhalation sustained during the evacuation, Plaintiff was transported to a hospital for emergency evaluation and treatment.

31. Plaintiff was hospitalized overnight for smoke inhalation, respiratory distress, and related symptoms.

32. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses of approximately $5,800 in connection with her evaluation, hospitalization, and follow-up care arising from the smoke inhalation.

33. As a direct consequence of her injuries and hospitalization, Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time and lost approximately $1,200 in wages.

34. In addition to her bodily injuries, Plaintiff suffered property damage to her personal belongings, including but not limited to furniture, clothing, electronics, and household items, which were damaged or destroyed by smoke and water resulting from the fire and firefighting efforts.

35. Plaintiff also suffered pain and suffering, emotional distress, anxiety, and fear associated with the fire, the hazardous conditions in the building, and the experience of attempting to escape through a smoke‑filled environment without adequate warning.

36. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a lawful tenant and occupant of the Premises, to exercise reasonable care in the inspection, maintenance, and repair of the common areas, including the smoke detection devices installed in those areas.

37. Defendant further owed a duty to Plaintiff to comply with the applicable building codes, fire safety regulations, and statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the installation, maintenance, and operation of smoke detectors in multi-unit residential buildings.

38. Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 143, § 3, G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E, 26F, 26F½, and the State Building Code and State Fire Code (780 CMR; 527 CMR), requires owners of certain residential properties, such as multi-unit apartment buildings, to install and maintain operable smoke detectors in common hallways and areas to protect residents from fire-related harm.

39. Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Premises, had actual and constructive notice of these legal requirements concerning smoke detection systems and life-safety devices.

40. Defendant also had actual notice of the specific defect at issue—the missing and/or depleted battery and nonfunctioning state of the hallway smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s apartment—through Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and through the obvious, ongoing condition of the chirping and then nonfunctional detector.

41. Despite its legal and common-law duties, and despite actual notice of the condition, Defendant failed to act reasonably to inspect the smoke detector, ensure that a working battery was installed, and confirm that the device was operable.

42. Defendant’s failure to provide and maintain an operable smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and other tenants in the event of fire or smoke conditions in the building.

43. The absence of an operable smoke detector on Plaintiff’s floor was a substantial factor in delaying Plaintiff’s awareness of the fire, thereby causing her to be exposed to greater quantities of smoke and resulting in more severe smoke inhalation injuries than she would have suffered had an adequate early warning alarm sounded.

44. Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and emotional distress were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain the hallway smoke detector in proper working condition.

45. Plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the malfunction of the smoke detector, nor did she remove the battery or otherwise interfere with its operation.

46. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant, as landlord and owner in control of the common areas, to inspect, repair, and maintain the building’s smoke detection system, including the hallway detector outside her unit.

47. Defendant’s conduct, in failing to correct a known and obvious life-safety hazard over an extended period and in disregarding repeated tenant complaints, fell below the standard of care that a reasonably prudent landlord and property owner in similar circumstances would exercise.

---

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Negligence)**

48. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

49. Under Massachusetts law, landlords and property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to tenants and lawful occupants with respect to the condition of common areas and building systems under their control. *See, e.g.*, **Scott v. Simons**, 345 Mass. 484 (1963) (landlord liable for failure to exercise reasonable care in common areas); **Humphrey v. Byron**, 447 Mass. 322 (2006) (discussing landlord’s duty of reasonable care).

50. Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Premises and as landlord to Plaintiff, owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the common areas, including hallways and life‑safety systems, in a reasonably safe condition. *See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (imposing general duty of reasonable care to lawful entrants); **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148 (2013).

51. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain, inspect, repair, and replace smoke detectors located in the common areas of the building, consistent with both common-law standards and applicable Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and codes governing fire safety and smoke detection systems. *See, e.g.*, G.L. c. 143, § 3; G.L. c. 148, §§ 26E, 26F, 26F½; 780 CMR; 527 CMR.

52. Violation of statutes and regulations designed to protect the safety of building occupants, including fire and building codes pertaining to smoke detectors, constitutes evidence of negligence. *See* **Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.**, 408 Mass. 355, 359–60 (1990) (violation of safety regulation is evidence of negligence); **LaClair v. Silberline Mfg. Co.**, 379 Mass. 21 (1979).

53. Defendant had actual notice of the defective and nonfunctioning smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment for a substantial period prior to August 15, 2023, by virtue of Plaintiff’s multiple complaints and the obvious, audible low-battery warning condition.

54. Even if Defendant is deemed not to have had actual notice, Defendant had constructive notice of the defective condition because the low-battery chirping persisted for an extended period and because a reasonable inspection of the common hallway area would have revealed that the detector was inoperative and missing its battery. *See* **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007) (notice may be inferred where defect existed for sufficient period and reasonable inspection would have revealed it); **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.**, 363 Mass. 165 (1973).

55. Defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by, among other things:

   a. Failing to maintain an operable smoke detector in the third‑floor common hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment;

   b. Failing to replace or reinstall the smoke detector battery after being notified that it had been removed or had failed;

   c. Failing to timely inspect the smoke detectors and common areas to ensure that all required life-safety devices were functional;

   d. Failing to comply with applicable Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and building and fire codes governing the installation and maintenance of smoke detectors in multi‑unit residential buildings;

   e. Failing to adopt and implement reasonable policies and procedures to promptly address and correct reported life-safety hazards;

   f. Failing to warn Plaintiff and other tenants of the absence of a functioning smoke detector or the increased risk of harm in the event of a fire.

56. Defendant’s breaches of duty were unreasonable in light of the foreseeable risk of fire in a residential apartment building and the critical life‑safety function that smoke detectors serve in providing early warning and allowing safe evacuation.

57. The type of harm that Plaintiff suffered—smoke inhalation injuries and related damages resulting from delayed awareness of a fire—was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s failure to maintain operable smoke detectors in the common hallway areas.

58. Defendant’s acts and omissions were a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. Had the hallway smoke detector been operable with a functioning battery, Plaintiff likely would have received earlier warning of the fire, would have been able to evacuate sooner, and would have suffered less exposure to smoke and less severe injuries.

59. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord may be held liable where its negligence in maintaining building safety features contributes to a tenant’s injuries. *See* **Lindsey v. Massios**, 372 Mass. 79 (1977) (landlord responsibility for unsafe conditions in common areas); **Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson**, 379 Mass. 196 (1979) (discussing landlord’s duty and liability for negligent maintenance).

60. Plaintiff, at all relevant times, exercised reasonable care for her own safety and did not act negligently or unreasonably in a manner that would bar her recovery.

61. To the extent any comparative negligence is alleged, Plaintiff’s negligence, if any, was not greater than the negligence of Defendant, and any recovery should be diminished only in proportion to her alleged fault under G.L. c. 231, § 85. *See* **Colter v. Barber‑Greene Co.**, 403 Mass. 50 (1988) (comparative negligence).

62. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages, among others:

   a. Bodily injury in the form of smoke inhalation, respiratory difficulties, and related physical harm;

   b. Medical expenses in an approximate amount of $5,800, and such additional medical expenses as may be incurred in the future;

   c. Lost wages in an approximate amount of $1,200, and any further loss of earning capacity as may be established at trial;

   d. Property damage to personal belongings in an amount to be determined at trial;

   e. Pain and suffering, including physical pain, discomfort, and loss of enjoyment of life;

   f. Emotional distress, anxiety, and mental anguish associated with the fire, the dangerous conditions in the building, and the aftermath of the incident.

63. Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for all damages proximately caused by its negligence under Massachusetts law. *See* **Payton v. Abbott Labs**, 386 Mass. 540 (1982) (damages in negligence); **Clohessy v. Bachelor**, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 636 (1999).
