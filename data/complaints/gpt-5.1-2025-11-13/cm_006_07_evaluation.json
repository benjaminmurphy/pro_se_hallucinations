      "support_reasoning": "Hunter v. Rose does not address or approve specific, narrowly tailored visitation restrictions like prohibiting a cohabiting partner\u2019s presence or requiring supervision while a partner remains in the home. The decision applies a general best-interests analysis to a custody allocation and parenting schedule (including substantial visitation and webcams) and focuses on parental alienation, stability, and relocation, not on crafting targeted restrictions involving a third party\u2019s presence. Thus it does not provide authority for the particular modification remedies described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe judge\u2019s custody order gave Rose frequent contact with Jill, including parenting time one weekend per month in Massachusetts, five weeks in the summer, school vacations, holidays, Web camera sessions three evenings per week, and telephone calls once per week.\u2026 Moreover, the judge stated that, should Rose decide to move back to Massachusetts, the parties must work in good faith to adjust their parenting plan to meet Jill\u2019s best interests.\u201d"
