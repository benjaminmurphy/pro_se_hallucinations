COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
______________________________  


PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff Jessica Miller (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment [Unit Number Unknown], Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.

2. Defendant Thomas Landis (“Defendant”) is an individual and the owner and landlord of the residential rental premises located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Premises”), including Plaintiff’s apartment unit and the adjoining unit currently under renovation.

3. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Apartment”), for a monthly rent of $2,400.

4. Plaintiff has at all relevant times been a “tenant” within the meaning of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 239, and Defendant has at all relevant times been a “landlord” or “lessor” within the meaning of those statutes.

5. The amount in controversy exceeds $7,000, exclusive of interest and costs, when including statutory remedies, potential treble damages, and attorney’s fees as provided under Massachusetts law, and is otherwise within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in Cambridge District Court because the Premises are located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in this Court’s territorial jurisdiction. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2; G.L. c. 218, § 19.


FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 6 as if fully set forth herein.

8. Plaintiff has continuously resided in the Apartment as a tenant of Defendant since on or about May 1, 2022, and has paid rent of $2,400 per month as required by the tenancy.

9. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has complied with her obligations as a tenant under the lease and under Massachusetts law, including timely payment of rent and maintaining the Apartment in a reasonable manner.

10. The tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, guaranteeing Plaintiff’s right to the quiet, peaceful, and reasonable use and enjoyment of the Apartment without substantial interference by Defendant or those acting under his authority.

11. On or about early October 2025 (approximately two months prior to December 1, 2025), Defendant commenced substantial construction and renovation work in the unit immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s Apartment at 123 Elm Street.

12. Defendant informed Plaintiff prior to the commencement of the renovation that such work would be occurring.

13. Since the start of the renovation, on most weekdays, construction work has occurred from approximately 8:00 a.m. to approximately 5:00 p.m., including but not limited to persistent drilling, hammering, banging, and loud conversations by construction workers in close proximity to Plaintiff’s Apartment.

14. Plaintiff works from home and conducts work‑related telephone and video calls from the Apartment during normal business hours.

15. The continuous and prolonged construction noise has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to work productively, hold professional calls, and otherwise use and enjoy the Apartment during the day.

16. The construction has also generated dust and debris that have traveled into Plaintiff’s Apartment, including through vents, causing uncomfortable and unsanitary conditions and further interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

17. The interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her Apartment has been substantial, ongoing, and unreasonable in nature, scope, and duration.

18. As of December 1, 2025, the disruptive renovation work has been occurring for approximately two months and, upon information and belief based on Defendant’s statements, may continue for an additional one to two months.

19. Thus, the total period of substantial interference is expected to be at least approximately three to four consecutive months.

20. The level of noise and disruption, in combination with the dust intrusion, has rendered the Apartment significantly less habitable and significantly diminished its value and utility to Plaintiff.

21. Plaintiff has experienced stress, inconvenience, loss of concentration, and disruption to her work as a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s renovation activities and the way they have been carried out and allowed to persist immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s Apartment.

22. At all relevant times, Defendant exercised control over the construction activities, the schedule, the scope of work, and the contractors or workers performing the renovation, and he had the ability to take reasonable steps to mitigate the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment (including but not limited to scheduling, sound mitigation measures, temporary relocation, or a more meaningful rent abatement).

23. Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with any alternative housing accommodations during the renovation period, despite the foreseeable and ongoing substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.

24. Defendant offered Plaintiff only a one‑time reduction of $100 off one month’s rent, which is de minimis and does not reasonably compensate Plaintiff for the degree, intensity, and duration of the ongoing interference with quiet enjoyment.

25. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages as a result of Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to diminution in the fair rental value of the Apartment, loss of use and enjoyment, disruption and interference with her ability to work from home, annoyance, discomfort, and inconvenience.

26. Based on the nature and duration of the interference, Plaintiff reasonably estimates that she has suffered at least $2,000 in actual damages arising from Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment.

27. Plaintiff invokes her rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts law to seek appropriate damages, costs, and other relief for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.


COUNT I – BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

28. Plaintiff re‑alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 27 as if fully set forth herein.

29. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment protecting a tenant’s right to freedom from serious and substantial interference by the landlord or by those acting with the landlord’s permission or under the landlord’s control. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Wesson v. Leone Enters., Inc., 437 Mass. 708 (2002); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977).

30. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any landlord “directly or indirectly interfering with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.”

31. The covenant of quiet enjoyment may be violated by affirmative acts of the landlord or by the landlord’s failure to control conditions or activities that the landlord has the right or ability to control, where such acts or failures result in a serious interference with the tenant’s ability to use the premises. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

32. The interference need not be intentional or malicious; a landlord’s conduct that substantially impairs the character and value of the leased premises for the tenant’s ordinary uses can constitute a breach, even if arising out of renovations or improvements. See Wesson, 437 Mass. at 720–21; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

33. In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord’s leasing and permitting of a lounge that created chronic noise for tenants could constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment because the landlord created or permitted the conditions leading foreseeably to the interference.

34. Similarly here, Defendant, through his own actions and decisions, initiated, scheduled, and controlled substantial renovation work in the adjacent unit, in close proximity to Plaintiff’s Apartment, in a manner and over a duration that foreseeably caused substantial, chronic noise and dust intrusions into Plaintiff’s Apartment.

35. Defendant’s renovation activities, as carried out and permitted over approximately two months (and expected to continue for at least one to two more months), have caused a level of construction noise, disruption, and dust that materially interferes with Plaintiff’s ability to make reasonable use of the Apartment, particularly given that Plaintiff works from home during the same hours the disruptive work occurs.

36. The prolonged and significant day‑time noise, drilling, hammering, banging, and loud talking by workers, combined with dust entering the Apartment, constitute a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. See Wesson, 437 Mass. at 720–21; Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997) (landlord liability where conditions substantially impair tenant’s use); Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03.

37. Defendant had the ability and obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate this interference, including but not limited to sequencing or scheduling the work to minimize impact, installing sound or dust barriers, offering meaningful rent abatements, or offering temporary relocation or alternative accommodations. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19 (landlord responsible where it was within his power to prevent or correct the interference).

38. Defendant’s minimal offer of a one‑time $100 reduction in rent for one month is grossly inadequate in relation to the duration (months) and severity of the interference, and does not cure or negate Defendant’s breach of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment.

39. Massachusetts courts recognize that substantial interference with a tenant’s use of premises can entitle the tenant to relief, including rent abatement and statutory damages where the landlord’s acts or omissions fall within G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Wesson, 437 Mass. at 721–23; Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390, 402 (1982) (discussing remedies for landlord interference and statutory protections); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789–90 (1994).

40. By knowingly allowing and directing prolonged, highly disruptive renovation work in the unit immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s Apartment, with resulting chronic noise and dust intrusions that substantially impaired Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home, Defendant has directly and indirectly interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

41. Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was not trivial, isolated, or momentary; rather, it has persisted for approximately two months and is expected to continue, affecting Plaintiff’s use of her home on an almost daily basis during normal waking and working hours.

42. The interference has been particularly severe in light of Plaintiff’s well‑known need to work from home during business hours, a fact or circumstance that is reasonably foreseeable to a landlord in the current era and was, upon information and belief, known or should have been known to Defendant.

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Diminution in the fair rental value of the Apartment during the construction period due to noise, dust, and disruption;

   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of her home, including inability to peacefully work from home or conduct calls without significant disturbance;

   c. Annoyance, discomfort, and inconvenience caused by the chronic noise and dust intrusions; and  

   d. Other economic and non‑economic losses reasonably related to the interference.

44. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus the costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees (even if she later retains counsel), as well as any other relief the Court deems just and proper. See Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 789–90.

45. Plaintiff currently estimates her actual damages at not less than $2,000 based on the significant interference experienced to date, and reserves the right to amend this Complaint to conform to the evidence and to seek the full statutory remedies available, including an award based on three months’ rent ($7,200) if that amount is greater than provable actual and consequential damages at trial.

46. Defendant’s conduct, in light of his control over the renovations and foreseeability of the disturbance, is of the type that Massachusetts courts have held sufficient to establish a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Wesson, 437 Mass. at 720–21; Al‑Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284; Cruz Mgmt. Co., 417 Mass. at 789–90; Wolfberg, 385 Mass. at 402; Simon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; see also G.L. c. 186, §§ 14, 18; G.L. c. 239, § 8A.

47. Accordingly, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.


PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Thomas Landis, and grant the following relief:
