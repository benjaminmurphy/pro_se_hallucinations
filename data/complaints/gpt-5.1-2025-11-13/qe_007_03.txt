JESSICA WALLIS,  
     Plaintiff,  

v.                                                     Civil Action No. __________  

MARK THOMPSON,  
     Defendant.

COMPLAINT  
(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
______________________________  

PARTIES  

1.     Plaintiff, Jessica Wallis (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Wallis”), is an individual residing at 218 Harvard Street, Apartment ___, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.

2.     Defendant, Mark Thompson (“Defendant” or “Mr. Thompson”), is an individual and the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (“the Premises”), including the apartment rented by Plaintiff and the adjacent unit presently under renovation.

3.     At all relevant times, Defendant acted individually and through his agents, contractors, and/or employees, who were engaged in renovation and construction work on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment at the Premises.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

4.     This action is brought pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential tenancies).

5.     The Cambridge Division of the District Court Department has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19, 21, and related provisions, because this is a civil action for money damages arising out of a landlord‑tenant relationship and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

6.     Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court because the rental premises that are the subject of this dispute are located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. See G.L. c. 223, §§ 1, 2.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7.     On or about May 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for an apartment at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (the “Apartment” or “Rental Unit”).

8.     Plaintiff has, since on or about May 1, 2021, continuously occupied the Apartment as her principal residence.

9.     Plaintiff and Defendant are parties to a rental agreement (written or oral) by which Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $2,300.00 to Defendant in exchange for the right to occupy the Apartment and related services and facilities.

10.   Plaintiff has, at all relevant times, paid or duly tendered the monthly rent of $2,300.00 when due, or otherwise substantially complied with her obligations as a residential tenant.

11.   Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, whether or not expressly written in the lease. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Linhart v. Boston Hous. Auth., 1 Mass. App. Ct. 830 (1973); Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp., 340 Mass. 124 (1959).

12.   In or about early October 2025, Defendant caused or permitted extensive renovation work to commence on the residential unit directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s Apartment at 218 Harvard Street.

13.   Prior to the start of construction, Defendant informed Plaintiff that renovation work on the neighboring unit would occur; however, Defendant did not provide any clear end date or reasonably accurate estimate of the duration or full extent of the disruption.

14.   Beginning approximately two months ago, and continuing on a regular basis through at least December 1, 2025, construction activities in the adjacent unit have generated persistent, intrusive, and highly disruptive noise, including drilling, hammering, banging, and loud conversation by workers.

15.   On weekdays, the construction noise typically begins at or around 8:00 a.m. and continues until approximately 5:00 p.m., substantially filling the normal business day with loud, repetitive construction sounds.

16.   Plaintiff works from home and is required to participate in phone and video calls and to perform concentrated computer‑based work during normal business hours.

17.   The construction noise described above has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to hear, speak, and concentrate during work‑related calls and meetings, and has significantly disrupted her work productivity and daily quiet use of her home.

18.   In addition to noise, the renovation work has caused dust and debris to travel into Plaintiff’s Apartment, including through the building’s ventilation system, resulting in visible dust accumulation and diminished air quality inside the Apartment.

19.   Plaintiff has experienced discomfort and inconvenience from the presence of construction dust in her living space and has been required to spend additional time and effort cleaning the Apartment as a result.

20.   The level, frequency, and duration of the construction noise and dust have substantially exceeded what is reasonably necessary or incidental to ordinary building maintenance or short‑term repair work, particularly in light of the multi‑month duration and the expectation of an additional month or more of similar disruption.

21.   Plaintiff complained to Defendant about the ongoing disturbance, explaining that the noise and dust were significantly affecting her ability to work from home and to enjoy the Apartment as her residence.

22.   Defendant offered Plaintiff a one‑time rent reduction of approximately $100 off a single month’s rent as compensation for the ongoing disruption.

23.   The offered $100 reduction was minimal in relation to the severity, intensity, and duration of the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

24.   Defendant continued to permit the renovation work to proceed in the same manner and intensity, without implementing reasonable additional measures to mitigate or minimize the noise and dust affecting Plaintiff’s Apartment, such as scheduling the loudest work for limited hours, installing adequate temporary sound or dust barriers, or offering Plaintiff a meaningful rent abatement or temporary alternate housing.

25.   As a result of Defendant’s acts and omissions, Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment have been materially and substantially impaired for at least approximately two consecutive months, with the prospect of continued impairment for one to two additional months.

26.   During this period, Plaintiff has been deprived of the essential residential benefit of a reasonably quiet and habitable home for a substantial portion of each weekday, including the primary hours during which she must work from home.

27.   Plaintiff has suffered stress, inconvenience, loss of sleep, disruption to her work, and loss of the beneficial use of her Apartment during the noisy and dusty hours, as well as annoyance, discomfort, and emotional distress.

28.   Plaintiff estimates her damages resulting from the substantial interference with her quiet enjoyment of the Apartment to be at least $500.00, exclusive of interest, costs, and any statutory enhancements or attorney’s fees.

29.   Defendant, as the landlord and person in control of the Premises, had the ability and authority to control, schedule, manage, or mitigate the renovation work and its impacts on Plaintiff’s Apartment, but failed to do so reasonably.

30.   Defendant’s conduct, and that of his agents and contractors, in allowing persistent and excessive noise and dust to emanate from the adjacent unit for a prolonged period, without adequate mitigation or compensation, constitutes an interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy that was material, substantial, and unreasonable.

COUNT I  
BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14 – Residential Tenancy)  

31.   Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 30 above as if fully set forth herein.

32.   Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

33.   Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a statutory and common‑law duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with her quiet enjoyment of the Apartment. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Al‑Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).

34.   The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from acts or omissions by the landlord (or those for whom the landlord is responsible) that “materially impair the character and value of the leased premises.” See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); Winchester v. O’Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929).

35.   A landlord’s liability for breach of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 extends to substantial interferences caused by the landlord’s agents, contractors, or persons acting under the landlord’s authority or control. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994); Lowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).

36.   The extensive, recurring, and loud construction noise (including drilling, hammering, and loud talking) emanating from the adjacent unit for full business days over a period of at least two months, combined with the migration of construction dust into Plaintiff’s Apartment, has substantially and materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.

37.   These interferences have significantly diminished the character and value of the Apartment as a residential dwelling and as a place where Plaintiff must conduct her work‑from‑home employment during normal business hours.

38.   Under Massachusetts law, substantial interference with a tenant’s ability to use the leased premises in the manner reasonably contemplated by the tenancy—especially as a place of residence, repose, and, where known to the landlord, home‑based work—can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–03; Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 717–19 (1977).

39.   In Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a landlord may be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where he creates or permits conditions (there, excessive noise from a lounge) that foreseeably interfere with tenants’ quiet enjoyment, even if the landlord does not intend the interference.

40.   Similarly, in this case, Defendant created or permitted the conditions that resulted in persistent and excessive noise and dust—namely, the substantial renovation of the adjacent unit—under circumstances in which it was reasonably foreseeable that such activities would seriously interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her Apartment.

41.   Plaintiff’s impairment has been “substantial” and not trivial, de minimis, or merely aesthetic. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 284; Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–04.

42.   Defendant’s conduct and omissions were at least negligent and unreasonable in failing to plan, schedule, carry out, or mitigate the renovation work in a way that would avoid or significantly reduce the ongoing and severe disruption to Plaintiff’s daily life and work.

43.   The existence of reasonable hours alone does not excuse the landlord when the magnitude, duration, and intensity of the noise and dust substantially deprive the tenant of the beneficial use of the premises. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Lynn v. Nashawaty, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 314–15 (1981).

44.   Defendant’s minimal, one‑time $100 rent reduction, offered in the face of months of significant disruption, was inadequate and did not cure or compensate for the underlying substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

45.   The landlord’s statutory duty under G.L. c. 186, § 14 is non‑waivable and cannot be avoided by limited or token compensation when the interference remains ongoing and substantial. See Al‑Ziab, 424 Mass. at 851–52; Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 787–88 (1994).

46.   At all relevant times, Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that Plaintiff worked from home and that prolonged, loud daytime construction next door would seriously interfere with the primary residential and work functions of the Apartment.

47.   Defendant had the power to take reasonable steps to lessen the interference—such as controlling contractor behavior, limiting particularly noisy work to shorter time blocks, installing additional noise and dust barriers, or offering Plaintiff a meaningful rent abatement or temporary relocation—but failed to do so adequately.

48.   Defendant’s acts and omissions, including but not limited to (a) initiating and continuing extensive renovation work immediately adjacent to Plaintiff’s Apartment; (b) allowing persistent and loud construction noise and dust to intrude into Plaintiff’s Apartment over a prolonged period; and (c) failing to take reasonable mitigating measures or provide meaningful compensation, constituted a direct and indirect interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

49.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to loss of the use and enjoyment of her home, disruption of her work, inconvenience, annoyance, emotional distress, and time and effort spent dealing with the conditions.

50.   Plaintiff estimates her actual damages at no less than $500.00, based on the diminished value of the Apartment during the periods of substantial interference and the harm described above.

51.   Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a residential tenant’s quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

52.   Although Plaintiff is self‑represented and does not presently seek attorney’s fees for counsel, she seeks her actual and consequential damages, together with statutory remedies, costs, and such additional relief as the Court deems just and proper.

53.   Plaintiff reserves all rights to seek additional damages as may be warranted by further evidence or by the continuation of the interference beyond the date of this Complaint.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Wallis, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant, Mark Thompson, and grant the following relief:

A.    A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable common law;

B.    An award of actual and consequential damages to Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), plus such additional amounts as are warranted by the duration and severity of the interference;

C.    Statutory damages and enhancements as provided under G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent applicable, together with interest as allowed by law, including G.L. c. 231, § 6B;

D.    An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action, including filing and service fees, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and other applicable law;

E.    Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper, including but not limited to any appropriate injunctive or declaratory relief to prevent continuing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA WALLIS,
