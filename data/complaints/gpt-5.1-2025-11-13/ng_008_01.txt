QUINCY DINING LLC,

COMPLAINT FOR NEGLIGENCE  
______________________________  

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), for her complaint against Defendant Quincy Dining LLC (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

                               I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Quincy Dining LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company that owns, operates, manages, and/or controls a restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts 02169 (the “Premises”).

3. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant, by and through its agents, servants, and/or employees, was engaged in the business of operating a casual dining restaurant open to the general public for profit.

                       II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This is an action for personal injuries sounding in negligence under the common law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

5. The amount of damages sought, exclusive of interest and costs, is within the jurisdictional limits of the Quincy District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 19A.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, because the cause of action arose in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business and maintains the Premises in Quincy.

                          III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

7. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately evening dinner hours, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee and customer at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.

8. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was exercising due care for her own safety.

9. As a paying customer, Plaintiff was owed a duty of reasonable care by Defendant to maintain the Premises, including walkways, corridors, and hallways, in a reasonably safe condition, and to warn of any unreasonable dangers of which Defendant knew or should have known. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973); G.L. c. 231, § 85.

10. On said date, a server employed by Defendant was carrying a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room of the restaurant (the “Hallway”).

11. The server dropped the tray, causing multiple water glasses to fall and break on the tile floor of the Hallway.

12. The spilled contents created a substantial accumulation of water and ice on the tile floor of the Hallway.

13. The server quickly picked up the broken glass but left the water and ice on the tile floor.

14. At that time, the server stated, in substance, that she would “be right back with a mop,” thereby acknowledging the presence of the hazard and Defendant’s actual knowledge of the dangerous condition.

15. The server failed to place any “wet floor,” caution, or warning sign in or around the Hallway to warn patrons of the wet, slippery condition, despite having actual knowledge of the hazard.

16. Defendant, through its said employee and other staff members, failed to cordon off, block access to, or otherwise take reasonable steps to prevent patrons, including Plaintiff, from walking into the hazardous area.

17. Approximately ten (10) minutes or more after the spill, Plaintiff got up from her table to use the restroom facilities located beyond the Hallway.

18. As Plaintiff approached and entered the Hallway, the tile floor appeared shiny; however, in the lighting conditions of the Premises and given the nature of the tile, Plaintiff reasonably believed she was viewing an ordinary, dry, shiny tile surface.

19. Plaintiff did not see any warning cones, signs, barriers, or employees warning patrons of a wet floor or hazardous condition in the Hallway.

20. As Plaintiff stepped into the Hallway, she encountered the water and ice that remained on the floor from the earlier spill.

21. Plaintiff’s foot slipped out from under her due to the wet and slippery condition of the tile floor.

22. Plaintiff twisted and severely sprained her knee as she slipped on the water and ice.

23. Immediately after Plaintiff’s fall, Plaintiff overheard other staff members employed by Defendant remark, in substance, that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, confirming that the hazardous condition had existed for a significant period of time and was known to multiple employees.

24. Defendant’s employees, agents, and/or servants, including the server who created the spill, had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition on the floor and, at a minimum, constructive knowledge due to the passage of time and the employees’ ongoing awareness of and encounters with the puddle. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–85 (2007).

25. The Hallway is a primary and foreseeable traffic route for patrons traveling between the dining room and the restroom. Defendant knew or should have known that customers, including Plaintiff, would be required to traverse said Hallway.

26. Despite such knowledge, Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to either promptly and adequately clean and dry the floor, or, at a minimum, to warn or protect patrons from the known dangerous condition. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973).

27. After the fall, Plaintiff experienced immediate pain and difficulty bearing weight on her injured knee.

28. Plaintiff subsequently presented to urgent care, where she was evaluated and diagnosed with a sprained knee.

29. Plaintiff was required to wear a knee brace and to undergo a course of physical therapy for a number of weeks, as directed by her medical providers.

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,200 in reasonable and necessary medical expenses for evaluation, treatment, and physical therapy related to her knee injury.

31. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered approximately $1,500 in lost wages due to her inability to work for a period of time while recovering from her injuries.

32. Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, discomfort, loss of normal enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and emotional distress as a result of her injuries.

33. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to maintain the Hallway in a reasonably safe condition and to take reasonable steps to protect and warn invitees of known hazards. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010).

34. At all relevant times, Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants acting within the course and scope of their employment, owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain the Premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of or remedy any dangerous conditions they created, knew of, or should have known of in the exercise of reasonable care. See Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 400 Mass. 837, 842–44 (1987).

35. Plaintiff did not assume the risk of Defendant’s negligence and did not knowingly or voluntarily encounter a known danger; instead, she reasonably relied on Defendant to maintain the Hallway in a safe condition or to warn of any hazards. See Poirier v. Plymouth, 374 Mass. 206, 212–13 (1978).

36. Any negligence attributable to Plaintiff, which is expressly denied, was less than the negligence of Defendant and does not bar recovery under the comparative negligence statute, G.L. c. 231, § 85.

                            IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
                                 (NEGLIGENCE)

37. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. Defendant, as the owner, operator, and/or controller of the Premises, owed Plaintiff, a lawful business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the ownership, operation, maintenance, and control of the Premises, including, but not limited to, the Hallway between the dining room and the restroom. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707–08 (1973).

39. Defendant, acting through its employees and agents, owed Plaintiff a duty to:

    a. Use reasonable care to keep the Premises, including floors and passageways, in a reasonably safe condition for customers;  

    b. Use reasonable care to remedy dangerous conditions, including water and ice on floors, within a reasonable time after having actual or constructive notice of such conditions;  

    c. Conduct reasonable inspections of the Premises to discover and correct hazards; and  

    d. Warn invitees, including Plaintiff, of any unreasonable dangers known to Defendant or that Defendant should have known of in the exercise of reasonable care. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 783–84 (2007); Deagle v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 343 Mass. 263, 264–65 (1961).

40. Defendant, by and through its employees, agents, and/or servants, breached its duty of care owed to Plaintiff in one or more of the following ways, among others:

    a. Creating a hazardous condition by spilling water and ice on the tile floor of the Hallway and failing to clean it up in a timely and adequate manner;  

    b. Failing to promptly mop, dry, or otherwise remove the water and ice from the floor after the spill, despite actual knowledge of the hazard;  

    c. Failing to place any “wet floor” sign, caution cone, barricade, or other warning device in or around the Hallway to alert patrons to the wet, slippery condition;  

    d. Failing to station an employee in the area to warn patrons or temporarily restrict access to the Hallway until the hazard was remedied;  

    e. Allowing the wet, slippery condition to remain for at least ten (10) minutes, and likely longer, after the spill, while patrons and employees were using or “dodging” the area;  

    f. Failing to implement, follow, or enforce reasonable policies and procedures for the prompt cleanup of spills and the warning of patrons about such hazards;  

    g. Failing to adequately train and supervise employees in proper spill response and customer safety procedures; and  

    h. Failing to otherwise act as a reasonably prudent restaurant owner/operator would under the same or similar circumstances.  

    See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167–68 (1973); Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 783–85.

41. The actual knowledge of Defendant’s employee who caused the spill, coupled with the statements of other staff that they had been “dodging that puddle” for a while, establishes that Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous condition and had a reasonable opportunity to remedy or warn of it. See Uloth v. City Tank Corp., 376 Mass. 874, 879 (1978) (knowledge of employees imputed to employer).

42. Alternatively, the condition of the floor and the length of time the water and ice remained on the floor, together with the employees’ observations and comments, were such that, in the exercise of reasonable care, Defendant should have discovered and remedied the condition, thereby establishing at least constructive notice. See Sheehan, 448 Mass. at 783–84; Foley v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 293 Mass. 232, 233–35 (1936).

43. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and resulting injuries. But for Defendant’s negligent failure to clean the spill, to warn of the wet condition, or to restrict access to the Hallway, Plaintiff would not have slipped and injured her knee. See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320–21 (2002).

44. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, including but not limited to a sprained knee, pain, swelling, restricted motion, and related complications, and required medical diagnosis and treatment, including the use of a brace and physical therapy.

45. As a further direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred and will continue to incur reasonable and necessary medical expenses, currently estimated at approximately $2,200, for the evaluation, care, and treatment of her injuries, and will likely incur additional medical expenses in the future. See G.L. c. 231, § 60F.

46. As an additional direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered a loss of wages and earning capacity, including but not limited to approximately $1,500 in lost wages due to her inability to work during her recovery.

47. Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and emotional distress, all as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence. See Haddad v. Gonzalez, 410 Mass. 855, 871–72 (1991).

48. Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 85, any contributory negligence on the part of Plaintiff, which is denied, does not bar recovery so long as such negligence was not greater than the negligence of Defendant; any damages awarded should be diminished in proportion to any causal negligence, if any, attributable to Plaintiff.

49. Defendant is vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees, agents, and/or servants, including the server who caused and failed to remedy or adequately warn of the spill, as such acts and omissions occurred within the course and scope of their employment. See Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc., 438 Mass. 317, 319–21 (2002).

50. Defendant’s conduct, considered as a whole, constituted a failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, in violation of Massachusetts negligence law and the standard articulated in the foregoing authorities.

                            V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Quincy Dining LLC, and grant the following relief:

   2. Past and future lost wages and impairment of earning capacity, including but not limited to approximately $1,500 incurred to date;  
   3. Pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional distress; and

                     VI. JURY DEMAND
