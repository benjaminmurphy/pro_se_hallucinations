JESSICA REED,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  

MARK THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.

CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jessica Reed (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, complains against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jessica Reed is an adult individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. At all times relevant, Plaintiff has been a tenant at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or landlord of the Premises located at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought in the Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, §§ 3 and 20, which grant the Housing Court jurisdiction over civil actions arising out of the occupation, use, and condition of residential premises and over all claims arising out of or involving the landlord–tenant relationship.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department under G.L. c. 223, § 1, and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because the Premises are located in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood of Boston, in Suffolk County, and the cause of action arose there.

---

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

5. On or about February 1, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy for a studio apartment at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Apartment” or “Premises”), owned and managed by Defendant.

6. Plaintiff agreed to pay, and has paid, monthly rent in the amount of $1,600 to Defendant for the Apartment.

7. During the pre-lease showing of the Apartment, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling in the living/sleeping area.

8. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the water stains and the possibility of leaks.

9. Defendant affirmatively represented to Plaintiff that the water stains were from an “old leak” that had been “totally fixed,” and that there would not be a continuing leak problem.

10. Relying reasonably on Defendant’s representation that the leak had been repaired, Plaintiff agreed to rent the Apartment and entered into the tenancy beginning February 1, 2023.

11. Shortly after moving in, during the first significant rainstorm following the commencement of the tenancy, water began dripping through the ceiling at the exact location where the prior water stains were visible.

12. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the active leak. Plaintiff explained that water was entering the Apartment from the ceiling and that the condition was affecting her use of the Apartment.

13. Over the course of the tenancy, Plaintiff complained to Defendant multiple times, orally and in writing, about the recurring water intrusion through the ceiling.

14. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant routinely dismissed the issue, stating that it was a “minor cosmetic issue” and that Plaintiff knew the Apartment had “character” when she signed the lease.

15. The leak was not minor. During subsequent rainstorms, the ceiling leak worsened, causing significant water intrusion into the Apartment.

16. On at least one occasion during a storm, the water intrusion was so severe that water from the ceiling soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ran onto her coffee table.

17. As a direct result of the water intrusion, Plaintiff’s laptop computer—left on the coffee table—was damaged and ruined. Plaintiff had to replace the laptop at a cost of approximately $900.

18. Over time, the recurring water intrusion led to dampness and a persistent musty odor in the Apartment.

19. Plaintiff began to suffer from frequent headaches and believes, upon information and belief, that they are caused or aggravated by mold or other conditions related to the water intrusion and moisture in the Apartment.

20. Because of the leaking ceiling and associated conditions, Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed away from the affected area and to rearrange her belongings to avoid water and dampness, effectively limiting her use of a significant portion of the Apartment.

21. As a result, Plaintiff has been substantially deprived of the full, safe, and comfortable use and enjoyment of the Apartment for which she has continuously paid full rent.

22. Defendant has failed and refused to adequately investigate, repair, and remediate the water intrusion problem, the resulting damage, and the conditions associated with persistent moisture and possible mold.

23. The repeated intrusion of water, the resulting damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, the persistent musty odor, the health-related symptoms, and the inability to fully use the Apartment materially interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

24. Defendant’s failure to properly maintain the roof/ceiling and to remedy the leak, despite repeated notice, has been intentional, knowing, or at least done with reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.

25. At all relevant times, Defendant has collected full rent from Plaintiff despite the existence of substantial, ongoing defects and interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Apartment.

26. Plaintiff has not caused or contributed to the water intrusion, ceiling leak, or the resulting hazardous and unhealthy conditions in the Apartment.

27. Plaintiff has incurred monetary damages, including but not limited to: (a) the cost of replacing her damaged laptop (approximately $900); (b) loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Apartment; and (c) other consequential harms associated with the conditions and Defendant’s responses.

### IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

28. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. G.L. c. 186, § 14; see also Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850–51 (1997).

29. General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord shall not “directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises … by the occupant,” and that a landlord who does so is liable for actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney’s fees.

30. A landlord’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition, where it substantially interferes with the tenant’s use and enjoyment, can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284–85 (1994); Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Wideman, 417 Mass. 771, 775–76 (1994).

31. Water leaks, chronic dampness, and conditions reasonably likely to cause mold or health problems may constitute substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment and a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See, e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 718–19 (1977) (substantial interference with quiet enjoyment does not require physical eviction); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (conditions substantially impairing use support tenant remedies).

32. A landlord may be liable for breach of quiet enjoyment when the interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises is the natural and probable consequence of the landlord’s actions or inactions after having notice of the condition. Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19.

33. A landlord’s persistent failure to correct serious housing defects after notice, especially those affecting health and safety, can amount to an unlawful interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85; Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 775–76; see also Brown v. LeClair, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 978 (1985).

34. Landlords also have statutory duties regarding the condition of residential premises under the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., and the implied warranty of habitability, recognized in Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–200 (1973). Substantial violations that interfere with a tenant’s use may support a finding of breach of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–05 (1982).

35. Under G.L. c. 239, § 8A, and consistent with Hemingway and its progeny, a landlord’s failure to repair serious conditions within the premises that materially affect the health or safety of the occupants can justify rent abatement and other tenant remedies. While Plaintiff does not assert a separate claim under § 8A here, those principles inform what constitutes a substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.

36. The existence of persistent leaks, water damage, and potential mold violates basic health and safety standards and deprives a tenant of a habitable dwelling, thereby undermining quiet enjoyment. See 105 C.M.R. 410.500–410.550 (moisture, water infiltration, and structural requirements).

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)

37. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–36 as if fully set forth herein.

38. At all times relevant, there existed an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in Plaintiff’s tenancy under Massachusetts common law and G.L. c. 186, § 14.

39. Defendant, as landlord and owner of the Premises, had a duty not to directly or indirectly interfere with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

40. Defendant had actual and repeated notice of the leaking ceiling and resulting water intrusion, damage, musty odor, and associated health concerns.

41. Despite such notice, Defendant failed and refused to make timely and adequate repairs to the roof and/or ceiling, or to remediate the resulting conditions, thereby allowing the problems to persist and worsen.

42. Defendant’s conduct and inaction—including but not limited to failing to repair the leak, dismissing Plaintiff’s reports as “minor” or merely “cosmetic,” and continuing to collect full rent while substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use of the Apartment persisted—constitute an unlawful and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

43. The water intrusion, damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, persistent musty odor, health-related symptoms, and the need for Plaintiff to avoid and not use portions of the Apartment are substantial interferences, not trivial inconveniences.

44. The substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment was a natural and probable consequence of Defendant’s failure to repair the ceiling and roof, particularly after repeated notice of ongoing leaks. See Blackett, 371 Mass. at 718–19; Doe, 417 Mass. at 284–85.

45. Defendant’s failure to act, despite repeated complaints, was at least reckless and in willful disregard of Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

46. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:

   a. Damage to personal property, including the loss of a laptop computer, requiring replacement at a cost of approximately $900;

   b. Loss of use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of the Apartment, including the need to move her bed and belongings away from the leaking area and effectively live in only part of the unit;

   c. Discomfort, inconvenience, and distress resulting from chronic water intrusion, musty odors, and suspected mold-related health effects, including headaches; and

   d. Payment of full rent ($1,600 per month) during months when the Apartment was significantly impaired in its use and enjoyment.

47. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual and consequential damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Although Plaintiff is self-represented at this time, she seeks all statutory remedies, including multiple damages to the extent allowed.

48. Based on the nature and duration of the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and the economic harm suffered, Plaintiff estimates her actual damages at least in the amount of $900 in property damage, plus additional non‑property damages for loss of use, discomfort, and interference with her tenancy. Plaintiff reserves the right to adjust or supplement the damage calculation as permitted by the Court.

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;

B. An award of damages to Plaintiff pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, including:

   1. Plaintiff’s actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to at least $900 for the damaged laptop and additional amounts for loss of use and enjoyment of the Apartment; or  

   2. Three (3) months’ rent at $1,600 per month (totaling $4,800), whichever amount is greater, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14;

C. An award of costs of this action as allowed by law;

D. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, to the extent Plaintiff later retains counsel or as otherwise permitted;

E. Such further legal and equitable relief as the Court deems just and proper to remedy the interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment and to ensure that Defendant complies with his obligations as a landlord under Massachusetts law.
