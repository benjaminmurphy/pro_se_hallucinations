COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14 – NONPAYMENT CASE NOT INVOLVING TERMINATION, INTERFERENCE, OR NONRENEWAL FOR RENT NONPAYMENT)

Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Carter”) states as follows for her Complaint against Defendant Laura Bennett (“Defendant” or “Ms. Bennett”):


### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment ___, Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Premises”).

2. Defendant Laura Bennett is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and is the owner and/or managing landlord of the residential Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

3. At all relevant times, Defendant was the landlord and lessor of the Premises, and Plaintiff was a residential tenant entitled to the protections of G.L. c. 186 and G.L. c. 93A and related Massachusetts common law.

  
### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This action arises out of residential landlord‑tenant relations within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and asserts a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

5. The amount in controversy is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

6. Venue is proper in the Lowell District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and applicable court rules because the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to this action occurred there.

  
### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential tenancy with Defendant for the rental of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852.

8. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent of $1,200 to Defendant for the Premises.

9. The Premises include a bathroom without any exterior window. The bathroom relies solely on a mechanical exhaust fan for ventilation.

10. After Plaintiff moved into the Premises and during the tenancy, mold began to grow in the bathroom, initially appearing in the corner of the shower.

11. Over time, the mold spread from the corner of the shower to other areas of the bathroom, including the bathroom ceiling.

12. The mold growth has been substantial and visible, and exists in an area of the Premises routinely used by Plaintiff for personal hygiene and daily life.

13. Plaintiff routinely uses the bathroom exhaust fan when showering and otherwise uses the bathroom in a normal and reasonable manner, taking hot showers of ordinary duration.

14. The bathroom’s lack of natural ventilation (no window) and the presence of persistent mold indicate a chronic moisture and ventilation problem that is beyond the tenant’s ordinary control.

15. Plaintiff promptly reported the mold problem to Defendant after noticing it and requested appropriate remediation.

16. Defendant inspected the bathroom mold condition but refused to take adequate measures to remedy the underlying cause of the mold growth, including the inadequate ventilation.

17. Instead, Defendant blamed Plaintiff for the mold condition, asserting that Plaintiff did not run the exhaust fan enough and took showers that were “too hot and too long.”

18. Defendant has stated that she will clean or has attempted to clean visible mold, but has refused to address the underlying cause of the condition, including necessary improvements to ventilation or other repairs to prevent recurring mold growth.

19. Defendant has refused to accept responsibility for the mold condition and has refused to take meaningful, lasting corrective action, despite having been notified by Plaintiff of the problem.

20. Since the appearance and spread of mold in the bathroom, Plaintiff has developed respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing.

21. Plaintiff had not suffered from these respiratory issues prior to the mold problem in the bathroom at the Premises.

22. Plaintiff sought medical attention, and her doctor advised that the respiratory symptoms were likely related to the mold exposure and recommended that the mold be remediated.

23. Plaintiff has been forced to live with ongoing mold in her bathroom, which interferes with her ability to safely use the bathroom and enjoy her home.

24. As a direct result of the mold contamination, Plaintiff was required to discard personal property that became moldy, including a shower curtain and towels with a total approximate value of $60.

25. Plaintiff has experienced discomfort, concern for her health, anxiety, and disruption of her normal living activities due to the mold and her respiratory symptoms.

26. Despite notice of the condition and Plaintiff’s request for appropriate action, Defendant has failed and refused to adequately repair the condition or to provide a habitable, sanitary bathroom environment.

27. The ongoing mold condition in the bathroom, coupled with Defendant’s refusal to correct the underlying cause, constitutes a serious interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and with her right to the quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

28. Plaintiff has continued to pay rent and otherwise comply with the obligations of her tenancy.

29. Plaintiff believes she has suffered at least $300 in damages as a result of Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to property loss, diminution in rental value of the Premises, and consequential harm.

30. Plaintiff also reserves the right to seek statutory damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, including up to three months’ rent or three times her actual damages, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as allowed by statute, even though she is currently self‑represented.

  
### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**

31. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully set forth herein.

32. Under Massachusetts law, every residential tenancy includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides that a landlord shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the tenant.

33. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any lessor who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable in tort for actual and statutory damages, including “three months’ rent or three times the damages sustained by [the tenant], whichever is greater,” together with the costs of the action and reasonable attorney’s fees.

34. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from “serious interference with their tenancy—acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leased premises.” See, e.g., Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982).

35. A landlord’s failure to remedy significant defects or conditions that affect health or safety, after notice, can constitute an “indirect interference” with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14. See Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 788–89 (1994); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).

36. Conditions that violate the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.000 et seq., may evidence a breach of quiet enjoyment when they materially impair the character or value of the leased premises. See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199–201 (1973); Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 789.

37. Under the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the dwelling in compliance with minimum standards of fitness for human habitation, including keeping the dwelling free from chronic dampness and conditions conducive to mold growth. See 105 C.M.R. 410.010, 410.020, 410.500, 410.550, 410.602 (minimum standards; structural soundness; moisture and ventilation requirements).

38. The presence of ongoing mold in the bathroom of a residential dwelling, especially where there is no window and only mechanical ventilation, constitutes a condition that endangers or materially impairs a tenant’s health, safety, and well‑being, and therefore materially interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.

39. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the mold condition in the bathroom and requested that Defendant remedy the problem.

40. Defendant failed to take adequate steps to correct the mold and the underlying causes, and instead blamed Plaintiff, refused to make necessary repairs or improvements, and limited her response to, at most, cleaning visible mold without addressing the ventilation or chronic moisture problems.

41. Defendant’s failure to correct the mold condition and underlying ventilation problem after notice, in a bathroom with no exterior window and chronic mold growth, constitutes an omission that materially interferes with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

42. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s persistent failure to remove conditions adversely affecting health or safety, after notice, can constitute an actionable breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. at 102–03 (repeated flooding and failure to correct); Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 788–89 (rodent infestation and code violations); Al-Ziab, 424 Mass. at 850–51.

43. The mold condition here is comparable in seriousness to the conditions in the above‑cited cases, as it directly affects Plaintiff’s health, safety, and capacity to use essential parts of her home.

44. Plaintiff has in fact suffered respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which her doctor has opined are likely related to the mold in the Premises.

45. Plaintiff has also suffered the loss of personal property, including a shower curtain and towels, due to mold contamination in the bathroom.

46. Plaintiff’s health impacts, property loss, and the impairment of her ability to safely and comfortably use the bathroom constitute actual damages caused by Defendant’s interference with her quiet enjoyment.

47. Defendant’s conduct constitutes at least negligent, and in light of her refusal to act after notice and her effort to blame Plaintiff, willful or knowing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

48. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for her actual damages and for statutory damages of up to three months’ rent or three times Plaintiff’s actual damages, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. See, e.g., Doe v. N.B. Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. at 285; Cruz Mgmt., 417 Mass. at 789.

49. The implied warranty of habitability, as recognized in Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. at 199–201, and its statutory counterpart in G.L. c. 239, § 8A, further underscore that landlords must maintain premises in a condition fit for human habitation and in compliance with the State Sanitary Code; violation of these standards supports and informs the inference of an interference with quiet enjoyment.

50. Plaintiff estimates her damages, exclusive of statutory damages, at not less than $300, including but not limited to: (a) out‑of‑pocket losses for contaminated property; (b) diminution in rental value during the period of defective conditions; and (c) discomfort, anxiety, and inconvenience caused by the mold and related health problems.

51. Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual and statutory damages, as well as costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, even though she presently appears pro se. See, e.g., Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761–62 (1979) (remedial purpose of tenant‑protection statutes).

  
### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Carter respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Laura Bennett and grant the following relief:

A. A finding and declaration that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 by directly or indirectly interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises through her failure to adequately remedy the mold and related conditions in the bathroom after notice;

B. An award of actual damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $300, for Plaintiff’s losses, including but not limited to property damage, diminution in rental value, and consequential harms associated with the mold condition and its impact on Plaintiff’s health and use of the Premises;

C. An award of statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14 of up to three months’ rent or three times Plaintiff’s actual damages, whichever is greater;

D. An award of costs of this action, including but not limited to filing fees and other allowable costs;

E. An award of reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14, should Plaintiff later be represented by counsel;

F. Such further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper, including, if within the Court’s authority in this action, orders ensuring that Defendant abates the mold and remediates underlying conditions in compliance with the State Sanitary Code.

  
### VI. JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.

  
Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,
