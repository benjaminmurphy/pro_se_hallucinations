JORDAN MITCHELL,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.                                                  CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________

SAMUEL THOMPSON,  
    Defendant.  
------------------------------------------------------  

COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, brings this Complaint against Defendant Samuel Thompson (“Defendant”) and alleges as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Jordan Mitchell is an individual residing at 25 Union Square, Second Floor, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02143.

2. Defendant Samuel Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns, manages, and/or controls the residential triple‑decker property located at 25 Union Square, Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 02143 (the “Property”), and is the landlord of Plaintiff.

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This action is brought pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

4. The Somerville District Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 & 21, and G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because this is a civil action arising out of a residential landlord‑tenant relationship concerning real property located within this Court’s territorial jurisdiction and the amount in controversy is within this Court’s jurisdictional limits.

5. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 & 2, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the Property at issue is located within this county.

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendant for the tenancy of the second‑floor apartment at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA 02143 (the “Apartment”).

7. Under the Lease, Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent in the amount of $1,800. Plaintiff has at all relevant times paid or tendered rent as required, or substantially complied with his obligations, and has not materially breached the Lease.

8. The Lease expressly provides that Plaintiff is entitled to “quiet enjoyment” of the Apartment.

9. Independently of the Lease, Massachusetts law implies into every residential tenancy a covenant of quiet enjoyment, and further provides statutory protection against interference with quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 14.

10. Plaintiff’s tenancy began on or about January 1, 2022 and has been continuous since that date.

11. The Property is a three‑family “triple‑decker” building. Plaintiff occupies the second‑floor unit. Another tenant or tenants occupy the third‑floor unit above Plaintiff (the “Upstairs Tenants”), and all tenants, including Plaintiff and the Upstairs Tenants, share the same landlord, Defendant Samuel Thompson.

12. Approximately six months before the filing of this Complaint—around June 1, 2025—the Upstairs Tenants moved into the third‑floor unit.

13. Since shortly after the Upstairs Tenants moved in, there has been frequent, severe, and recurring noise directly affecting Plaintiff’s Apartment, including but not limited to:

   a. Loud stomping and heavy footfalls at all hours of the day and night;  
   b. Music played at high volume late at night; and  
   c. The sound of furniture or other heavy objects being moved, dragged, or dropped, including around midnight and in the early morning hours.

14. The noise is of such intensity, frequency, and duration that it is plainly audible within Plaintiff’s bedroom and other rooms of the Apartment and is not consistent with ordinary household sounds.

15. The noise regularly continues into late‑night hours and early morning hours such that Plaintiff’s sleep is repeatedly and substantially disturbed.

16. Plaintiff averages only approximately four to five hours of sleep per night as a direct result of the persistent noise from the Upstairs Tenants.

17. In order to mitigate the disturbance, Plaintiff has purchased and used earplugs, a white noise machine, and has rearranged his bedroom to a different location within the Apartment. These measures have proven inadequate to restore quiet enjoyment or normal sleep patterns.

18. Plaintiff personally and respectfully approached the Upstairs Tenants and requested that they reduce the noise and be mindful of their impact. Following this request, the Upstairs Tenants were somewhat quieter for approximately one week, but then resumed their prior pattern of loud and disruptive noise.

19. The ongoing and recurrent nature of the disturbances has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to sleep, rest, and use and enjoy the Apartment as a home.

20. Plaintiff has suffered physical and emotional effects from the chronic sleep deprivation, including fatigue, daytime drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, and stress.

21. As a direct result of falling asleep at work due to sleep deprivation caused by the noise, Plaintiff received a written warning from his employer.

22. The written warning jeopardizes Plaintiff’s employment and earning capacity and has caused Plaintiff distress and anxiety.

23. Plaintiff consulted a medical doctor regarding his severe sleep problems. The doctor prescribed sleep medication to address Plaintiff’s noise‑related insomnia.

24. Plaintiff now incurs ongoing out‑of‑pocket expenses of approximately $40 per month for prescribed sleep medication.

25. Plaintiff has also expended funds on earplugs and a white noise machine in attempts to mitigate the disturbances and protect his health and employment.

26. The foregoing damages and expenses were foreseeable consequences of the chronic, excessive noise and the Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to abate it after notice.

27. Recognizing that the source of the noise was the Upstairs Tenants—who are also Defendant’s tenants—Plaintiff repeatedly sought the assistance of Defendant, as his landlord, to address and correct the problem.

28. Over the course of the last several months, Plaintiff complained to Defendant on approximately five or six separate occasions about the noise and its impact on Plaintiff’s health, sleep, and employment.

29. Plaintiff notified Defendant that the noise was ongoing, serious, and was depriving Plaintiff of the peaceful use of his home, including restful sleep during normal nighttime hours.

30. Plaintiff’s complaints placed Defendant on actual notice of the ongoing and substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Apartment.

31. On at least one occasion, Defendant told Plaintiff that he had spoken to the Upstairs Tenants, but Defendant also stated to Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”

32. Beyond that one minimal and ineffective communication, Defendant failed and refused to take reasonable steps within his power and control as landlord to abate or remedy the disturbance, such as: issuing written warnings, imposing lease‑based consequences, enforcing house rules, modifying or not renewing the Upstairs Tenants’ lease, or otherwise requiring compliance with reasonable standards of conduct.

33. Despite repeated notice from Plaintiff, Defendant has allowed the excessive and unreasonable noise to continue for months without effective corrective action.

34. Defendant’s statements and inaction demonstrate an unwillingness to fulfill his legal obligations as landlord to protect Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment where the interference is caused by other tenants under Defendant’s control and subject to his leases.

35. The noisy conditions have continued up to and including the time of filing this Complaint and are ongoing.

36. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to address the problem after repeated notice, Plaintiff has been deprived of the quiet enjoyment of the Apartment to which he is entitled under both the Lease and Massachusetts law.

37. Plaintiff estimates that, based on the duration, severity, and impact of the disturbances and related expenses, he has suffered at least $1,200 in damages to date, including but not limited to loss of use and enjoyment of the premises, emotional distress, medical expenses, and related consequential damages.

38. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the claimed amount of damages as additional facts, evidence, or calculations become available.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

39. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 38 as if fully set forth herein.

40. Under Massachusetts law, residential tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment both by statute and at common law. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord “shall not directly or indirectly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.”

41. The statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants against serious interferences with the use, beneficial enjoyment, and habitability of the leased premises that are caused by the landlord or by conditions the landlord knows or should know about and fails to correct within a reasonable time. See, e.g.:

   a. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. 714 (1977) (landlord liable for breach of quiet enjoyment where noise from nearby lounge, operated by landlord’s tenant, substantially interfered with tenants’ ability to use apartments, even though landlord did not himself create the noise, because the landlord had the power and duty to control or abate the condition);

   b. **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (severe and repeated flooding and landlord’s failure to correct it constituted a breach of quiet enjoyment and supported damages for emotional distress);

   c. **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (quiet enjoyment statute protects tenants from serious interferences “substantially impairing” the character and value of the leased premises, and the landlord’s knowledge and failure to act can constitute “indirect” interference);

   d. **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997) (reaffirming that a landlord’s inaction in the face of known conditions that seriously interfere with tenancy can amount to interference under G.L. c. 186, § 14).

42. Massachusetts appellate decisions have long recognized that noise and disturbances associated with other tenants can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord has the right and ability to control the source of the disturbance but fails to do so. See, e.g.:

   a. **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 717–719 (noise from another tenant’s use of the premises, where landlord created or allowed the circumstances giving rise to the interference and failed to abate it, was a breach of quiet enjoyment);

   b. **Winchester v. O’Brien**, 266 Mass. 33, 36–37 (1929) (landlord responsible when he permits acts which interfere with tenants’ enjoyment of leased premises);

   c. **Westland Housing Corp. v. Scott**, 312 Mass. 375, 381–382 (1942) (covenant of quiet enjoyment extends to acts or omissions of the landlord that interfere with tenant’s beneficial use).

43. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that a landlord who “directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant” shall be liable for “actual and consequential damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater,” together with costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

44. Defendant, as owner and landlord of the Property, entered into a lease with Plaintiff that expressly guarantees Plaintiff’s right to “quiet enjoyment” of the Apartment.

45. Defendant also entered into a lease or leases with the Upstairs Tenants, granting them the right to occupy the third‑floor unit subject to lawful and reasonable limitations and obligations that Defendant, as landlord, has the authority to enforce.

46. Upon Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant had actual knowledge that the Upstairs Tenants were engaging in conduct—excessive and unreasonable noise—substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment, particularly during night‑time hours.

47. Defendant had the legal right and practical ability to address and control the interference caused by the Upstairs Tenants through, among other means:

   a. Enforcing lease provisions and house rules regarding noise and nuisance;  
   b. Issuing written warnings or notices to cure to the Upstairs Tenants;  
   c. Declining to renew or deciding to terminate the Upstairs Tenants’ tenancy for persistent and unreasonable disturbances; and  
   d. Taking other reasonable steps customary for a landlord to abate or mitigate tenant‑created disturbances.

48. After receiving multiple complaints from Plaintiff over a period of months, Defendant, at most, spoke once informally to the Upstairs Tenants and then informed Plaintiff that he “can’t control how people live.”

49. Defendant’s limited and ineffective response, followed by inaction, falls below the standard of reasonable care required of a landlord to protect a tenant’s statutory and contractual right to quiet enjoyment when the landlord has both notice of and control over the source of the interference.

50. Defendant’s failure and refusal to take reasonable steps to abate or remedy the known and ongoing disturbances from the Upstairs Tenants constitutes an “indirect” interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment within the meaning of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See **Blackett v. Olanoff**, 371 Mass. at 718–719; **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. at 283–284.

51. The level of noise and disruption endured by Plaintiff—occurring late at night and into early morning hours, over a period of months, despite repeated complaints—amounts to a “serious interference” with and “substantial impairment” of Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment, as that standard has been articulated in Massachusetts cases. See **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.**, 417 Mass. at 283 (quiet enjoyment violation requires a “serious interference with the tenancy”).

52. The resulting chronic sleep deprivation, need for prescription sleep medication, expenditures for mitigation measures (earplugs, white noise machine), and the written workplace warning, constitute actual and consequential damages that are the foreseeable and direct result of Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. at 101–103 (damages for emotional distress and consequential harms recoverable for breach of quiet enjoyment); **Manzaro v. McCann**, 401 Mass. 880, 884–885 (1988) (consequential damages covered by § 14).

53. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14, as well as the express and implied covenant of quiet enjoyment contained in the Lease and recognized at common law. See **Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.**, 437 Mass. 708, 720–721 (2002) (quiet enjoyment covenant protects tenant’s right to use premises without interference by landlord); **Winchester v. O’Brien**, 266 Mass. at 36–37.

54. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:

   a. Loss of the use and enjoyment of his Apartment as a reasonably quiet and habitable residence;  
   b. Sleep deprivation and associated physical and emotional distress;  
   c. Out‑of‑pocket expenses for sleep medication (approximately $40 per month), earplugs, and a white noise machine;  
   d. Employment‑related harm, including a written warning that jeopardizes Plaintiff’s job security; and  
   e. Other incidental and consequential damages.

55. Plaintiff’s damages to date are reasonably estimated at not less than $1,200, representing a conservative measure of actual and consequential damages; pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover either three months’ rent ($5,400) or actual and consequential damages (currently estimated at $1,200), whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

56. Plaintiff, as a self‑represented litigant, is currently not incurring attorneys’ fees, but expressly reserves the right to seek reasonable attorneys’ fees under G.L. c. 186, § 14 should counsel enter an appearance in this matter in the future.

57. Defendant’s interference is ongoing, and Plaintiff may continue to suffer additional damages unless and until the Court’s intervention compels Defendant to fulfill his obligations and protect Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment.

3. An award of costs of this action, including filing fees and other allowable costs, as provided by law;
