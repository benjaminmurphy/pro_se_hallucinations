v.  

MICHAEL TURNER,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  
(CUSTODY / PARENTING TIME)  

Plaintiff, Jessica Turner (“Mother”), for her Complaint for Modification of the existing custody and parenting time judgment regarding the minor children of the parties, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Her telephone number is (617) 555‑0123 and her email address is psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant, Michael Turner (“Father”), upon information and belief, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

3. The parties are the parents of two minor children:
   - Liam Turner, born [redacted for privacy] (age 8); and  
   - Ava Turner, born [redacted for privacy] (age 6).

4. This Court has continuing jurisdiction over custody and parenting time for these minor children pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20 (to the extent applicable); and the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction provisions, including G.L. c. 209B.

5. Venue is proper in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court because the existing custody and parenting-time judgment was entered in this Court and the children reside within its jurisdiction.

### II. PRIOR JUDGMENT AND CURRENT ORDER

6. On or about May 15, 2020, this Court entered a judgment and/or order establishing legal and physical custody and a parenting-time schedule for the parties’ minor children (the “2020 Custody Order”).

7. Under the 2020 Custody Order, Mother has primary physical custody of the children, and Father has parenting time consisting generally of:
   a. Every other weekend; and  
   b. One overnight during the week, on a regular weekly basis.

8. At the time of the 2020 Custody Order, both parties worked regular daytime schedules, and the parenting plan was crafted and approved in light of their then‑existing work hours and availability, which allowed Father to exercise overnight parenting time while being awake, available, and able to supervise the children.

9. The 2020 Custody Order was in the children’s best interests when entered, given the parties’ work schedules and circumstances at that time.

### III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

10. Since entry of the 2020 Custody Order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and controlling case law, including, but not limited to, Father’s significant change in employment and work schedule.

11. Specifically, Father has taken new employment with shifts that run from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on multiple nights each week, including many of the nights on which he is scheduled to have overnight parenting time under the 2020 Custody Order.

12. As a result of his new night‑shift schedule, Father is frequently:
   a. Working all or most of the hours that the children are scheduled to be in his overnight care;  
   b. Too fatigued to safely and appropriately care for the children during his parenting time; and/or  
   c. Unavailable to personally supervise and care for the children overnight.

13. On multiple occasions, Father has, with little or no advance notice, dropped the children off at Mother’s residence during his scheduled parenting time because he states he is too tired to care for them after his overnight shifts.

14. On other occasions, Father has left the children in the care of a roommate or other third party whom Mother barely knows, and whom the children report has been responsible for them while Father is sleeping or at work.

15. The children have reported to Mother that they often fall asleep on the couch while Father is napping or recovering from his overnight shifts and that Father is frequently asleep or unavailable during times when he is supposed to be actively caring for them.

16. These circumstances were not contemplated by the parties or the Court at the time of the 2020 Custody Order and represent a substantial, material, and continuing change in circumstances.

17. The current schedule, when applied to Father’s new work hours, results in the children either:
   a. Being inadequately supervised when Father is exhausted, sleeping, or otherwise unavailable;  
   b. Being left with an unfamiliar caregiver, contrary to the expectations under the 2020 Custody Order; and/or  
   c. Experiencing abrupt, last‑minute changes in their schedule when Father cancels or cuts short his parenting time.

18. These conditions negatively affect the children’s stability, routine, sense of security, and overall welfare, and therefore directly implicate their best interests.

### IV. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

19. Under Massachusetts law, a party seeking modification of a custody or parenting‑time order must demonstrate (1) a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order, and (2) that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; see also *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

20. The paramount consideration in any custody or parenting‑time determination is the best interests of the child. *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266 (2001); G.L. c. 208, § 31.

21. A material change in a parent’s work schedule, particularly one that interferes with the parent’s ability to exercise ordered parenting time and provide appropriate supervision, may constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *M.C. v. T.K.*, 463 Mass. 226 (2012); see also *M.P.M. v. F.M.*, 442 Mass. 522 (2004).

22. Massachusetts courts recognize that instability, frequent last‑minute changes, and inadequate supervision can adversely affect children and justify revisiting parenting time. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 843‑45 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 595‑96 (1996).

23. In determining the best interests of the child, courts consider, among other factors, the child’s welfare, stability, emotional development, and the ability of each parent to provide a safe and consistent home environment. G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Morgan v. Morgan*, 402 Mass. 123, 127 (1988); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 843‑44.

24. Where a previous order was appropriate when entered, but subsequent developments have rendered its application inconsistent with the child’s best interests, the Court has both the authority and the obligation to modify the order. G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. at 544‑45; *Champigny v. Champigny*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 115‑16 (2007).

25. Massachusetts law also authorizes the Court to modify parenting time to impose reasonable conditions designed to protect the children and ensure that parenting time occurs only when a parent is able to provide appropriate supervision and care. See G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; *Keefe v. Keefe*, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2011) (Rule 1:28 decision); *Care & Protection of Three Minors*, 392 Mass. 704, 712‑13 (1984).

26. The Court may also consider the extent to which a parent actually exercises parenting time as ordered and whether their conduct promotes the children’s welfare and continuity of care. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. at 844‑45; *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 191‑92 (1998).

### V. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS

27. Father’s transition to repeated overnight shifts from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., including on nights of his scheduled overnights with the children, is a significant and ongoing change that directly undermines the assumptions underlying the 2020 Custody Order.

28. Father’s repeated last‑minute cancellations or early terminations of his overnight parenting time, due to fatigue or conflicting work obligations, demonstrate that the current schedule is unworkable under his new employment conditions.

29. Father’s practice of leaving the children in the care of his roommate or other third parties, whom Mother barely knows and who were not contemplated by the Court’s prior order, substantially alters the nature and quality of the children’s care during his parenting time.

30. The children’s reports that they often fall asleep on the couch while Father is napping or unavailable, and that he is frequently exhausted after his shifts, raise legitimate concerns about adequate supervision and the children’s safety and emotional security.

31. These developments collectively amount to a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2020 Custody Order, within the meaning of G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the cases cited above, including *Mason v. Coleman* and *Custody of Kali*.

32. Continuing to require adherence to the current overnight parenting‑time schedule, without accommodation for Father’s new work hours, is no longer in the best interests of the children, as it:
   a. Exposes them to inconsistent care and last‑minute schedule changes;  
   b. Increases their reliance on an unfamiliar roommate or third party as primary overnight caregiver; and  
   c. Fails to ensure that a responsible, rested adult is available to supervise them during overnights.

33. A modified schedule under which Father exercises overnight parenting time only when he is not working overnight, is rested, and is able to be present and available to the children, will better promote their stability, safety, emotional well‑being, and overall best interests, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and *Yannas v. Frondistou‑Yannas*.

34. Modification to align overnight parenting time with Father’s actual availability will also reduce the number of abrupt, last‑minute changes and will promote a more predictable routine for the children, as favored by *Custody of Kali* and related authorities.

### VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION

35. Mother does not seek to reduce Father’s relationship with the children, but rather seeks a parenting‑time schedule that reflects Father’s current work schedule and capacity, and that ensures the children’s best interests and safety.

36. Mother respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2020 Custody Order so that:

   a. Mother remains the primary physical custodian of the minor children, consistent with the existing arrangement.

   b. Father’s parenting time continues on an every‑other‑weekend basis, but with the following clarification and modification of overnights:

      i. Father shall have overnight parenting time only on nights when he is not scheduled to work an overnight shift (e.g., 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. or similar hours), and when he is reasonably rested and able to provide direct care and supervision.

      ii. On any weekend or weekday when Father is scheduled to work overnight, the children shall return to Mother’s care before Father leaves for work, or shall remain with Mother overnight, unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by the parties.

      iii. The mid‑week overnight shall occur only on a night when Father is not scheduled to work overnight and can be present and awake to care for the children. If Father’s work schedule in a given week does not permit such an overnight, there shall be no mid‑week overnight that week, but the parties may agree to a reasonable alternative visit (such as a dinner or afternoon visit) when Father is off duty.

   c. Father shall not delegate his overnight parenting time to roommates or other third parties as primary overnight caregivers in lieu of his presence, except for short‑term, incidental childcare (e.g., brief errands or emergencies) consistent with the children’s best interests.

   d. Father shall provide Mother with reasonable advance written notice (by text or email) of his work schedule for each upcoming month as soon as it is available, so that the parties may plan overnight parenting time only on nights when Father is not working.

   e. In the event Father becomes unexpectedly scheduled to work an overnight during a time that would otherwise be his overnight parenting time, he shall notify Mother as soon as reasonably possible and the children shall remain in or return to Mother’s care, unless both parties agree in writing to an alternative arrangement that is safe and in the children’s best interests.

   f. The parties shall continue to share information about the children’s health, education, and welfare, and shall cooperate in scheduling non‑conflicting parenting time, consistent with the best interests of the children and the policy of encouraging frequent and continuing contact with both parents, as recognized in G.L. c. 208, § 31.

37. Mother further requests that the Court issue any additional orders reasonably necessary to effectuate the above modifications, to clarify the parties’ responsibilities, and to protect the children’s welfare, including but not limited to:
   a. Clarification of exchange times and locations; and  
   b. Any reasonable conditions on overnight parenting time to ensure that a capable, attentive, and rested adult is providing primary care when the children are with Father overnight.

### VII. NO OTHER MODIFICATIONS SOUGHT

38. This Complaint for Modification is limited to the issues of custody/physical care and parenting‑time scheduling and related conditions, based on the material change in Father’s work schedule and its impact on the children.

39. Mother does not, by this Complaint, seek to modify child support, legal custody, or any other provisions of the 2020 Custody Order, except as may be incidentally required to implement the requested parenting‑time modifications or as the Court otherwise deems just and proper.

### VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

A. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2020 custody and parenting‑time order, specifically due to Father’s new overnight work schedule and its impact on his ability to exercise overnight parenting time and provide appropriate supervision.

B. Find that the requested modifications are in the best interests of the minor children, Liam and Ava Turner, under G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31 and the applicable case law cited herein.

C. Modify the 2020 Custody Order to provide that:
   1. Mother shall continue as the primary physical custodian of the minor children;  
   2. Father’s parenting time shall continue on an every‑other‑weekend basis and one mid‑week period, but overnights shall occur only on nights when Father is not working overnight and is available, awake, and able to supervise the children;  
   3. On nights when Father is scheduled to work overnight, the children shall be in Mother’s care overnight, unless both parties agree in writing to a safe, appropriate alternative;  
   4. Father shall provide Mother with advance notice of his monthly work schedule and promptly notify her of any changes that interfere with scheduled overnights; and  
   5. Father shall not routinely delegate his overnight parenting time to a roommate or other third party as the primary caregiver in his absence.

D. Enter such additional and further orders as this Court deems just, proper, and in the best interests of the minor children.

E. Grant such other relief as this Court considers equitable and appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,  

PLAINTIFF,  
JESSICA TURNER
