**Civil Action No.: [_________]**  
  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a negligence action arising from an incident on August 15, 2023, at a restaurant owned, operated, and controlled by Defendant Quincy Dining LLC, located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169.  

2. Plaintiff Emily Carter sustained significant injuries as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn invitees of a known hazardous condition. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other losses as permitted under Massachusetts law.  

**II. PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant Quincy Dining LLC is a Massachusetts limited liability company having its principal place of business at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts 02169, and was, at all times material to this action, the owner and operator of the restaurant where the incident occurred.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the damages sought do not exceed $50,000.  

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the Defendant conducts business in Norfolk County, and the incident that gave rise to this claim occurred within this jurisdiction.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was an invitee dining at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  

8. During her visit, Plaintiff entered a narrow hallway between the restaurant’s kitchen and dining area, where she observed and attempted to traverse what she believed to be glistening tile.  

9. Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, the floor in the hallway was wet due to water and ice that had been spilled approximately ten minutes earlier when a server dropped a tray of water glasses.  

10. Although the broken glass was cleared by restaurant staff, no effort was made to either clean the water or to warn patrons of the dangerous condition.  

11. No wet floor signs, cones, or other warning devices were placed in the hallway, despite the ongoing hazard.  

12. As Plaintiff walked through the hallway, she slipped on the wet floor, causing her to twist her knee severely.  

13. Plaintiff was immediately in great pain and later sought medical treatment at urgent care, where she was diagnosed with a sprained knee.  

14. Plaintiff’s treatment required her to wear a knee brace and undergo weeks of physical therapy, resulting in significant medical expenses and loss of income.  

15. Plaintiff overheard staff members at the restaurant acknowledging that the wet floor had existed for some time, with one staff member stating they had been “dodging that puddle” prior to Plaintiff’s fall.  

16. Defendant’s employees were aware or should have been aware of the hazardous condition but failed to take reasonable steps to remediate it or adequately warn patrons.  

17. Defendant’s failure to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  

**V. NEGLIGENCE**  

18. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–17 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed a duty of care to all lawful invitees, including Plaintiff, to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any hazardous conditions of which it knew or should have known.  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Allowing water and ice to remain on the floor for an unreasonable period of time;  
   b. Failing to promptly clean the hazardous condition;  
   c. Failing to warn patrons, including Plaintiff, of the wet and slippery floor;  
   d. Failing to institute and enforce reasonable safety policies to prevent such hazardous conditions from harming patrons.  

21. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the hazardous condition because its employees caused the spill and were observed discussing it.  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered significant injuries, including a sprained knee that required medical treatment, caused pain and suffering, and resulted in economic damages, including medical expenses and lost wages.  

23. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable results of Defendant’s negligent conduct.  

**VI. DAMAGES**  

24. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:  
   a. Medical expenses totaling approximately $2,200;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $1,500;  
   c. Physical pain and emotional distress; and  
   d. Other losses to be proven at trial.  

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $10,000, or such other amount as the Court determines proper to fairly and adequately compensate Plaintiff for her injuries and losses;  

2. Costs of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6F;  

3. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6H;  

4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**VIII. JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully submitted,**
