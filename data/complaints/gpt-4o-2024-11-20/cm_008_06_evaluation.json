To the contrary, the findings reflect that the mother is a loving and appropriate caretaker.\u201d"

Education is mentioned only factually (that the child is doing well in school and the father is attentive), and the legal analysis and holding focus on domestic violence and the need for explicit findings about its impact in custody determinations.
