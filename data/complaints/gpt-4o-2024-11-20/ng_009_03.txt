**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**LYNN DISTRICT COURT**

**Jordan Smith,**  
**Plaintiff,**  
v.  
**Lynn Apartment Management, LLC,**  
**Defendant.**  

**CIVIL ACTION NO.: [To be assigned by the court]**  
_______________________________________

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

This is a civil action for negligence under Massachusetts law, arising from the defendant’s failure to maintain required smoke detectors in the common areas of an apartment building, resulting in injuries and damages to the plaintiff. The defendant had a statutory and common-law duty to maintain its premises in a safe condition, including ensuring the operational functionality of smoke detectors, and its failure to do so caused the plaintiff’s injuries and associated damages.

**PARTIES**  

1. The plaintiff, Jordan Smith, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 3, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905, and was a tenant in the defendant’s property at all relevant times.  
2. The defendant, Lynn Apartment Management, LLC, is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its principal office located at [insert the company address, if known]. The defendant owns and manages the residential apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905 (“the Premises”).  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the defendant conducts business in Massachusetts and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lynn, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the Premises where the conduct and injuries occurred is located in Lynn, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is a tenant residing on the third floor of the Premises, which is owned and managed by defendant Lynn Apartment Management, LLC.  
6. Massachusetts law, including M.G.L. c. 148, § 26E, requires landlords of residential apartment buildings to install and maintain operational smoke detectors in common areas, including hallways.  
7. The Massachusetts Building Code (780 CMR § 28) also mandates that smoke alarms must function properly in residential buildings.  
8. For several months leading up to September 15, 2023, the smoke detector in the hallway outside the plaintiff’s third-floor apartment repeatedly emitted warning "chirping" noises, signaling a failing battery.  
9. On multiple occasions, the plaintiff and other tenants notified the defendant of the issue, but the defendant failed to repair or replace the battery in the smoke detector.  
10. At some point, someone removed the battery entirely from the detector to silence the chirping and left the disconnected battery on a windowsill. The defendant took no steps to fix the detector even after being informed of this situation.  
11. On the night of September 15, 2023, at approximately 11:30 PM, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment due to an unattended cooking appliance, causing significant smoke to fill the building.  
12. Because the required hallway smoke detector outside the plaintiff’s unit was nonoperational, the plaintiff did not receive any warning of the fire.  
13. By the time the plaintiff smelled smoke, the hallway was already filled with thick smoke, making evacuation difficult and dangerous.  
14. The plaintiff attempted to exit the building but inhaled large amounts of smoke, experiencing difficulty breathing.  
15. The plaintiff was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where they received treatment for smoke inhalation and were discharged the following day.  
16. As a result of this incident, the plaintiff incurred approximately $12,000 in medical expenses and lost approximately $2,500 in wages due to missed work.  
17. The plaintiff also suffered property damage to personal belongings caused by smoke and water, resulting in further financial loss.  

**COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE**  

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
19. Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, LLC, owed a duty of care under Massachusetts law to keep its property in a reasonably safe condition, including maintaining operational smoke detectors in common areas as required by law. See *Soule v. Massachusetts Elec. Co.*, 378 Mass. 177, 181 (1979) (property owners owe a duty of reasonable care).  
20. Defendant further owed a statutory duty under M.G.L. c. 148, § 26E, to ensure that smoke detectors were properly installed and operational in common areas of the Premises. See also *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783-84 (2007) (statutory duties inform scope of negligence).  
21. Defendant breached its duty to the plaintiff by failing to repair or replace the battery in the nonfunctional smoke detector outside the plaintiff’s third-floor apartment, despite multiple notifications from tenants about the issue.  
22. Defendant's failure to repair the smoke detector constitutes a violation of its statutory and common-law duties and exemplifies a lack of reasonable care. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 373 (2010) (negligence established by failure to take reasonable steps to correct known hazards).  
23. As a direct and proximate result of the defendant’s negligent conduct, the plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation injuries, requiring medical treatment, time away from work, and significant emotional and financial harm. See *Irwin v. Town of Ware*, 392 Mass. 745, 764 (1984) (proximate cause established if harm is foreseeable).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, plaintiff Jordan Smith respectfully requests that the Court grant the following relief:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff on all counts of this Complaint;  
2. Award damages to the plaintiff in an amount sufficient to compensate for:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately $12,000;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $2,500;
