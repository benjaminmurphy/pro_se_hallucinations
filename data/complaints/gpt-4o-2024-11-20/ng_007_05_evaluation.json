Therefore, it cannot be cited as authority for a duty of reasonable supervision for children in a custodial setting.",

The borrower, C & W, alleged that Alliance, the lender, misrepresented the rate to be charged on the loan, miscalculated the amount of interest necessary to be paid upon prepayment, and inflated the amount necessary for prepayment by including an improper charge, and refused to pay to C & W the funds generated by the charge."

Pine Manor College and focuses entirely on proximate cause, not on whether the defendant owed a duty of reasonable supervision to protect persons in its care. The majority opinion in Mullins does recognize such a duty by a college to its students, but the quoted dissent neither discusses children nor establishes the duty proposition claimed. Using this specific text to support a duty-of-care proposition is therefore inaccurate.",

The holding is that the Authority should have foreseen unauthorized, dangerous operation of an unsecured forklift, making it negligent, but it does not discuss supervision ratios or ignored complaints. Thus it does not support the specific proposition about inadequate child supervision and ignored roughhousing complaints.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cUnder the facts of this case the jury would have been warranted in concluding that the actions of the seaman were foreseeable\u2026 It was thus reasonably foreseeable that the forklift, when left unsecured with the keys in the ignition on premises which were solely under the authority\u2019s control, would be operated by unauthorized persons, including inebriated seamen who the authority knew had unfettered access to the cargo area. It was also reasonably foreseeable\u2026 that unauthorized operation would likely cause harm to persons known to pass through the area\u2026\u201d"

It does not address or recognize damages such as medical expenses, lost wages, or pain and suffering as a result of proven negligence; rather, it finds no actionable negligence by the defendant at all. Therefore, it does not support the proposition that, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant\u2019s negligence, Plaintiff incurred the specified economic and non-economic losses.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"We reject the argument that a parent, who neither provides alcoholic beverages nor makes them available, owes a duty to travelers on the highways to supervise a party given by her minor child. We reach this conclusion even if [the defendant] knew or reasonably should have known that alcoholic beverages would be available. The defendant\u2019s conduct did not create a risk of injury to the plaintiff for which we are prepared to say the common law should provide a remedy.\""
