Ellard is indeed the Massachusetts case that abolished the common-law distinction between invitees and licensees and recognized a general duty of reasonable care owed by property occupiers to lawful visitors, which includes landlords vis-\u00e0-vis tenants and their lawful guests. The excerpt provided is a concurrence focused on the treatment of trespassers, but the majority opinion in Mounsey sets out the broader premises-liability duty that the proposition invokes. Because the quoted text is narrow and does not itself restate the landlord-tenant duty, the support is inferred from the known holding rather than from this passage alone.",

It does so in reliance on and as a development of Mounsey\u2019s general duty-of-care framework, and it squarely holds that a landlord can be liable in negligence for failing to repair a known dangerous condition (the porch railing) even though it was part of the demised premises rather than a common area. Thus, it directly supports the stated proposition about a landlord\u2019s duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law.",

A landlord must act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances\u2026 Henceforth, this basic principle of responsibility applies to Massachusetts landlords as well.\u201d"
