**COMPLAINT**  
Michael Johnson (“Plaintiff”), individually and as the parent and next friend of A.J., his minor son, by and through himself, states the following as his Complaint against Defendant Brockton Community Center (“Defendant”), and alleges as follows:

---

### **INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is an action for negligence arising out of an incident in which the Defendant failed to provide proper supervision at its after-school program, resulting in Plaintiff's son, A.J., suffering a concussion and related injuries while attending the program.

---

### **PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Michael Johnson is an individual residing in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. He is the father of A.J., a minor child who suffered injuries as a direct result of the Defendant’s negligence.

3. Defendant Brockton Community Center is a community organization operating in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with its principal place of business located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301.

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. Jurisdiction is proper as the events giving rise to this action occurred in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, specifically at the Defendant's facility in Brockton, Plymouth County.

5. Venue is proper in the Brockton District Court under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223, Sections 1 and 8, as the alleged negligence and resulting injuries occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business in this jurisdiction.

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Defendant operates an after-school program at its facility located at 45 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA 02301. Defendant advertises that children attending the program will be properly and consistently supervised while participating in activities, including those in its gymnasium.

7. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff's son, A.J., an eight-year-old minor, was attending the Defendant's after-school program in the gymnasium.

8. At the time of the incident, there were approximately 20 children on the gymnasium floor. Defendant was required to have two employees supervising the children, but one employee left the gymnasium to complete administrative tasks in the office.

9. The sole remaining staff member in the gymnasium was distracted and inattentive, spending significant time looking at her phone instead of monitoring the children. Despite being informed by other children that rough play was escalating, this staff member failed to intervene and allegedly responded, "boys will be boys."

10. Two larger children, estimated to be around 12 years old, began playing a rough, unsanctioned tackle game on the hardwood floor, eventually colliding with Plaintiff’s son, A.J., who was much younger and smaller in stature.

11. A.J. was tackled to the floor, striking his head on the hardwood surface. He lost consciousness for approximately 30 seconds and required immediate emergency medical care.

12. A.J. was taken to the emergency room and diagnosed with a concussion. He was required to miss several days of school and continues to suffer from lingering effects. Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,500 in medical expenses for A.J.'s treatment and an additional $1,200 in lost wages due to work absences necessitated by the incident.

---

### **CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.

14. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff’s minor son, A.J., to provide a safe environment, reasonable supervision, and protection from foreseeable harm during activities conducted at its facility. *Leibovich v. Antonellis*, 410 Mass. 568, 574 (1991).

15. Defendant breached this duty by failing to adequately supervise the children in the gymnasium and allowing one of two required staff members to leave the gym, leaving the remaining staff member to perform her duties inattentively and negligently.

16. Defendant further breached its duty when its staff member disregarded reports of rough play and failed to intervene to prevent foreseeable harm to A.J., in direct violation of *Akins v. Gillette Stadium Corp.*, 92 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 695 (2018).

17. The Defendant’s failure to adequately train its employees to ensure vigilant supervision and immediate intervention in potentially harmful situations constitutes gross negligence and is supported by *Vasquez v. Greenfield Pub. Sch.*, 484 Mass. 357, 367-369 (2020).

18. Defendant's breach of duty was the proximate cause of the harm suffered by A.J., as Defendant could have taken steps to prevent the escalating rough play that led to the incident. *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196, 198 (1994).

19. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff individually and on behalf of A.J. suffered damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, emotional and physical pain, lost wages, and loss of enjoyment of A.J.'s normal childhood activities. *Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.*, 386 Mass. 291, 295 (1982).

20. Massachusetts law recognizes that individuals and entities responsible for child care programs owe a heightened duty to ensure the safety of minors due to their vulnerable status. *Reinert v. New England Novelty Co.*, 428 Mass. 261, 263 (1998).

---

### **DAMAGES**  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence:  
   a. Plaintiff incurred $5,500 in medical expenses.  
   b. Plaintiff lost $1,200 in wages due to work absences.  
   c. Plaintiff and A.J. suffered emotional distress, pain, and suffering.  

---

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Michael Johnson, individually and as parent and next friend of A.J., respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Brockton Community Center for the following relief:  
1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $6,700, plus any additional medical or other expenses incurred.  
2. Prejudgment interest pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 231, Section 6B.  
3. Costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to Massachusetts law.  
4. Such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

---

### **JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.
