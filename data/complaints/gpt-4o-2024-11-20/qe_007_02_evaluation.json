It holds that such interference with quiet enjoyment\u2014here, repeated unsanitary flooding\u2014falls within \u00a7 14 and makes the landlord liable, thereby recognizing that serious interference with a tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the premises violates c. 186, \u00a7 14.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 belongs to a body of statutes establishing tenants\u2019 remedies against landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing\u2026 The common law background of \u00a7 14 also suggests that malicious intent is not a condition of liability. The phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 \u2026 The jury found in answer to a special question\u2026 that the water interfered with Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment of her apartment. Therefore, Gem is liable under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u201d"

It does not discuss construction activity, disruption from construction, or a landlord\u2019s duty to mitigate such disruption. Therefore, it provides no authority for the proposition that failure to mitigate construction-related disruption is a clear breach of the statutory covenant.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

There is no mention of a landlord offering a small rent reduction or the court declaring such a remedy inadequate. Thus, while the case supports that substantial interference is actionable and can justify more than nominal relief, it does not specifically stand for the proposition that a $100 rent reduction (or any nominal sum) is an inadequate remedy.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIf the defendant has failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u2026 If the defendant has taken no action or inadequate action, despite covenanting that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to quiet enjoyment shall not be interfered with, then the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment, appropriate injunctive relief, costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d"
