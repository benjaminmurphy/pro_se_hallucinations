            COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Plaintiff Jessica Moore (“Plaintiff”), by and for her Complaint against Defendant Linda Johnson (“Defendant”), alleges as follows:

                                       INTRODUCTION

1. This is an action for damages arising out of Defendant’s failure to remedy significant water intrusion problems in Plaintiff’s rental unit, in violation of Plaintiff’s rights under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, including the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14. Despite being informed of the issues and their consequences, Defendant failed to take appropriate action, causing Plaintiff substantial harm.

                                    JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2. This Court has jurisdiction under G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides for statutory remedies for violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

3. Venue is proper in this Court because the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Roxbury, Massachusetts, which is part of the Court’s jurisdiction.

                                            PARTIES

4. Plaintiff Jessica Moore is a Massachusetts resident who resides at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the “Premises”). Plaintiff has rented the Premises from Defendant since March 1, 2022.

5. Defendant Linda Johnson is the landlord and owner of the Premises. Upon information and belief, Defendant resides in Massachusetts and is responsible for maintaining the Premises at 123 Maple Street.

                                   FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6. Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant on March 1, 2022, for the Premises at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA 02119. Plaintiff has paid $1,200 per month in rent as required under the lease.

7. In October 2025, Plaintiff fell behind on rent by two weeks due to unforeseen medical bills but subsequently paid all rent owed, including applicable late fees.

8. In November 2025, Plaintiff discovered water seeping through the basement wall of the Premises during rainstorms, resulting in moisture accumulation in the living space. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant via text message.

9. Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s notification by stating that she would “look into it,” but Defendant failed to take any steps to address the water intrusion over the following weeks.

10. On or about November 29, 2025, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department. Upon inspection, the City identified water intrusion problems as well as other housing code violations at the Premises.

11. The water intrusion caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including ruining a rug and a wooden bookshelf, with damages totaling approximately $400. Plaintiff has also had to run a dehumidifier constantly to manage moisture, leading to increased electricity costs.

12. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated attempts to obtain remediation of these issues, Defendant has failed to make necessary repairs, leaving the water intrusion problem unresolved.

13. In response to Plaintiff’s efforts to enforce her rights as a tenant, including her involvement of the City inspectors, Defendant has retaliated by indicating that she will not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it ends in March 2026. Defendant has asserted that her decision not to renew is based on Plaintiff’s late rent in October, but this justification is pretextual and retaliatory under all the circumstances.

14. Defendant’s actions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises, causing Plaintiff harm in the form of property damage, increased utility expenses, and emotional distress.

                               COUNT I: VIOLATION OF G.L. c. 186, § 14
                          (Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

15. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs 1 through 14.

16. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, tenants in Massachusetts are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment of their rental premises, which prohibits landlords from engaging in or allowing actions that interfere with a tenant’s ability to use and enjoy their rental property.

17. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to address the significant water intrusion problems at the Premises despite Plaintiff’s repeated notice of the issue, causing ongoing physical and financial harm to Plaintiff.

18. Defendant further breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by retaliating against Plaintiff for exercising her legal rights, including contacting City inspectors, by threatening not to renew Plaintiff’s lease.

19. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, landlords are liable for damages of up to three months’ rent or actual damages, whichever is greater, along with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

20. As a result of Defendant’s violations, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including but not limited to $400 in property losses, increased electricity costs, and emotional distress.

                                        PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Moore respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Linda Johnson as follows:

A. Award Plaintiff actual damages caused by Defendant’s violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to $400 in property damage and compensation for increased utility costs and emotional distress;

B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages of up to three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;

C. Award Plaintiff her costs incurred in this action;

D. Award reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by law; and

E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

Dated: December 1, 2025                          Respectfully submitted,  

                                                 _____________________________
