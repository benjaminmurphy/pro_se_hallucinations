It does not interpret Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, or discuss an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential leases. The case is about due process and equal protection in summary eviction, not about state-law implied covenants protecting tenants from landlord interference, so it does not support the specific Massachusetts landlord-tenant proposition cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The Constitution has not federalized the substantive law of landlord-tenant relations, however, and we see nothing to forbid Oregon from treating the undertakings of the tenant and those of the landlord as independent rather than dependent covenants. ... The substantive law of landlord-tenant relations differs widely in the various States. In some jurisdictions, a tenant may argue as a defense to eviction for nonpayment of rent such claims as unrepaired building code violations, breach of an implied warranty of habitability, or the fact that the landlord is evicting him for reporting building code violations or for exercising constitutional rights.\""

The court cites prior cases, including ones involving leaks and habitability defects, as examples of substantial interferences.

On the rent control issue, the court explicitly upholds the trial judge\u2019s finding that the landlord\u2019s violation was *not* willful. On the security deposit and other statutory claims, the opinion focuses on strict statutory consequences (treble damages after demand and failure to return) rather than on a factual finding that the landlord acted with willful or knowing disregard of the tenant\u2019s rights after repeated notice.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe judge\u2019s finding that Young\u2019s violation was not wilful is not clearly erroneous, as Young could easily have had the property decontrolled much earlier. The tenant is, however, entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the ordinance, as \u00a7 9 expressly provides for liability for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs for any person who \u2018receives, or retains any payment of rent, in excess of the maximum lawful rent.\u2019 A showing that a violation is neither wilful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions merely limits the amount of liquidated damages to the amount of the overcharge.\u201d"

The judge ruled further that the tenant is allowed to abate the rent from the date the landlord had notice of the breach of the warranty of habitability.
