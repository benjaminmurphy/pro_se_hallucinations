**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**BRISTOL DIVISION**  

**DOCKET NO. ________**

**Jessica Collins**,  
Plaintiff,  
  
v.  

**Michael Smith**,  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, in the above-captioned matter, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting schedule established on June 15, 2020, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

### **I. PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Collins**, is the mother and primary custodial parent of the two minor children: **Ethan**, age 8, and **Emma**, age 6. Jessica resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her contact information is as follows: Phone: (617) 555-0123; Email: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. The Defendant, **Michael Smith**, is the father of Ethan and Emma. Michael resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

3. This Court has proper jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter under G.L. c. 208, § 28A, as both parties and the minor children reside in Massachusetts.  

---

### **II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND**  

4. On **June 15, 2020**, this Honorable Court issued a custody and parenting order granting the Plaintiff and Defendant **joint legal custody**, with the Plaintiff being the **primary custodial parent**.  

5. Under the current order, the Defendant was granted parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week. This arrangement was appropriate at the time of the order because both parties worked regular daytime hours and were able to co-parent effectively given those circumstances.  

---

### **III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

6. Since the entry of the existing order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that significantly impacts the children’s well-being and the practicality of the parenting schedule.  

7. In particular, the Defendant recently took a new job that requires him to work overnight shifts, specifically from **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM**, several nights per week, including on many occasions when he is scheduled to have parenting time with the children.  

8. Due to his new work schedule, the Defendant frequently **fails to exercise his scheduled parenting time**. When the Defendant is unable to take the children, he either:  
   a. **Drops them off at the Plaintiff’s residence** on short notice, often citing exhaustion from overnight work; or  
   b. Leaves them in the custody of his roommate, a third party who is neither well-known to the Plaintiff nor approved by this Court to act as a caregiver.  

9. On several occasions, Ethan and Emma have reported to the Plaintiff that they are left unsupervised or fall asleep on the couch while waiting for the Defendant, who is frequently napping following his overnight shifts.  

10. The Court has held that in custody cases, the **best interests of the children** must be the paramount consideration. See **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488, 495 (2012); **Custody of a Minor**, 389 Mass. 755, 766-67 (1983).  

11. Here, the Defendant’s sporadic and unreliable supervision of the children, coupled with his reliance on third parties for parenting responsibilities, constitutes a **material and substantial change in circumstances** that necessitates modification of the current custody and parenting time order.  

12. The Plaintiff is concerned for the children’s emotional and physical well-being, as well as their need for stability and routine. See **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 244 (2015) (noting that stability and routine are critical aspects of children’s best interests).  

---

### **IV. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**  

13. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the current custody and parenting order be modified to reflect the following changes:  
   a. The Defendant’s parenting time shall be limited to occasions when he is not working overnight shifts and can provide direct supervision and care.  
   b. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with at least **48 hours’ notice** of any anticipated childcare conflicts requiring the children to stay with the Plaintiff during his scheduled parenting time.  
   c. Any substitute caregiver used by the Defendant must be identified and approved in advance by the Plaintiff and/or the Court, consistent with the principles articulated in **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262 (2001).  

14. These proposed modifications are in the best interests of the children and are necessary to ensure their safety, stability, and emotional development. See **Guardianship of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590, 599-600 (1996) (emphasizing the importance of assessing the totality of circumstances in ensuring the welfare of children).  

15. The requested modification aligns with the principles outlined in **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which allows the Court to modify custody orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the children’s best interests.  

---

### **V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances related to the Defendant’s ability to exercise parenting time in accordance with the existing custody order.  
2. Modify the custody and parenting order to reflect the proposed changes outlined in Section IV of this Complaint.  
3. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
