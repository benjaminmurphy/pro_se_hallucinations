While much of the discussion is couched in terms of parental unfitness in care-and-protection and related proceedings, the court repeatedly links fitness to the child\u2019s best interests, making clear that the child\u2019s welfare/best interests are paramount in custody determinations. Thus, it provides support for the proposition that the best interests of the children must be the paramount consideration.",

Custody is not to be transferred from the natural parent simply because another prospective custodian is thought to be better qualified. \u2026 \u2018State intervention in the parent-child relationship is justified only when parents appear unable to provide for their children\u2019s care and protection.\u2019 \u2026 In that sense, the fitness of parents and the best interests of the child are related. \u2026 \u2018[T]he critical question is whether the natural parents are currently fit to further the welfare and best interests of the child.\u2019\u201d"

It does not address, establish, or even mention any rule requiring that substitute caregivers be identified and approved in advance by the other parent or the court. The discussion of third-party childcare is purely factual background and is not converted into a legal standard or condition on custody or visitation, so the case does not support the cited proposition.",

Other than in Caleb\u2019s first year, when childcare was provided by the father\u2019s sister, childcare was provided primarily by the maternal grandmother, in addition to other family members and nonfamily caregivers.\u201d"
