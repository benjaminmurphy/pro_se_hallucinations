**Civil Action No. TBD**

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a personal injury action arising out of the negligence of Defendant, Discount Home Goods, Inc., in maintaining its store premises in a reasonably safe condition. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff, Ryan Thompson, was struck by a falling box while shopping in Defendant’s store, causing physical injuries, economic losses, and emotional distress.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Ryan Thompson is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
3. Defendant Discount Home Goods, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Massachusetts, with its principal place of business located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the Defendant conducts business in Middlesex County and the incident occurred at Defendant’s store located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

**FACTS**  
6. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff Ryan Thompson was a lawful customer at Defendant’s home-goods retail store located at 214 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  
7. Defendant is engaged in the business of selling home goods, including kitchen appliances, and invites members of the public such as Plaintiff to shop at its store.  
8. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as an invitee, to exercise reasonable care in the management and maintenance of its store premises, including ensuring that merchandise was displayed and stored in a reasonably safe manner.  
9. Defendant stacked heavy boxes of kitchen appliances, including toaster ovens, on high shelves in its store without implementing safety precautions such as straps, barriers, or other means to prevent the boxes from falling.  
10. At or about 3:00 PM on September 15, 2023, a fellow customer inadvertently bumped the shelving while moving down the aisle with a shopping cart, which caused a box of a toaster oven to fall from the top shelf.  
11. The falling box struck Plaintiff on the left shoulder and the side of his head.  
12. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff began feeling dizzy and developed a severe headache. Plaintiff reported the incident to the store manager, who completed an incident report but offered no meaningful assistance beyond providing a store coupon.  
13. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened, prompting him to seek treatment at a local emergency room. Doctors diagnosed Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.  
14. Plaintiff incurred $1,500 in medical expenses for the diagnosis and treatment of his injuries.  
15. Plaintiff, a delivery driver, was unable to work for three days due to his injuries, causing him to lose approximately $800 in wages.  
16. Plaintiff also suffered emotional distress, physical pain, and inconvenience and was unable to participate in his weekly soccer league for approximately one month.  

**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**  
17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each of the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance, operation, and inspection of its store premises. (See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 931 N.E.2d 142 (2010)).  
19. Defendant breached its duty of care by negligently stacking heavy boxes on high shelves without securing them with safety mechanisms such as straps, barriers, or similar devices.  
20. Defendant knew or should have known that heavy items stacked improperly and without safety precautions created a foreseeable risk of harm to customers. (*Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 863 N.E.2d 1276 (2007)).  
21. Defendant failed to implement reasonable measures to mitigate this risk, such as inspecting the shelves, securing merchandise, or adequately training employees to properly stack goods.  
22. Defendant’s negligence was a direct and proximate cause of the injuries Plaintiff sustained when the box fell and struck him.  
23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and endured emotional distress.  

**DAMAGES**  
24. Plaintiff suffered economic damages, including but not limited to $1,500 in medical expenses and $800 in lost wages.  
25. Plaintiff suffered non-economic damages, including but not limited to pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

C. Costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as permitted under applicable law; and  
D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
