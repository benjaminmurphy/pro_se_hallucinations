The court discusses the statutory and common\u2011law covenant of quiet enjoyment, interprets G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 broadly to protect tenants, and holds that repeated flooding and unsanitary conditions that impaired the tenant\u2019s use constituted interference with quiet enjoyment and a breach of the landlord\u2019s duty, subjecting the landlord to damages and attorney\u2019s fees. This aligns with the proposition that Massachusetts courts uphold tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment rights and hold landlords liable where conditions substantially impair use and enjoyment.",
