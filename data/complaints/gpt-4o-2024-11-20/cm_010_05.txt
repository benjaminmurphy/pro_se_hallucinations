*Plaintiff*,  
v.  
**MICHAEL HARRINGTON**  
*Defendant*.

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order regarding the minor child, Sophie Harrington. In support of this Complaint for Modification, the Plaintiff states the following:  

---

### **1. PARTIES**  
**Plaintiff:** Jessica Harrington resides at [Insert Current Address] and is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Harrington.  

**Defendant:** Michael Harrington resides at [Insert Current Address] and is the father of the minor child, Sophie Harrington.  

**Minor Child:**  
- Sophie Harrington, age 10 (Date of Birth: [Insert DOB]).  

---

### **2. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
This Court has proper jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the Bristol County Probate and Family Court issued the original custody order on or about April 15, 2018, and the minor child resides within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Venue is proper in Bristol County as it is the county where both parties reside.  

---

### **3. CURRENT CUSTODY ORDER**  
On April 15, 2018, this Court entered a custody order awarding Michael Harrington primary physical custody of the minor child and granting Jessica Harrington parenting time in the form of:  
- Weekends on an every-other-week basis,  
- One midweek dinner per week, and  
- Such additional time as the parties may agree.  

---

### **4. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  
Since the entry of the April 15, 2018 custody order, significant and material changes in circumstances have occurred, warranting a modification of custody and parenting time in the best interests of the child. The specific facts supporting this request include:  

#### **a. Plaintiff's Improved Living and Employment Stability**  
- In 2018, Plaintiff was enrolled in graduate school, living in a one-bedroom, studio apartment and working part-time. At that time, Plaintiff had limited flexibility in her schedule and could not provide the minor child with consistent overnight care.  
- Plaintiff has since completed graduate school and obtained stable, full-time employment with regular and predictable hours.  
- Plaintiff now resides in a two-bedroom apartment, and the minor child has her own bedroom. Plaintiff's current living environment is significantly more stable and conducive to extended parenting time, including overnights.  

#### **b. The Minor Child's Expressed Preference for Increased Time with Plaintiff**  
- The minor child, Sophie Harrington, has developed a close and loving bond with the Plaintiff, her mother.  
- Sophie's therapist has indicated that Sophie feels guilty about the limited time she has with her mother and has expressed a desire for additional time with Plaintiff, including overnight visits.  
- Sophie has written a letter addressed to this Honorable Court expressing her desire for more equitable parenting time.  

#### **c. Defendant's Lack of Cooperation and Hostility Toward Modification**  
- Plaintiff has attempted to engage Defendant in discussions regarding an increase in the Plaintiff’s parenting time, as recommended by Sophie’s therapist, but Defendant has refused to engage in meaningful communication and has reacted with hostility when approached on the subject.  

---

### **5. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**  
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the 2018 custody and parenting time order to provide for a parenting schedule that reflects the best interests of the minor child, Sophie Harrington. Specifically, Plaintiff requests the following modifications:  
1. A parenting schedule that provides for shared physical custody and significantly increased parenting time for Plaintiff, including but not limited to alternating weekends and multiple weeknight overnights each week.  
2. Any other parenting schedule or arrangement this Honorable Court deems just and proper to serve the best interests of the minor child.  

---

### **6. LEGAL SUPPORT**  
Pursuant to Massachusetts law, modifications of child custody and parenting time orders may be granted upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where the modification serves the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

In evaluating the best interests of the child, Massachusetts courts consider several factors, including the child’s emotional needs, relationships with the parents, and the ability of each parent to provide a stable and nurturing environment. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

Plaintiff asserts that her improved living conditions and employment stability constitute a significant material change in circumstances. Moreover, the minor child's desire for greater time with her mother further supports that a modification would be in Sophie's best interests. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).  

Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant's unwillingness to cooperate in considering Sophie’s expressed wishes and therapeutic input is contrary to Sophie’s emotional well-being. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981). Recalibrating the parenting schedule to align with Sophie’s expressed needs and preferences would further serve her best interests.   

Additionally, Massachusetts courts emphasize the importance of a child's relationship with both parents. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003). Increasing Plaintiff’s parenting time would more adequately support this principle.  

Other case law and authority supporting a modification in this scenario include:  
- *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).  
- *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
- *Chasnov v. Chasnov*, 370 Mass. 499 (1976).  
- *McMahon v. McMahon*, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 504 (1991).

### **7. RELIEF REQUESTED**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the April 15, 2018 custody and parenting time order to allow for an expanded parenting schedule that ensures Sophie Harrington’s best interests, including shared physical custody or an equitable parenting time arrangement.  
2. Order such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
