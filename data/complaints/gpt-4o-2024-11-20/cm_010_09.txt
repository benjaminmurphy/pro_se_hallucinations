**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, hereby complains as follows:**

---

### **INTRODUCTION**
1. This is a Complaint for Modification of a custody order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and other applicable Massachusetts law.  
2. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody and parenting plan established in the Judgment of Divorce Nisi issued by this Court on or about **May 15, 2016**, on the grounds that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that makes the current order no longer in the best interest of the minor child, **Sophie Johnson** (age 10).

### **PARTIES**
3. Plaintiff, **Jessica Thompson**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child.  
4. Defendant, **Michael Johnson**, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**
5. On **May 15, 2016**, this Court issued a custody judgment granting primary physical custody of Sophie Johnson to Defendant, with Plaintiff receiving parenting time limited to weekends and one weeknight dinner.  
6. The original custody arrangement reflected Plaintiff's circumstances at the time: as a graduate student with a demanding schedule, limited financial resources, and housing conditions unsuitable for joint custody.  
7. Since the entry of the custody judgment, Plaintiff's circumstances have materially changed in a manner that warrants a modification:  
   a. Plaintiff has completed her graduate degree.  
   b. Plaintiff is now employed in a stable, full-time position with regular hours that allow her to care for Sophie.  
   c. Plaintiff resides in a two-bedroom apartment in Middlesex County, where Sophie has her own bedroom and adequate space to engage in daily activities.  
8. Sophie is now 10 years old. As a growing child, her emotional, psychological, and developmental needs have evolved, requiring a greater presence from both parents.  
9. Plaintiff and Sophie have developed a close relationship over the past several years. Sophie's therapist has reported that Sophie experiences guilt and sadness due to the brief length of her visits with Plaintiff and has expressed a desire to spend more time at Plaintiff's home.  
10. Sophie has written a letter to this Court (attached as Exhibit A) expressing her wish for increased overnights with Plaintiff.  
11. Defendant has consistently refused to engage in discussions regarding potential changes to the parenting schedule and has reacted angrily when Sophie raises the issue, resulting in tension and stress for Sophie.
12. The requested modification furthers the best interest of Sophie by providing her with increased parental input and care from Plaintiff, while maintaining a meaningful relationship with both parents.

### **LEGAL STANDARD**
13. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, any order relative to custody may be modified if there has been a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties or the child, and the modification serves the best interest of the child.  
14. Massachusetts courts repeatedly emphasize that custody orders must focus on the **best interest of the child**, considering factors such as parental stability, the child's emotional and developmental needs, and each parent's ability to meet those needs. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
15. Courts also consider the preference of a mature child where appropriate. See **Doe v. Doe**, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 499 (1983) (noting child’s stated preferences may factor into best interest analysis).  
16. A material change in financial, housing, and personal stability of parents is sufficient to meet the standard for modification. See **Pierce v. Pierce**, 455 Mass. 286 (2009).  
17. In this case, Plaintiff has demonstrated substantial improvement in her stability, living conditions, and availability to care for Sophie, satisfying the requirements set forth in **Schaffer v. Schaffer**, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 746 (1997), and other relevant authorities.  
18. A parenting plan that denies sufficient time with one parent without justification is contrary to the principle of maximizing a child’s access to both parents. See **Brooks v. Piela**, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 731 (2004).

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**
19. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court modify the judgment entered on May 15, 2016, to establish a parenting plan that includes:  
   a. Shared physical custody, allocating equal or near-equal parenting time to both parents;  
   b. Increased overnights with Plaintiff, as appropriate to Sophie's needs and expressed wishes;  
   c. Any other orders this Court deems necessary to serve Sophie's best interest.  

---

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Find there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order;  
2. Find that modification of the current custody and parenting plan is in the best interest of the minor child, Sophie Johnson;  
3. Grant Plaintiff's proposed modification to increase parenting time and reflect the parties' current circumstances;  
4. Enter such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
