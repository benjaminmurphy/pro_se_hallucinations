The opinion explains that if the landlord \u201cfailed to take any action or inadequate action\u201d to remove persons engaged in unlawful activity, thereby permitting a condition that substantially interfered with the tenancies, the covenant is breached. This fits within \u201cconditions materially affecting habitability\u201d and thus supports the proposition that such failures can amount to a breach of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.",

L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u201d"

The court explains that \u00a7 14 and the covenant of quiet enjoyment protect tenants from serious interferences with their tenancy, and holds Gem liable under \u00a7 14 precisely because it violated its duty to maintain sanitary, watertight conditions, allowing repeated flooding that interfered with Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment.

It concerns snow and ice on exterior stairs, and the quiet enjoyment discussion is limited to stating that negligence is a prerequisite for recovery under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Nothing in the case holds or suggests that an ongoing rodent infestation constitutes a material breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, so it cannot be cited for that proposition.",

L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Negligence is a prerequisite for recovery under both theories. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997) (showing of negligence is required for recovery under quiet enjoyment statute)\u2026 The jury\u2019s determination that the defendant was not negligent precludes the possibility that the directed verdicts on these claims constitute a basis for a new trial."

Therefore it cannot be cited as authority that ongoing rodent infestation is a material breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
