v.  

**John Smith,**  
**Defendant.**  

**Civil Action No. ________**

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a negligence action brought by the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, against the Defendant, John Smith, for personal injuries sustained when a hazardous tree branch on Defendant's property fell and struck Plaintiff, causing physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
3. Defendant, John Smith, is an individual residing and owning property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 01201.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as this matter involves a civil claim and the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, where Defendant resides and where Plaintiff sustained her injuries.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.  
7. Defendant John Smith is the owner of property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
8. A large maple tree is situated on Defendant's property in close proximity to the public sidewalk.  
9. For at least several months prior to August 15, 2023, a substantial branch of the maple tree overhanging the sidewalk was visibly cracked and sagging.  
10. Neighbors of Defendant observed the condition of the branch and informed Defendant of its hazardous state, suggesting that he hire an arborist to evaluate and address the issue.  
11. Defendant, however, failed to act promptly, responding to the neighbors' concerns by saying that he would "deal with it in the spring," but he failed to follow through.  
12. On August 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was walking along the sidewalk at 123 Maple Street, during a routine summer thunderstorm, the cracked branch finally broke and fell.  
13. The branch struck Plaintiff on the shoulder and back with significant force, knocking her to the ground.  
14. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain and multiple bruises, requiring medical treatment and causing her to miss approximately one week of work.  
15. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses amounting to $1,200 and lost wages totaling $600.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each preceding allegation as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, homeowners owe a duty of reasonable care to individuals lawfully using public sidewalks adjacent to their property to ensure that any hazardous conditions on their property, which could foreseeably injure pedestrians, are appropriately addressed. *See Gage v. City of Westfield*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 682 (1988).  
18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to inspect, maintain, and remedy the hazardous condition of the cracked and sagging tree branch.  
19. Defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition posed by the cracked tree branch because it was clearly visible and Defendant was specifically informed of its condition by neighbors. *See Robichaud v. Healey*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (1987).  
20. Defendant's failure to act was unreasonable under the circumstances and created a foreseeable risk of harm to individuals, including Plaintiff, using the public sidewalk. *See Bernier v. Boston Edison Co.*, 380 Mass. 372, 378 (1980).  
21. Plaintiff was lawfully walking on the sidewalk at the time of the incident and exercised reasonable care for her own safety.  
22. Defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and suffering. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 372 (2010); *R.L. Whipple Co. v. Pondview Excavation Corp.*, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 871, 873 (2008).  

**DAMAGES**  
23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer the following damages:  
    a. Medical expenses in the amount of $1,200, with potential for additional costs;  
    b. Lost wages totaling $600 due to missed work;  
    c. Physical pain and suffering;  
    d. Emotional distress; and  
    e. Other damages to be proven at trial.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award her the following relief:  
1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:  
    a. Medical expenses;  
    b. Lost wages;  
    c. Pain and suffering;  
2. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest;  
3. Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, to the extent allowable by law;  
4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,
