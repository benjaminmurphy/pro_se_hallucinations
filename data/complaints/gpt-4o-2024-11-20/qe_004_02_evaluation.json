The opinion does not mention rodents or pest infestations, nor does it address whether such conditions constitute substantial interference with quiet enjoyment. Thus, using this case specifically for the proposition about persistent rodent infestation is not accurate, though it is suitable authority for the broader substantial-interference concept.",

The court affirms the availability of attorneys\u2019 fees and explains that \u201cactual and consequential damages\u201d under \u00a7 14 include personal injuries such as emotional distress, thereby supporting the use of \u00a7 14 for statutory damages and fees where the landlord\u2019s violation is willful, intentional, or reckless.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAny person who commits any act in violation of this section shall also be liable for actual and consequential damages or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2026\n\u2026we hold that a tenant need not seek a criminal conviction before claiming damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Nor must the tenant prove that the landlord intended to interfere with the tenant\u2019s rights, at least as long as the landlord\u2019s conduct was reckless\u2026 Therefore, Solomon\u2019s claim for emotional distress was within the scope of \u00a7 14, and was properly considered in the determination of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d"
