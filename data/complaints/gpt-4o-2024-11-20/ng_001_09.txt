**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On September 16, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully shopping in the Defendant’s grocery store located at 300 Washington Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  
6. While shopping in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a large puddle of spilled milk and fell to the ground, landing on her side and sustaining serious injuries, including a hip sprain.  
7. The puddle was visibly extensive, as evidenced by multiple grocery cart tracks passing through it.  
8. There were no warning signs, cones, or other safety measures in place near the spill to alert customers to the dangerous condition.  
9. An employee of the Defendant was nearby, approximately fifteen feet from the spill, yet failed to take reasonable steps to address or remedy the hazard.  
10. Upon witnessing the fall, the employee admitted to the Plaintiff that he had been aware of the spill for "a few minutes" but had not yet cleaned it up or placed any warnings because he was "finishing up" a separate task.  
11. Plaintiff completed her shopping but experienced increasing pain in her hip as the day progressed.  
12. On September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical attention at an urgent care facility and was diagnosed with a hip sprain.  
13. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff engaged in multiple physical therapy sessions, accrued approximately $2,500 in medical expenses, and missed several shifts at her job, resulting in a loss of approximately $1,200 in wages.  
14. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about the dangerous condition of the dairy aisle, yet failed to take timely and reasonable steps to eliminate the hazard or warn customers of its existence.  
15. Defendant’s negligence caused Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and monetary losses.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

16. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owes a duty of reasonable care to business invitees, including Plaintiff, to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to promptly address and/or warn of dangerous conditions. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.,* 448 Mass. 780, 783 (2007).  
18. Defendant breached this duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to timely clean up the spilled milk in the dairy aisle;  
   b. Failing to place warning signs, cones, or other markers near the spill to alert customers of the dangerous condition; and  
   c. Allowing a hazardous condition to persist for an unreasonable length of time despite having actual knowledge of the condition.  
19. Defendant’s negligence constitutes a violation of its duties under Massachusetts common law and statutory law, as set forth in cases such as *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.,* 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973), and *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,* 400 Mass. 837, 841 (1987).  
20. Defendant's failure to act as a reasonably prudent entity under similar circumstances directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  
21. Massachusetts law recognizes that premises owners must exercise reasonable care to protect lawful visitors from hazardous conditions that they knew or should have known about. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.,* 457 Mass. 368, 370 (2010).  
22. Defendant’s failure to address or warn of the spilled milk is further established as negligence under Massachusetts precedents, including but not limited to *Greene v. Boston Housing Auth.,* 10 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 416 (1980) and *Dubois v. Powdrell, 271 Mass. 394, 396 (1930).
