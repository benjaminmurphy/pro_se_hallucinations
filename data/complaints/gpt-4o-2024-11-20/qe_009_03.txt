**SPRINGFIELD DISTRICT COURT**  
______________________________  

**Jessica Morgan**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Thomas Reed**  
Defendant.  

**Case No. _______**  

**COMPLAINT**  

Plaintiff Jessica Morgan (“Plaintiff”) brings this complaint against Defendant Thomas Reed (“Defendant”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law and alleges as follows:  

---

### **PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Morgan is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, where she has resided as a tenant since May 1, 2022.  

2. Defendant Thomas Reed is the owner and landlord of 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Defendant was responsible for maintaining the premises and ensuring compliance with applicable housing laws.  

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in Springfield District Court under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 19, because the rental property is located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the acts or omissions forming the basis of this complaint occurred in Springfield.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

4. Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant on or about May 1, 2022, to lease a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA, in exchange for monthly rent of $1,600.  

5. Under Massachusetts law, including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, Defendant owes Plaintiff the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including the obligation to ensure that the rental property is reasonably fit for habitation and free from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises.  

6. Beginning on or about October 18, 2025, Plaintiff’s apartment became partially uninhabitable due to an electrical failure affecting one of the two bedrooms of the unit. The electrical failure rendered all outlets and lighting fixtures in that room inoperable, preventing Plaintiff's use of the space as a home office.  

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the situation. Defendant sent an electrician to assess the issue, but the repair was not completed. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the repair required additional work but failed to take necessary steps to timely resolve the problem, stating that the repair was “complicated” due to the building’s wiring.  

8. As of the date of this filing, more than six weeks after Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the issue, the electrical problem remains unresolved.  

9. The lack of electricity and lighting in one of the bedrooms has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her apartment.  

10. Plaintiff was using the affected bedroom as a home office and has been forced to seek alternative workspaces, incurring additional out-of-pocket expenses, including:  
   a. Approximately $15 per day in expenses for coffee and food while working from coffee shops;  
   b. Membership costs for a coworking space at a rate of $150 per month.  

11. Plaintiff has also been forced to relocate office furniture and equipment to other areas of the apartment, making the entire space cramped and uncomfortable.  

12. Defendant’s failure to resolve the issue in a timely manner breaches Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

13. As a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including out-of-pocket expenses, diminished use and enjoyment of her apartment, and significant disruption to her daily life.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14)**  

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  

15. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts carries with it an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from interfering with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the rental property.  

16. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by allowing a substantial deficiency in the premises that has persisted for over six weeks, despite notice of the issue and multiple opportunities to resolve it.  

17. The electrical failure in Plaintiff’s apartment constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, as defined under Massachusetts case law, including *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 275 (1994) (affirming that substantial interference with use constitutes a violation of quiet enjoyment).  

18. Defendant’s failure to make timely repairs violates his obligations under Massachusetts law, including his duties to maintain the premises in habitable condition under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, and to avoid causing or permitting a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the property.  

19. Plaintiff has suffered monetary and non-monetary damages as a direct result of Defendant’s conduct, including the loss of use of a bedroom, additional work-related expenses, and disruption to the peaceful enjoyment of her apartment.  

20. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, which provides for compensation for actual damages, three times the amount of actual damages, and costs of litigation, including attorney’s fees.

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of actual damages in the amount of $1,200, to compensate Plaintiff for out-of-pocket expenses and diminished use of the premises;  

2. Treble damages pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, for a total damages award of $3,600;  

3. Costs of this action, including filing fees, service costs, and any other related expenses;  

4. Any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.
