While it does not use the exact words \u201csubstantially interfere,\u201d it adopts that concept by defining quiet enjoyment as freedom from serious interferences that impair the character and value of the premises and by holding the landlord liable where repeated flooding interfered with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment.

In Section B, the court holds that the landlord\u2019s violation of the security deposit statute triggers liability for \u201ctreble damages, interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and in Section C it explains that under the Boston rent control ordinance, non\u2011willful violations are limited to actual overcharge while more culpable conduct allows up to three times the overcharge. Although the opinion focuses more on statutory triggers than on a general scienter standard, it does reflect that enhanced/treble damages are tied to the nature of the violation and, in the ordinance context, to wilfulness.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We thus agree with the tenant that subsection (7) is applicable to these circumstances and, accordingly, that Young is liable for treble damages, interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees.\n...\nThe tenant is, however, entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the ordinance, as \u00a7 9 expressly provides for liability for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs for any person who \u201creceives, or retains any payment of rent, in excess of the maximum lawful rent.\u201d A showing that a violation is neither wilful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions merely limits the amount of liquidated damages to the amount of the overcharge."

It does not mention landlord-tenant law, habitability, breach claims, or any issue related to space heater use or tenant expenses. Therefore, it cannot provide authority for the proposition about space heater use as a tenant expense in breach claims.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "As an alternative avenue of relief, the board of appeals granted Marasco a variance to build a new garage within six and a half feet of the westerly sideline of Surfside Terrace. It did so on the ground that ancient oak trees made the location of the garage closer to the way desirable. That something may be desirable does not, however, rise to the dignity of a hardship. No case has been called to attention in which the location of a tree qualified as \u201ccircumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land.\u201d G.

He further states that by renting, landlords impliedly agree the unit complies with those standards and will be maintained accordingly, which is a clear recognition of a landlord\u2019s duty to provide habitable housing.
