**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emma Thompson, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the judgment concerning custody and parenting time entered on May 15, 2022, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court. Plaintiff states there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances such that the current custody order is no longer in the best interests of the parties’ minor child, Sophia Miller, age 10. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff alleges as follows:**  

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Emma Thompson resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Sophia Miller.  
2. Defendant David Miller resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Sophia Miller.  

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. The parties were previously before this Court in connection with child custody and parenting time issues, resulting in a Judgment entered on May 15, 2022. This Court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over all matters concerning custody and parenting time pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

4. Under the existing judgment, the Plaintiff has primary residential custody of the minor child, Sophia Miller, and the parties share legal custody. The Defendant exercises substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sundays, and both parties are required to cooperate on school-related decisions.  
5. At the time the May 15, 2022 judgment was entered, Sophia Miller was performing well in school and had no attendance or academic issues. Both parents were able to support her educational development without significant conflict or interruption.  
6. Over the past year, and subsequent to the entry of the current judgment, the Defendant has failed to ensure the minor child’s consistent attendance at school and has repeatedly disregarded the child’s academic needs during his parenting time. Specifically:  
   a. On numerous occasions, the Defendant has kept the child home from school on Mondays following his weekend overnights, citing the need for “mental health days.” These absences are unexcused, and no medical documentation has been provided.  
   b. The cumulative impact of these absences has led to school truancy warnings being issued to the Plaintiff as the primary residential parent.  
   c. As a result of these absences, Sophia’s grades and academic performance have declined, as evidenced by falling test scores and negative feedback from her teachers.  
7. Additionally, the Defendant has consistently failed to take the minor child to tutoring sessions that are scheduled during his parenting time. These sessions, which have been specifically recommended by her school, are essential to addressing her academic struggles.  
8. The Defendant's actions have caused ongoing harm to Sophia’s educational stability and wellbeing, as consistent school attendance and academic support are critical to her development.  

---

### **MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

9. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2022 judgment:  
   a. The minor child’s academic needs have drastically increased due to her falling performance and truancy.  
   b. The Defendant has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to prioritize the child’s educational needs during his parenting time.  
   c. This pattern of behavior was not anticipated at the time the existing custody order was entered.  
10. The current parenting arrangement, particularly Defendant’s Sunday overnights and shared legal custody regarding school-related decisions, is no longer in Sophia’s best interests and has created conflict and instability that negatively affect her education.  

---

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

11. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the current judgment to better serve the minor child’s best interests, considering her academic struggles and the Defendant’s failure to ensure educational stability.  
12. Plaintiff requests that the Court:  
   a. Modify the existing judgment to grant Plaintiff sole legal custody over school attendance and academic decisions pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, in light of the Defendant’s failure to appropriately address Sophia’s educational needs.  
   b. Alternatively, modify the parenting schedule to eliminate Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time, thereby ensuring that the child is consistently attending school on Mondays.  
   c. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

---

### **RELEVANT LAW AND AUTHORITIES**  

13. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Court may modify a custody or parenting time order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and when modification is in the best interests of the child.  
14. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that the best interests of the child shall govern custody and parenting time decisions. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  
15. The failure of a parent to ensure consistent school attendance has been recognized as grounds for modification of custody or parenting time. See Williams v. Massa, 431 Mass. 619 (2000).  
16. Shared legal custody requires the ability of parents to communicate and cooperate effectively in matters of importance to the child’s welfare, including education. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  
17. A material and substantial decline in a child’s academic performance constitutes a significant change in circumstances under G.L. c. 208, § 28. See Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  
18. Courts have consistently emphasized the critical importance of educational stability for a child’s development. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
19. A parent’s refusal to follow through with agreed-upon services, such as tutoring, is contrary to a child’s best interests. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).  
20. The Court may reduce parenting time if a parent’s behavior disrupts the child’s welfare. See Pearson v. Pearson, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 156 (2001).  
21. Modification to sole legal custody is appropriate when one parent fails to make decisions in the child’s best interests. See Carr v. Carr, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 924 (1998).  
22. Frequent truancy and lack of educational support can justify significant changes to custody arrangements. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

### **WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:**  

1. Enter an Order modifying the current custody arrangement to grant Plaintiff sole legal custody over Sophia Miller in regard to school attendance and academic decisions;  
2. Alternatively, enter an Order modifying the parenting time schedule to eliminate Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time;  
3. Enter such other orders as are just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  
this 1st day of December, 2025.
