### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**BRISTOL COUNTY**  

**Docket No.:** ___________  

**Emily Johnson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant.

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

**Now comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and respectfully complains as follows:**  

---

### PARTIES  
1. Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is the custodial parent of Liam Smith, age 9, and resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff’s contact information is as follows: phone number (617) 555-0123; email address: psm1443@gmail.com.  

2. Michael Smith (“Defendant”) is the non-custodial parent of Liam Smith and resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

---

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND  
3. By an Order of this Court dated September 15, 2021 (the “Custody Order”), Plaintiff and Defendant were awarded shared legal custody of Liam Smith, age 9. Said Custody Order provided that Liam primarily reside with the Plaintiff while spending certain weekends with the Defendant.  

4. The Custody Order was entered at a time when both parties were presumed capable of co-parenting and providing a safe and stable environment for Liam.  

5. Since the Custody Order was issued, circumstances have materially changed, and the Defendant’s behavior has created an unsafe environment for the child during overnight visits.  

6. In recent months, Liam has repeatedly reported to Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” consumed at Defendant’s home and that the Defendant “can’t walk straight” after drinking such beverages.

7. Plaintiff has obtained video evidence from a neighbor showing Defendant stumbling while attempting to remove Liam from the car late at night.  

8. Additionally, Liam’s school has reported that he appears unusually exhausted every Monday morning following the weekends spent with Defendant, suggesting that his well-being is being adversely affected.  

9. These developments indicate a material change in circumstances that significantly impact Liam’s safety and welfare, necessitating the modification of the current Custody Order.

### LEGAL STANDARDS AND AUTHORITY  
10. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28, the Court may modify custody orders if a material and substantial change in circumstances affects the best interests of the child.  

11. In determining whether to modify custody, the overriding consideration is the best interests of the child. See **Gediman v. Gediman, 202 Mass. 209 (1909)** and **El Chaar v. Chehab, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 501 (2010)**.  

12. Evidence of instability or substance use by a parent is relevant to the Court’s determination of a material change in circumstances. See **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**.  

13. Parental alcohol use that impairs judgment or creates an unsafe environment for the child supports modification of custody arrangements. See **Guardianship of Estelle, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007)**.  

14. The Court has full discretion to impose specific conditions on parenting time, including supervised visitation or restrictions, to ensure the safety of the child. See **Allen v. Allen, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 1105 (2018)**.  

15. A parent’s right to visitation does not supersede the child’s need for a safe and stable living environment. See **Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002)**.  

16. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) standards prioritize close parental relationships, but not at the cost of endangering the child. See **Adoption of Nancy, 443 Mass. 512 (2005)**.  

17. As modifying custody falls within the Court’s equitable powers, the Court has the authority to fashion relief that prioritizes the safety and well-being of the child over rigid adherence to prior orders. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**.  

18. Given that Liam’s safety and welfare have been called into question, there is a compelling need to reevaluate and modify the current Custody Order in furtherance of his best interests.  

---

### RELIEF REQUESTED  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the existing Custody Order dated September 15, 2021, to provide that Defendant’s parenting time with Liam Smith take place under supervised conditions or with appropriate restrictions.  
2. Order that Defendant refrain from consuming alcohol during or within 12 hours prior to parenting time with Liam Smith.  
3. Order such additional relief or conditions as this Honorable Court deems necessary and appropriate to protect the health, safety, and best interests of Liam Smith.
