**Plaintiff**  
v.  
**Susan Blake**  
**Defendant**  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
**CIVIL COMPLAINT**  
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Carter, brings this action against Defendant, Susan Blake, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as set forth in G.L. c. 186, § 14 and under common law principles.  
2. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages arising from substantial interference with their use and enjoyment of their rental premises, as well as other remedies provided by law.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff, Jordan Carter, is an individual residing at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA 02119.  
4. Defendant, Susan Blake, is the owner and landlord of the residential premises located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA 02119, where Plaintiff has resided since March 1, 2022.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and G.L. c. 214, § 3.  
6. Venue in Boston Housing Court is proper because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Boston, Massachusetts, and the property where the dispute arose is within this Court's jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for the basement apartment located at 45 Waverly Street, Roxbury, MA, at a rent of $1,200 per month.  
8. Plaintiff paid rent timely and in full during the tenancy, except for a delay in October 2025, during which Plaintiff was two weeks late in paying rent. Plaintiff subsequently paid the full rent amount and the applicable late fee.  
9. In or around November 2025, Plaintiff observed water seeping through the interior wall of the basement apartment during heavy rains, causing damage to Plaintiff’s personal belongings, including a rug and a bookshelf, valued at approximately $400.  
10. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the water intrusion by text message shortly after its discovery. Defendant responded that she would “look into it.” However, no steps were taken to address the issue.  
11. After several weeks of inaction by Defendant, Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services Department. Inspectors visited the apartment, documented the water intrusion and additional code violations, and required corrective measures.  
12. Despite the findings of the Inspectional Services Department, Defendant has yet to address the water intrusion and associated issues, forcing Plaintiff to intermittently run a dehumidifier, which has increased Plaintiff’s utility costs.  
13. Following the inspection, Defendant informed Plaintiff that their lease would not be renewed when it expires in March 2026, citing the October 2025 rent delay as the reason. However, Plaintiff believes this non-renewal is retaliatory and directly linked to their report to the City of Boston.  
14. Defendant’s failure to repair the water intrusion has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, violating Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, §14.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above.  
16. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment that protects tenants from substantial interference with their tenancy by landlords or their agents.  
17. Defendant’s failure to remedy the water intrusion problem, which caused property damage, increased utility expenses, and created an untenable rental environment, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the premises, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
18. Defendant’s failure to take action despite repeated notice of the conditions demonstrates willful or knowing disregard for Plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights, thereby entitling Plaintiff to remedies under the statute.  
19. Defendant’s attempt to terminate or non-renew Plaintiff’s lease in apparent retaliation for Plaintiff exercising their right to report code violations constitutes further interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and is prohibited under Massachusetts law.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in their favor and award the following relief:  
a. Monetary damages in the amount of $400 to compensate Plaintiff for property damage caused by water intrusion;  
b. Additional monetary damages for increased utility costs resulting from Defendant’s failure to make necessary repairs;  
c. Statutory damages as provided under G.L. c. 186, § 14, including actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater;  
d. Attorneys’ fees and costs of this action as provided by statute;  
e. Any further relief this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
