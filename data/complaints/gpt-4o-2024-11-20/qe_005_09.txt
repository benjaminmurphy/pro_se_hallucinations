Plaintiff  

v.  

**Mark Lawson**  
(Address withheld for privacy purposes)  
Defendant  

**Civil Action No.: [To be assigned]**  

**COMPLAINT**

**PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”) is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who resides at 12 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.
2. Defendant Mark Lawson (“Defendant”) is Plaintiff’s landlord, who owns and manages the residential property located at 12 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the matter in controversy does not exceed $50,000, and the cause of action arose in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts.
4. Venue is proper in this Court because the property at issue is located in Somerville, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement (“Lease”) with Defendant for the rental of Apartment 2 at 12 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,800. 
6. The Lease explicitly includes Plaintiff’s right to the “quiet enjoyment” of the leased premises, in accordance with Massachusetts law. 
7. Since approximately June 1, 2025, Plaintiff has experienced excessive and ongoing noise disturbances caused by the tenants residing in 12 Elm Street, Apartment 3, a unit in the same building owned and managed by Defendant.
8. Noise disturbances have included, but are not limited to, loud stomping, late-night music, furniture dragging, and other disruptive activities occurring at all hours of the day and night. These disturbances have been particularly severe during the nighttime hours of 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.
9. Plaintiff has made numerous complaints to Defendant regarding the ongoing disturbances, including at least five written or verbal complaints between June 2025 and November 2025. Despite these notifications, Defendant has failed to take adequate or meaningful steps to address the issue.
10. Defendant undertook minimal action by speaking to the tenants of Apartment 3 on one occasion, but the disturbances persisted unabated.
11. As a direct result of the noise disturbances, Plaintiff has been unable to obtain reasonable sleep, averaging only four to five hours per night. This has caused Plaintiff significant emotional distress, physical exhaustion, and negative consequences at her place of employment, including a formal written warning for falling asleep at work.
12. Due to the lack of sleep caused by the noise disturbances, Plaintiff has incurred additional expenses, including $40 per month for prescribed sleep medication. Plaintiff has also purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and other items in an attempt to mitigate the disturbances, all to no avail.
13. Defendant’s failure to resolve the noise disturbances constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory and contractual right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises under Massachusetts law.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law provides that a landlord shall not interfere with a tenant’s legal right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, and any such interference constitutes a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
16. The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is also codified in the Lease between Plaintiff and Defendant.  
17. Defendant breached Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment by failing to take meaningful action to stop the unreasonable noise disturbances caused by other tenants in the building, despite repeated notice of said disturbances.  
18. Defendant’s inaction has made Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the apartment significantly less comfortable and convenient than intended under the Lease.  
19. Defendant’s failure to ensure quiet enjoyment has caused Plaintiff substantial harm, including but not limited to emotional distress, physical exhaustion, lost productivity at work, additional financial expenses, and a diminished quality of life.  
20. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for actual damages, statutory damages of at least one month’s rent, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

A. An award of actual damages in the amount of $5,000 or such other amount as may be proven at trial, to compensate Plaintiff for the harm caused by Defendant’s breach of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Statutory damages in an amount equal to one month’s rent, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
C. Costs of this action, including but not limited to court filing fees and any other reasonable costs; and  
D. Any other relief that this Court deems just and equitable.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
