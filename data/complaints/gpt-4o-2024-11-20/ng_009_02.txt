**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**LYNN DISTRICT COURT**  

**JENNA MITCHELL,**    
*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
**LYNN APARTMENT MANAGEMENT LLC,**    
*Defendant.*  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. ____________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jenna Mitchell, is an individual residing at 100 Maple Street, Apartment 3, Lynn, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Lynn Apartment Management LLC, is a limited liability company registered and organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a principal place of business or management office located in Lynn, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Lynn District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, as the Defendant conducts business in this jurisdiction and the acts complained of occurred within this jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Plaintiff Jenna Mitchell is a tenant at 100 Maple Street, Apartment 3, Lynn, Massachusetts (the "Premises"), which is owned and managed by Defendant Lynn Apartment Management LLC (the “Defendant”).  
6. Under Massachusetts law and pursuant to established landlord-tenant obligations, including G.L. c. 143, § 51 and G.L. c. 148, § 26E, Defendant has a duty to maintain functional smoke detectors in the common areas of rental properties to protect tenant safety.  
7. From at least July 2023 through September 15, 2023, the smoke detector located in the hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s third-floor apartment was not functioning, as its battery had been removed.  
8. On multiple occasions during this period, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the malfunctioning smoke detector, stating explicitly that the detector was not operational and posed a safety risk. Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff that the issue would be addressed but failed to take appropriate action to replace the battery or otherwise repair the detector.  
9. On September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment at the Premises. The fire is believed to have originated in a kitchen area and quickly spread smoke throughout the building's common areas, including the stairwell and hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment.  
10. Because the smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was non-functional, no audible warning alerted Plaintiff to the fire at an early stage. Plaintiff became aware of the fire only after smelling smoke, by which time the hallway was already filled with dense, hazardous smoke.  
11. Plaintiff suffered significant difficulty breathing due to the smoke and experienced severe fear and distress while attempting to evacuate the building. Plaintiff was hospitalized overnight for treatment of smoke inhalation and related injuries.  
12. In addition to Plaintiff’s physical and emotional injuries, many of Plaintiff’s personal belongings were damaged by smoke and water during the fire and firefighting efforts.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
14. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff, as her landlord, to maintain the Premises, including common areas and safety devices such as smoke detectors, in a reasonably safe condition and in compliance with applicable laws. See *Hemingway v. Chiampa*, 400 Mass. 491 (1987); G.L. c. 186, § 15.  
15. Pursuant to G.L. c. 143, § 51, G.L. c. 148, § 26E, and related Massachusetts regulations, landlords are required to install and maintain functional smoke detectors in rental properties to ensure tenant safety.  
16. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to maintain the smoke detector located in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment in a functional condition, despite actual knowledge that the detector was non-functional as a result of battery removal. See *Pagan v. Gonzalez*, 113 Mass. App. Ct. 863 (2023).  
17. Defendant’s failure to repair or replace the smoke detector despite repeated notice of its malfunction created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff in the event of a fire.  
18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injury (smoke inhalation requiring hospitalization), emotional distress, and damage to personal property. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
19. Defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries, and Defendant is therefore liable to Plaintiff for damages. See *Leibovich v. Antonellis*, 410 Mass. 568 (1991).  

**DAMAGES**  

20. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred the following damages:  
    a. Medical expenses of approximately $4,500 for treatment of smoke inhalation;  
    b. Lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to missed work;  
    c. Damage to personal property, the value of which will be determined at trial but is believed to exceed $3,000; and  
    d. Severe emotional distress and pain and suffering arising out of Plaintiff's injuries and the traumatic experience of the fire. See *Agis v. Howard Johnson Co.*, 371 Mass. 140 (1976).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;  
2. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:  
    a. Medical expenses;  
    b. Lost wages;  
    c. Property damage; and  
    d. Emotional distress and pain and suffering;  
3. Award Plaintiff prejudgment interest, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees as permitted by law; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
