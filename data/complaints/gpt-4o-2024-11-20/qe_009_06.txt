**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant beginning on or about June 1, 2022, for a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff pays $1,200 in monthly rent.  

7. As part of the lease, Defendant covenanted to provide Plaintiff with a habitable apartment, free from substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the premises, as required by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and associated case law.  

8. Beginning in or around October 15, 2025, the electrical outlets and overhead light in one bedroom of the apartment stopped functioning.  

9. The malfunction was caused by issues in the building’s wiring, which Defendant has failed to repair despite his legal obligations.  

10. Defendant sent an electrician to inspect the issue, who indicated to Plaintiff that the condition required substantial work to resolve. However, since that time, Defendant has delayed repairs, stating that he is obtaining quotes and that the repair is "complicated" due to the building's old wiring.  

11. For the six weeks following the onset of the electrical failure, the issue has remained unresolved, rendering the bedroom unusable as Plaintiff's home office.  

12. As a direct consequence of Defendant’s failure to timely remedy this issue, Plaintiff has had to incur significant additional expenses, including daily costs for using coffee shops ($15 per day) and a coworking space membership ($150 per month). Plaintiff has also been forced to move her office equipment to her living room, disrupting the quiet enjoyment of the entire apartment.  

13. Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of the need for repairs and her inability to use the bedroom, and Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable steps to remedy the situation.

14. Defendant’s failure to repair the electrical system amounts to a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and quiet enjoyment of the premises, in violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

15. As a result of Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including out-of-pocket costs and emotional distress. Plaintiff estimates her total damages to be approximately $900 and reserves the right to amend this amount.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, "any lessor or landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant" shall be liable to the tenant for actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including attorney's fees.  

18. Defendant’s failure to remedy the hazardous electrical condition and inability to restore the usability of one bedroom of Plaintiff's apartment constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises, in direct violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

19. Defendant’s failure to repair was willful and reckless, exposing Plaintiff to significant hardship and out-of-pocket financial losses.  

20. Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages in the amount of $900, the greater of three months' rent as statutory damages ($3,600), and costs of bringing this action as provided by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.
