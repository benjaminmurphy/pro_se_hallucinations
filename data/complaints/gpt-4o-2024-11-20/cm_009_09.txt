   Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MARK JOHNSON**,  
   Defendant.  
___________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the custody order entered on January 15, 2019, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and other applicable Massachusetts law. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, resides in [insert current town of Plaintiff], Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the parents of a minor child, Emma Johnson, born [insert DOB], who resides primarily with Plaintiff by virtue of the custody order issued in this matter on January 15, 2019, by the Barnstable Probate and Family Court.  

---

### **JURISDICTION**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as it is the custodial court that issued the original custody order and because both parties and the minor child reside in Massachusetts.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On January 15, 2019, the Barnstable Probate and Family Court issued a custody order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, Emma Johnson. The order also granted the Defendant parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.  
6. At the time the original order was issued, both the Plaintiff and Defendant resided in the same town, and implementing the Wednesday overnight arrangement did not require extensive travel.  
7. In 2023, Defendant relocated to Cape Cod, creating significant logistical challenges for the midweek overnight. Defendant’s residence is now more than 90 miles from the minor child’s school and Plaintiff’s residence.  
8. Despite this relocation, Defendant insists on exercising his midweek overnight parenting time according to the original custody order.  
9. Defendant picks the minor child up from school on Wednesdays, drives approximately 90 miles to Cape Cod, and then wakes the child around 4:30 AM on Thursday mornings to drive her back to school.  
10. The minor child, who is now eight years old, has experienced negative consequences as a result of this routine.  
   a. The minor child frequently arrives at school exhausted on Thursdays.  
   b. The child’s teacher has reported a noticeable decline in her participation in classroom activities on Thursdays, which Plaintiff believes is directly attributable to the demanding weekday travel schedule.  
11. As a result of these circumstances, the original order no longer serves the best interests of the minor child and requires modification.  
12. The adjustment sought by the Plaintiff is necessary to ensure the child’s well-being and continued academic success without the undue burden of excessive weekday travel.  
13. Plaintiff has acted in good faith to resolve this issue with the Defendant, but no agreement has been reached, and court intervention is necessary to address the matter appropriately.

### **MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

14. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the January 15, 2019, custody order, specifically the Defendant’s relocation to Cape Cod and its impact on the Wednesday overnight parenting schedule.  
15. This change in circumstances directly impacts the minor child’s best interests, particularly regarding her education, health, and general welfare, which require the Court’s intervention to address.  
16. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in any determination regarding custody and parenting time.  

---

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
A. Modify the custody order issued on January 15, 2019, by eliminating the Defendant’s midweek overnight parenting time on Wednesdays.  
B. Adjust the Defendant’s parenting time schedule to an arrangement that minimizes the minor child’s travel burden during the school week and is consistent with her best interests.  
C. Grant such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

---
