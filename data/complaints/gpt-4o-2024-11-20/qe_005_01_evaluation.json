It does not address sleep disruption, noise, or similar interferences with peaceful use of the premises, nor does it articulate any rule specific to substantial interference with sleep. Therefore it cannot be cited as authority for the specific proposition that substantial interference with a tenant\u2019s sleep violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures."

The facts involve repeated nighttime flooding with water and sewage that forced the tenant out of bed and caused significant emotional distress, which the court recognizes as interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. This comfortably encompasses substantial interferences with sleep and peaceful residential use as violating quiet enjoyment, even though the damages award on that count was vacated as duplicative.",
