**LISA TAYLOR**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK TAYLOR**,  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, residing in the County of Middlesex, Massachusetts, who respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the Judgment issued on May 20, 2015, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court concerning custody and visitation of the minor child, Emily Taylor. In support thereof, Plaintiff hereby states as follows:**

---

### **1. PARTIES**  

1.1 The Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, is the mother of the minor child, Emily Taylor, and resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

1.2 The Defendant, Mark Taylor, is the father of the minor child, Emily Taylor, and also resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

---

### **2. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

2.1 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C and G.L. c. 215, as this Complaint is for a modification of child custody and visitation, which were previously determined by this Court.

2.2 Venue is proper in this Court because both parties and the minor child reside in Middlesex County, and the original Judgment was entered by this Court.

---

### **3. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

3.1 The Judgment entered on May 20, 2015, awarded primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Taylor, to the Defendant, Mark Taylor, with the Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, receiving limited visitation, including weekends and one weeknight dinner per week.

3.2 At the time the Judgment was entered, the Plaintiff was a graduate student with limited housing and availability due to her academic commitments and financial constraints.

3.3 Since the entry of the original custody order, a substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred, as detailed below:  
  - The Plaintiff has completed her graduate education and is now employed in a stable, full-time position with predictable hours.  
  - The Plaintiff has secured appropriate, stable housing in a two-bedroom apartment in Middlesex County, where Emily has her own bedroom.  
  - The minor child, now 10 years old, has expressed a strong preference for increased time with the Plaintiff.  
  - The minor child has been engaged in emotional therapy, where her therapist reports that she feels distressed and guilty about the limited time spent with the Plaintiff and has expressed a desire for a more equitable parenting schedule.  
  - The Plaintiff and the minor child have developed a close and bonded relationship over the years.  
  - The Defendant has refused to consider modifications to the existing custody order, creating an impasse that necessitates judicial intervention.  

3.4 The minor child, Emily Taylor, has written a letter to the Court expressing a desire to spend more overnights in the Plaintiff's home, which is attached as **Exhibit A** to this Complaint.

3.5 The current custody arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the minor child, contrary to the guiding principles of Massachusetts family law, as outlined in G.L. c. 208, § 28, and related case law.

---

### **4. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION**

4.1 The standard for modification of custody orders under Massachusetts law is whether there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting a modification of the existing order and if such a modification is in the best interests of the child. See **G.L. c. 208, § 28**; see also **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**; **Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**.

4.2 In determining the best interests of the child, courts consider stability, the child's relationship with each parent, the fitness of each parent, and the preferences of older children capable of expressing a reasoned preference. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**.

4.3 Courts have also recognized that the passage of time and the natural evolving needs of growing children may warrant modification of custody arrangements originally made when the children were much younger. See **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**; **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.

4.4 Additional Massachusetts cases support the proposition that a parent with a substantially increased capacity to care for the child provides sufficient grounds for modification. See **Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006)**; **Custody of Mary, 414 Mass. 317 (1993)**.

4.5 Based on all of the foregoing, the Plaintiff has demonstrated a material and substantial change in circumstances that warrants modification of the current parenting plan to better serve the best interests of the minor child.

---

### **5. REQUESTED RELIEF**

**WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:**

5.1 Modify the custody and parenting time arrangement to provide the Plaintiff, Lisa Taylor, with joint physical custody and increased parenting time, including additional overnights during weekdays and weekends, as deemed appropriate by the Court.

5.2 Incorporate the minor child's expressed preference for spending additional time with the Plaintiff into the revised parenting plan.

5.3 Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
