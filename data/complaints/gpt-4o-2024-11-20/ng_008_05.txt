**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, was a business invitee dining at the Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts.  

8. At approximately 7:15 PM, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the narrow hallway connecting the kitchen to the dining room.  

9. The server promptly removed the broken glass but left a puddle of water and ice on the tiled floor of the hallway, stating she would “be right back with a mop.”  

10. No wet floor signs were placed by Defendant or its employees to warn patrons of the hazardous condition in the hallway.  

11. Plaintiff, unaware of the dangerous condition, attempted to walk through the hallway approximately ten minutes later to access the restroom.  

12. Plaintiff slipped and fell on the wet floor, twisting her knee.  

13. Plaintiff immediately experienced severe pain and later required medical attention.  

14. After the incident, Plaintiff overheard employees of Defendant commenting that they had been avoiding the puddle of water for some time but had not cleaned it up or warned patrons.  

15. Plaintiff visited urgent care the same evening and was diagnosed with a severe knee sprain, requiring her to wear a brace and undergo physical therapy for several weeks.  

16. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500 and lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability to work while recovering from her injuries.  

17. Defendant knew or should have known of the hazardous condition caused by the spilled water and exhibited negligence in failing to remedy the dangerous condition or adequately warn Plaintiff and other patrons of its existence.

**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**  
18. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 of this Complaint as though fully stated herein.  

19. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff as a business invitee to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to inspect, clean, and warn of any dangers. See *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to remove the spilled water and ice from the tiled hallway in a timely manner or to place warnings of the hazardous condition. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783-85 (2007).  

21. Defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition and the unreasonable risk it posed to patrons, yet failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to Plaintiff. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 369-70 (2010).

24. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligence in maintaining a wet and slippery tiled floor without warnings. See *Dindio v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., LLC*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 594 (2013).  

25. Defendant also breached its duty to act in a manner consistent with industry standards and reasonable restaurant safety protocols, further supporting its liability for Plaintiff’s injuries. See *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837, 850 (1987).
