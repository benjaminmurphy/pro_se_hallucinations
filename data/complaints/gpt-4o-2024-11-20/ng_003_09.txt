**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**MIDDLESEX COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO. [TO BE ASSIGNED]**

**Julia Thompson,**  
*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
**Bargain Home Goods, Inc.,**  
*Defendant.*

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**

**PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, Julia Thompson, is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts residing at [ADDRESS REDACTED], and at all relevant times was lawfully present as an invitee at the premises located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Bargain Home Goods, Inc., is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Massachusetts with its principal place of business at [ADDRESS REDACTED]. Defendant conducts retail business operations, including at the store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, where the incident described herein occurred.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction is proper in this court under G.L. c. 212, § 4, as this court has general jurisdiction over tort claims, and the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory minimum threshold for Superior Court jurisdiction.  
4. Venue is proper in this court under G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully present as a customer at the Bargain Home Goods, Inc. store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  
6. In the aisles of Defendant’s store, large, heavy boxes of kitchen appliances were negligently stacked without straps, barriers, rails, or any other reasonable precautions to secure and stabilize the items. Said boxes were stacked approximately five to six levels high, creating a dangerous and hazardous condition.  
7. While Plaintiff was shopping in the kitchenware aisle, another customer, while maneuvering a shopping cart, lightly bumped one of the lower shelves. As a direct result of this slight bump, a large box containing a toaster oven fell from the upper shelves and struck Plaintiff on her left shoulder and the side of her head.  
8. Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness, a throbbing headache, and pain in her shoulder. The store manager who observed the aftermath of the incident created an incident report and offered Plaintiff a store coupon.  
9. Later that evening, Plaintiff’s symptoms worsened significantly, prompting her to seek treatment at a local emergency room. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.  
10. As a result of her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for several days as a delivery driver, which resulted in lost wages of approximately $600. Plaintiff also missed several weeks of participation in her weekly soccer league, an activity that is a significant aspect of her recreational and social life.  
11. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the amount of approximately $1,800.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**

12. Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every preceding paragraph as if set forth fully herein.  
13. Defendant, as the owner and operator of the Bargain Home Goods store, owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to protect store patrons from hazardous conditions that could foreseeably result in injuries. See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  
14. Defendant breached its duty of care by negligently stacking heavy boxes of merchandise in an unsafe and unstable manner on upper store shelves without adequate restraints or precautions, thereby creating an unreasonable risk of harm to invitees. See Bernier v. Boston Edison Co., 380 Mass. 372, 378–79 (1980).  
15. Defendant further failed to inspect the shelving and merchandise adequately and to address the dangerous condition, despite the foreseeability that a slight disturbance to the shelving, such as a customer bumping a shelf with a cart, could lead to the collapse of unsecured items. See Ravo v. James W. Edwards, Inc., 6 Mass. App. Ct. 929 (1978).  
16. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to warn against the latent danger posed by the improperly stacked boxes, but failed to provide any such warning. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010).  
17. As a direct and proximate result of this negligence, Plaintiff suffered the injuries and damages described herein. See Scott v. Garfield, 454 Mass. 790 (2009).  
18. Defendant’s negligence constitutes a breach of its obligations under Massachusetts premises liability law. See G.L. c. 231, § 85.  

**DAMAGES**

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained personal injuries, economic losses, and emotional distress, including but not limited to:  
   a. Medical expenses totaling approximately $1,800;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $600;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering; and  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life and recreational activities.  

20. Plaintiff’s injuries were foreseeable and resulted entirely from Defendant’s negligence and the hazardous condition Defendant created and maintained on its premises.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Julia Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  
1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including economic and non-economic damages;  
2. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  
3. Costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and  
4. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable as of right.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
