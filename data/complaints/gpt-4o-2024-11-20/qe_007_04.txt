**EMILY JOHNSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**DAVID THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, which arises from Defendant's failure to ensure Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of the premises she rents at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.  

---

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  

2. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment #2, Cambridge, MA 02139.  

3. Defendant, David Thompson, is an individual and the owner and lessor of the apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and venue is proper in this District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the premises at issue and the underlying events are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the Cambridge District Court.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a written residential lease agreement with Defendant, agreeing to rent the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, for $2200 per month.  

6. Plaintiff has remained a tenant in good standing and has consistently paid her rent in full and on time as required under the lease.  

7. In or around October 1, 2025, Defendant commenced renovations on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment.  

8. Since the renovations began, Plaintiff has been subjected to excessive daytime noise, including but not limited to drilling, hammering, and workers speaking loudly. These disturbances typically occur from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and disrupt Plaintiff’s ability to work from home.  

9. Construction has also caused dust and debris to enter Plaintiff’s unit through ventilation systems.  

10. Defendant failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the impact of the renovations on Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment of her home.  

11. Defendant offered Plaintiff a minimal one-time rent reduction of $100, which does not adequately compensate her for the loss of quiet enjoyment of her premises.  

12. Despite notice and complaints from Plaintiff, Defendant has allowed the construction to continue unabated for over two months, and construction is projected to last an additional month or more.  

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered significant interference with her ability to fully use and enjoy her rental unit, including, but not limited to, the inability to effectively work from home and emotional distress caused by the disruptions.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

14. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-13 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that tenants shall not be subjected to significant interference with the use and enjoyment of their rental premises by the landlord or landlord’s agents.  

16. Defendant’s failure to prevent or adequately address ongoing construction noise, dust infiltration, and disruption caused by renovations constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

17. Defendant’s conduct constitutes “interference, directly or indirectly, with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant,” as prohibited under Massachusetts law.  

18. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a result of Defendant's breach, including the inability to effectively work from home, annoyance, emotional distress, and diminished value of her tenancy.  

19. Massachusetts courts have recognized that a landlord’s activities causing substantial interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment give rise to liability, even where the landlord may not have acted maliciously. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 283-84 (1994); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997).  

20. Defendant’s actions also fall within the scope of the protections articulated in *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982), which held that landlords may be liable where their actions cause significant disruption to tenants’ enjoyment of their residences.  

21. Defendant is liable under Massachusetts law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment due to the repeated and ongoing disturbances caused by construction activities.

**DAMAGES**  

22. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to:  

    a. Interference with her ability to use and enjoy her rental unit;  
    b. Loss of productivity and income due to difficulty working from home;  
    c. Emotional distress caused by ongoing noise and dust infiltration; and  
    d. Diminished value of her tenancy.  

23. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and consequential damages, as well as the costs of this action, reasonable attorney’s fees, and, where appropriate, an award of damages of up to three months’ rent.  

24. Plaintiff estimates her damages to be not less than $1,000 and reserves the right to amend her calculations as necessary at trial.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant and grant the following relief:  

A. An award of actual and consequential damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of quiet enjoyment, emotional distress, and lost productivity, in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $1,000;  

B. Treble damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

C. An award of Plaintiff’s costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;
