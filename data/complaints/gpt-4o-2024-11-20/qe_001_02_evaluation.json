Normet explicitly states that the U.S. Constitution has not federalized landlord\u2013tenant law and that Oregon may treat landlord and tenant covenants as independent, rejecting any constitutional requirement that habitability or landlord repair obligations be recognized as a defense in an eviction for nonpayment. The Court does not hold that a covenant of quiet enjoyment includes a right to habitable conditions; instead, it notes that some states, by their own law, recognize an implied warranty of habitability but emphasizes that this is a matter for state law, not a constitutional mandate. Thus, the case does not support the proposition claimed and in fact cuts against treating habitability as necessarily included within quiet enjoyment as a constitutional matter.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cUnderlying appellants\u2019 claim is the assumption that they are denied due process of law unless Oregon recognizes the failure of the landlord to maintain the premises as an operative defense to the possessory FED action and as an adequate excuse for nonpayment of rent. The Constitution has not federalized the substantive law of landlord-tenant relations, however, and we see nothing to forbid Oregon from treating the undertakings of the tenant and those of the landlord as independent rather than dependent covenants. \u2026 Absent constitutional mandate, the assurance of adequate housing and the definition of landlord-tenant relationships are legislative, not judicial, functions.\u201d"

Habitability issues are analyzed under the implied warranty and as part of a Chapter 93A claim, while the quiet enjoyment claim is noted only in passing and not used to articulate any doctrine linking quiet enjoyment to habitability. Thus, the case does not serve as authority for the specific proposition that the covenant of quiet enjoyment includes the right to habitable conditions.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "After her landlord, the plaintiff Nick Haddad, commenced a summary process action in the Housing Court for the city of Boston for nonpayment of rent, the defendant, Luz Gonzalez, filed six counterclaims alleging: (1) breach of the implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L.c. 186, \u00a7 14 (1990 ed.); ... After a trial, a judge of the Housing Court found in favor of Gonzalez on all of her counterclaims\u2026 On the G.L.c. 93A counterclaim, the judge found that Gonzalez had suffered two discrete injuries\u2026 the diminution in value of the apartment due to Haddad's breach of the warranty of habitability."

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses the covenant and statutory right of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a714, but it does not involve or analyze a failure to provide basic services such as heat. Instead, it affirms a finding of no breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord promptly repaired noncritical defects. The only mention of lack of heat appears in a string-cite to Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas as an example from another case; Jablonski itself does not establish that failure to maintain heat is an unreasonable interference with quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Casey counterclaimed that York breached her covenant of quiet enjoyment. Similar to the warranty of habitability, during the rental of any residential premises, there exists an implied covenant and a statutory right of quiet enjoyment. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982); G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. We have interpreted this obligation to mean that the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from serious interference with her tenancy. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Authy., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994)."

The court recognizes substantial interference with beneficial enjoyment and loss of business income as compensable, but it does not discuss or award damages in the form of increased electric bills, medical expenses, or general household-type inconvenience to a residential plaintiff. Thus, while it supports substantial interference and business-related damages, it does not support the specific financial and medical components described in the proposition.",

The judge explains that by renting, the landlord impliedly agrees that the unit will comply with these legal standards at inception and during the tenancy, which necessarily covers systems and facilities vital to a habitable dwelling. Thus, it supports the proposition that a landlord\u2019s duty extends to maintaining systems necessary for habitability.",
