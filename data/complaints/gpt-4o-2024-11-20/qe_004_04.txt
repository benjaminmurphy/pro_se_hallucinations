### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about September 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of the Premises, located at 73 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605, at a monthly rent of $1,400.  
6. Since approximately September 2025, Plaintiff has noticed persistent mouse activity in the Premises, including frequent sightings of mouse droppings in the kitchen area.  
7. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant about the problem.  
8. While Defendant initially placed traps and arranged for an exterminator's single visit, the measures taken have been insufficient to resolve the infestation.  
9. Plaintiff continues to find mouse droppings on a regular basis and has lost use and enjoyment of her kitchen due to the infestation.  
10. Plaintiff has been forced to dispose of food that has become contaminated or suspect due to the presence of the infestation, incurring monetary damages of approximately $200 to date.  
11. Plaintiff additionally purchased sealed plastic containers for food storage to protect against infestation, incurring further costs of approximately $80.  
12. The ongoing infestation has caused Plaintiff substantial emotional distress and has interfered with her quiet enjoyment of the Premises, including anxiety and an ongoing fear of cooking and eating in her own kitchen.  
13. Plaintiff has repeatedly communicated with Defendant about the problem, but Defendant has failed to make sufficient or reasonable efforts to remediate the infestation, claiming that the problem is "normal for older buildings."  
14. Defendant’s response to the infestation has failed to meet his obligations as a landlord under Massachusetts law.

### IV. CAUSES OF ACTION  

#### Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

15. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every tenancy in Massachusetts carries with it an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prevents a landlord from directly or indirectly interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the rental property.  
17. A landlord’s failure to repair conditions that constitute the "serious interference" with a tenant’s tenancy may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994)**; **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997)**; **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982)**.  
18. The rodent infestation materially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to enjoy the Premises.  
19. Despite notice, Defendant failed to take adequate action to resolve the infestation, in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, and directly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
20. Emotional distress directly caused by conditions that breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment may be compensable damages under Massachusetts law. See **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982)**.  
21. Defendant’s failure to remediate the infestation amounts to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, entitling Plaintiff to damages as provided under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

---

### V. DAMAGES  

22. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to damages, including actual damages, emotional distress damages, and attorneys’ fees.  
23. Plaintiff suffered actual monetary damages totaling $280 as a direct result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment:  
    - $200 in lost food due to contamination from rodent infestation;  
    - $80 in expenses for purchasing food storage containers.  
24. Plaintiff also suffered emotional distress as a result of anxiety and ongoing discomfort stemming from the infestation and Defendant's failure to resolve it.  
25. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, the Court may impose damages of up to three months’ rent, or Plaintiff’s actual damages, whichever is greater.  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Reynolds respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

1. Award Plaintiff her actual damages, including but not limited to monetary losses and emotional distress damages, in an amount to be determined at trial;  
2. Award Plaintiff up to three months’ rent pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
3. Award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs in accordance with **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, notwithstanding that Plaintiff is self-represented;  
4. Grant any additional relief that this Court deems just and proper.
