The court states the new rule to be that the landlord renting a dwelling unit impliedly warrants to the tenant \u2018that the premises are fit for human occupation . . . [which] \u201c. . . means that at the inception of the rental there are no latent [or patent] defects in facilities vital to the use of the premises for residential purposes and that these essential facilities will remain during the entire term in a condition which makes the property livable.\u201d\u2019\u201d}"

The court affirms summary judgment for the landlord on the habitability claim, holding that the warranty concerns only physical facilities and is not breached by failure to provide security or remove criminal actors. Liability, if any, arises instead under statutory quiet enjoyment or G.L. c. 121B, not a habitability-based duty to repair defects affecting habitability in the sense suggested by the proposition.",

The plaintiffs have not alleged or shown any physical defect in the common areas of the rented premises amounting to a breach of the warranty of habitability... Therefore, the judge correctly granted summary judgment on the claim for breach of the warranty of habitability.\""

The affirmed damages for emotional distress are expressly tied to a separate tort claim for reckless infliction of emotional distress, not to breach of quiet enjoyment. Thus, the opinion recognizes emotional distress can be within \u00a7 14 damages but does not actually affirm an emotional-distress damages award for breach of quiet enjoyment in this case.",

The jury could only have reached this verdict by duplicating items of damage subsumed in Solomon\u2019s recoveries for breach of warranty and emotional injury\u2026 Accordingly, we vacate it.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cTherefore, we affirm the $35,000 and $1,000 verdicts in Solomon\u2019s favor.\u201d"

Although this is a concurrence/dissent and debates the doctrinal framing (implied warranty of habitability vs. implied agreement to meet Code standards), it clearly recognizes and elaborates a landlord\u2019s duty to keep residential premises in a minimally habitable condition.
