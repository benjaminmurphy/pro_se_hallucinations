The court emphasizes foreseeability of harm to visitors such as the plaintiff and holds that such foreseeable misuse does not break the chain of causation.

It was also reasonably foreseeable... that unauthorized operation would likely cause harm to persons known to pass through the area, such as those visiting the ships.\""

The court frames this in standard Massachusetts negligence terms (existence of duty, breach, causation, and foreseeability) and affirms a verdict against CVS based on a negligent failure to warn of a foreseeable, serious side effect. Thus, Cottam is correctly cited for the proposition that a duty to warn exists where harm is foreseeable and that negligent failure to meet that duty is actionable under Massachusetts law, albeit in the specific context of a voluntarily assumed duty by a pharmacy.",
