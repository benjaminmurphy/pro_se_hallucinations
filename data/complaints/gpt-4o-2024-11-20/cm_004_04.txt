**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**

**MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**

Docket No. __________  
**_________________________________________**  
**IN RE THE MATTER OF:**  

Jessica Turner,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

Mark Johnson,  
Defendant.  
**_________________________________________**

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, who respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the May 15, 2018 Custody and Parenting Order issued by this Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and for reasons set forth herein states as follows:**

### 1. **PARTIES**  
   - **Plaintiff**, Jessica Turner, resides at [Address], Massachusetts. The Plaintiff is the mother of Ethan Johnson, born April 5, 2017, age 8.  
   - **Defendant**, Mark Johnson, resides at [Address], Massachusetts. The Defendant is the father of Ethan Johnson.

### 2. **JURISDICTION**  
This Court has jurisdiction under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as a prior custody determination involving the minor child was rendered by this Court on May 15, 2018, and circumstances have materially changed since that time.

### 3. **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  
   1. On May 15, 2018, this Honorable Court issued an order granting the Plaintiff (Jessica Turner) primary physical custody of Ethan Johnson, with the Defendant (Mark Johnson) granted three short weekday visits and one Sunday afternoon visit per week. The Court explicitly denied overnight parenting time for the Defendant due to his then-inadequate housing situation, as the Defendant resided in a shared apartment with roommates where there was no dedicated, suitable sleeping area for their son.  
   2. At the time of the original judgment, the minor child, Ethan, was three (3) years old. He is now eight (8) years old, attends school full time, and has expressed a consistent desire to have longer visits, including overnight parenting time, with his father.  
   3. Since the May 15, 2018 custody order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, as follows:  
      - The Defendant, Mark Johnson, has significantly improved his living situation and now resides in his own apartment, where Ethan has his own bedroom.  
      - The short, frequent parenting schedule originally ordered is no longer appropriate for the child’s age and needs, as it disrupts school-night routines, increases transportation burdens, and causes exhaustion for all parties involved.  
      - Both parents, Jessica Turner and Mark Johnson, are in agreement that the current parenting schedule should be modified to permit regular overnight parenting time for the Defendant and to accommodate the minor child’s developmental, educational, and emotional needs.  

### 4. **APPLICABLE LAW AND CASELAW**  
The Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court modify the custody and parenting order consistent with the applicable law and Massachusetts caselaw:

   - G.L. c. 208, § 28, mandates that custody arrangements serve the best interests of the child.  
   - Under **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), Massachusetts courts consider the "best interests of the child" as paramount, and modifications are warranted based on material changes in circumstances that affect the child’s welfare.  
   - In **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the Supreme Judicial Court held that child custody orders should ensure stability while accommodating the changing needs of the child as they grow older.  
   - **Perez v. Santiago**, 86 Mass. App. Ct. 1119 (2014), emphasized that the material change standard is satisfied if changes in circumstances significantly affect the child’s well-being or parental availability.  
   - The Court in **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), underscored that frequent disruptions in routine, including during school nights, can negatively impact a child’s stability.  
   - **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), held that parental fitness and home environment are significant factors in custody modification decisions.  
   - In **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006), a child's growing need for stronger ties with both parents was recognized as a valid reason to restructure parenting plans.  
   - **Blanchette v. Blanchette**, 362 Mass. 518 (1972), emphasized that courts should continually assess the needs of the child as circumstances evolve.  
   - Per **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), a stable and nurturing environment, including appropriate housing, is critical to the child’s best interests.  
   - **Cavanaugh v. Cavanaugh**, 490 Mass. 398 (2022), reaffirmed that educational needs should be accommodated when crafting or modifying custody orders.

### 5. **REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
   1. Schedule a hearing to consider this Complaint for Modification;  
   2. Issue a modified custody and parenting order that includes regular overnight parenting time for Mark Johnson and reallocates parenting time to better accommodate the child’s school-night routine and developmental needs;  
   3. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
