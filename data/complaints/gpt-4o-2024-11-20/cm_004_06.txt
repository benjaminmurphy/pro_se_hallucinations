**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**BRISTOL COUNTY, SS**  
DOCKET NO. [INSERT DOCKET NUMBER]

**JESSICA THOMPSON**, PLAINTIFF  
v.  
**MARK RIVERA**, DEFENDANT  
**__________________________________________________________**

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

**1. Introduction and Jurisdiction**  
1.1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.  
1.2. The Defendant, Mark Rivera, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
1.3. This Court has jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to G.L. c. 209C § 20 and G.L. c. 208 § 28, as this matter concerns the custody and parenting time of a minor child and there has been a material change in circumstances necessitating modification of the most recent custody order issued by this Court on May 15, 2019.  

**2. Relevant Facts**  
2.1. Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of one minor child, Ethan Thompson, born on June [INSERT DAY], 2017, who is currently eight years old.  
2.2. On May 15, 2019, this Court entered an order granting Plaintiff primary physical custody of Ethan Thompson and awarding Defendant limited parenting time consisting of three short visits during the week and a Sunday afternoon visit, but no overnight parenting time. The order was based, in part, on Defendant’s living situation at the time, which was not conducive to overnight visitation.  
2.3. At the time the original custody order was issued, Defendant lived in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have adequate space for the child to stay overnight.  

2.4. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances. Specifically:  
   a. The Defendant now resides in his own apartment, where he has established an appropriate living environment for the minor child and has set up a separate bedroom exclusively for the child.  
   b. The minor child, now 8 years old, is in full-time school and is no longer a toddler.  
   c. The current custody schedule—which consists of fragmented, brief visits during the week—disrupts the child’s bedtime and homework routines, causing unnecessary stress and exhaustion for both the child and his parents.  
   d. The minor child has expressed a desire to spend additional and extended time with his father, including having overnight visits at his father’s residence.  
   e. Both parents agree that the current schedule is no longer feasible for the child’s age and developmental needs and have discussed potential modifications to better meet the child’s best interests.  

**3. Applicable Law**  
3.1. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208 § 28, child custody orders may be modified when a material and substantial change in circumstances makes modification necessary to serve the best interests of the child.  
3.2. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that the best interests of the child are paramount in custody matters. See *Blake v. Blake*, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 1029 (2006); *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243 (2000).  
3.3. A material change in circumstances can include changes in a parent’s living situation, a child’s developmental needs, and the logistics of existing visitation arrangements. See *Bukow v. Bukow*, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 833 (2002); *Schuler v. Schuler*, 382 Mass. 366 (1981).  
3.4. Courts have recognized that as children grow older, custody arrangements may need to evolve to accommodate the child’s changing developmental, educational, and emotional needs. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
3.5. Stability and meaningful relationships with both parents are critical components of a child’s best interests. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262 (2001); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  
3.6. The evidence presented here demonstrates that the living arrangements and developmental needs of Ethan Thompson have materially changed, justifying a modification under Massachusetts law.  

**4. Request for Modification**  
4.1. Plaintiff requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to better suit the minor child’s evolving needs, including but not limited to:  
   a. Granting Defendant regular overnight parenting time, to allow for longer, less disruptive visitation.  
   b. Establishing a custody schedule that better accommodates the child’s school commitments and age-appropriate routines, including consistency with homework, bedtime, and extracurricular activities.  
   c. Reducing the frequency of back-and-forth exchanges on school nights to limit stress on the child.  

**5. Relief Requested**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
   5.1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the May 15, 2019 custody order;  
   5.2. Modify the current custody and visitation order to include regular overnight parenting time for the Defendant, consistent with Ethan Thompson’s age, school schedule, and developmental needs; and  
   5.3. Grant any such further relief as this Court deems fair and just.  

Respectfully Submitted,
