**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  
DOCKET NO.: 17W-12345  

**Jennifer Smith,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, in accordance with G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 28A, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the custody and parenting time order regarding the minor child, Emma Smith, issued by this Court on May 15, 2017. Plaintiff alleges that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that warrants a modification of the current custodial arrangement to serve the best interests of the minor child.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

1. **Parties.** The Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, resides at [street address withheld], Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The Defendant, Michael Smith, resides at [street address withheld], Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The parties are the parents of one minor child, Emma Smith, born on [date of birth withheld], now ten (10) years of age.  

2. **Original Custody Order.** This Honorable Court issued the original custody and parenting time order on May 15, 2017. The order granted primary physical custody of Emma Smith to the Defendant, Michael Smith, with the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, having parenting time limited to alternating weekends (Friday after school to Sunday at 5 PM) and one weeknight dinner visitation each week.  

3. **Circumstances at the Time of Original Order.** When the parties were originally before the Court, the Plaintiff was completing graduate school, residing in a small studio apartment, and unable to maintain full-time employment due to her academic obligations and limited flexibility. At that time, the parenting schedule was designed to accommodate Plaintiff’s constraints.

4. **Substantial and Material Changes in Circumstances.** Since the entry of the original order, the Plaintiff’s circumstances have undergone a significant and material change:  
   a. Plaintiff has completed graduate school and is now employed full-time in a stable position with regular hours.  
   b. Plaintiff resides in a two-bedroom apartment in Middlesex County, which provides room for Emma to have her own dedicated bedroom when staying over at Plaintiff's home.  
   c. Plaintiff has developed a strong bond with Emma, as corroborated by the recommendations of Emma’s licensed therapist. Emma has expressed difficulty with the limited contact schedule, reporting feelings of guilt and sadness when visits with Plaintiff end prematurely.  

5. **Child’s Therapist and Best Interests.** Emma has been in therapy to address some of her emotional struggles related to the current parenting arrangement. The therapist reports that Emma has a strong desire to spend increased time with Plaintiff and that doing so would serve her best interests. Additionally, Emma has written a letter addressed to this Honorable Court expressing her preference to have more overnights at Plaintiff’s home.

6. **Defendant’s Refusal to Cooperate.** Despite repeated efforts to discuss the matter amicably with Defendant, he refuses to engage in constructive dialogue or consider alterations to the parenting arrangement. Defendant’s refusal leaves Plaintiff with no other recourse but to seek the Court’s intervention.

7. **Best Interests of the Child Standard.** Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and the established caselaw articulated in Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration in all custody and parenting time matters. Here, the material changes in the Plaintiff’s circumstances and the child’s expressed needs and preferences necessitate a modification to advance Emma’s best interests.  

**REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court issue an order modifying the existing custody and parenting time arrangement as follows:  

1. **Shared Physical Custody.** That the parties share physical custody of Emma, with Plaintiff having additional overnight parenting time to be determined by the Court.  

2. **Updated Parenting Schedule.** That the Court establish a parenting schedule that allows for Emma to stay overnight with Plaintiff at least half of the time, including alternating weeks, school vacations, and holidays.  

3. **Additional Orders in the Best Interest of the Minor Child.** That this Court issue any and all additional orders or modifications necessary to serve the best interests of the child.  

**LEGAL BASES SUPPORTING MODIFICATION**  

The Plaintiff submits that modification of the custody order is appropriate due to the material change in circumstances and the best interests of the child. Plaintiff relies on the following statutes and caselaw as legal bases for this request:  

1. **Statutory Authority and Best Interests Standard:** G.L. c. 208, § 28 (establishing best interests of the child as the controlling principle in custody cases).  
2. **Material Change Doctrine:** Custody orders may be modified upon material changes in circumstances. _See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)_.  
3. **Child’s Preference and Well-Being:** Courts may consider the child’s preference where appropriate for evaluating best interests. _See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998)_.  
4. **Improved Capacity of Plaintiff:** Significant improvement in a parent’s circumstances can justify a modification. _See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996)_.  
5. **Parent-Child Bond:** A strong and continuing bond between a parent and child is relevant to custody determinations. _See Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)_.  
6. **Therapist Recommendations:** Consideration of professional evaluations concerning the child’s needs is critical, _Whelan v. Whelan, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 616 (2009)_.  
7. **Stability and Environment:** A stable home environment supports a parent’s request for increased custody. _See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)_.  
8. **Parental Participation:** Both parents should be involved in the upbringing of the child unless it is contrary to the child's welfare. _See Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)._  
9. **Judicial Discretion to Modify Orders:** Courts retain considerable discretion in modifying custody arrangements for the child’s best interests. _See Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010)._  
10. **General Welfare of the Child:** Custody and parenting time decisions must promote a child’s welfare. _See Comerford v. Comerford, 375 Mass. 569 (1978)_.  

**CONCLUSION**  

Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court grant a modification of the custody and parenting time order entered on May 15, 2017, and issue an updated order reflecting the child’s current needs and best interests.  

Respectfully submitted,
