**LINDA SMITH**,  
**Defendant.**  

CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is an action brought by the Plaintiff, Jordan Harris, against Defendant, Linda Smith, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.

2. Plaintiff Jordan Harris is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, 02119, where Plaintiff has rented a basement-level apartment (the “Premises”) from the Defendant since March 1, 2022.  

3. Defendant Linda Smith is the owner and landlord of the Premises located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts.

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as this action relates to violations of laws governing residential tenancies in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the property in question is located in Roxbury, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Court.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff began renting the Premises from Defendant on March 1, 2022, under a month-to-month tenancy. Plaintiff currently pays $1,200 per month in rent.  

7. In mid-November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water seeping into the Premises through the basement wall during periods of heavy rain.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water intrusion via text message and requested that the issue be addressed. Defendant asserted that she would "look into it" but failed to take any action to remedy the problem.  

9. After weeks of inaction by Defendant, Plaintiff contacted local housing inspectors in an effort to bring the Premises into compliance with applicable housing codes.  

10. Inspectors from the City of Boston inspected the Premises and confirmed multiple code violations, including but not limited to water intrusion.  

11. Massachusetts housing codes require landlords to maintain rental premises in a safe, habitable, and sanitary condition. See 105 CMR 410.020 et seq.  

12. The water intrusion caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, resulting in approximately $400 in losses.  

13. In addition, Plaintiff has incurred increased electricity costs due to the need to run a dehumidifier constantly to mitigate the effects of the water intrusion.  

14. Defendant has taken no meaningful steps to address the water intrusion or rectify the conditions on the Premises, leaving Plaintiff to endure unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.  

15. Shortly after Plaintiff contacted housing inspectors, Defendant informed Plaintiff that she would not be renewing Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026, citing a single late rent payment as justification.  

16. Plaintiff contends that the decision not to renew the lease constitutes retaliation in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 18, given its proximity in time to Plaintiff’s engagement with housing inspectors.  

17. Defendant’s actions constitute a repeated and ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment as guaranteed under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

---

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION - Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

18. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, landlords are required to refrain from any actions or inactions that interfere with a tenant's right to quiet enjoyment of their rented premises.  

20. Defendant's failure to address the water intrusion constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s lawful use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

21. Defendant's retaliatory refusal to renew Plaintiff’s lease further interferes with Plaintiff’s ability to quietly and securely enjoy the Property.  

22. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff to endure unsafe living conditions, property damage, and emotional distress, all in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

23. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:  

A. Enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor against Defendant;  
B. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $400 for damaged property and any additional damages determined by the Court or jury;

D. Order Defendant to abate all housing code violations, including the water intrusion;  
E. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14; and
