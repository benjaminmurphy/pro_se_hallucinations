Docket No. _____________________  

**Emily Johnson, Plaintiff**  
v.  
**Michael Smith, Defendant**  

**Complaint for Modification of Custody Order**  

**Now Comes the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the custody order entered on March 15, 2018, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, in the best interests of the minor child, Liam Smith. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

### **1. Parties**  

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, resides at [Plaintiff's Address], within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is the mother of Liam Smith, born on [Child’s Birthdate], and currently has primary physical custody per the March 15, 2018 order.  
   
2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, resides at [Defendant's Address], also within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. He is the father of Liam Smith and currently exercises parenting time pursuant to the March 15, 2018 order, which grants him three short visits on school nights and Sunday afternoons, without overnights.  

---

### **2. Jurisdiction and Venue**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), codified at G.L. c. 209B, because Liam Smith resides in Massachusetts and has continuously resided here for more than six months immediately preceding this action.  

4. Venue is appropriate in this Court as both parties reside within Middlesex County, and the original custody order was issued here.  

---

### **3. Factual Allegations**  

5. The previous custody order, dated March 15, 2018, granted the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, primary physical custody of Liam Smith, with the Defendant, Michael Smith, receiving parenting time of three short visits during the week and Sunday afternoons, without overnights.  

6. At the time the order was entered, it was appropriate and in Liam’s best interests because he was three years old, and his father did not have suitable living conditions for overnights, residing in a shared apartment without a private space for the child.  

7. Since the entry of the original order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances justifying a modification:  

   a. The Defendant now has stable housing, having moved into his own apartment, where the minor child has his own private bedroom.  
   
   b. The minor child, now eight years old and in school full-time, has expressed a desire to spend quality overnight time with his father, which the current arrangement does not allow.  
   
   c. The minor child's current schedule, which requires frequent mid-week transportation between the parties' homes for short visits, is no longer developmentally appropriate. It disrupts his homework, bedtime routines, and overall well-being.  
   
   d. Both parties recognize that the current parenting schedule is no longer practical or beneficial to the child, and both agree that modification is necessary to better suit his current developmental and educational needs.  

---

### **4. Legal Basis for Modification**  

8. A modification of custody or parenting time orders in Massachusetts is warranted when a material and substantial change in circumstances occurs, such that the modification is in the child’s best interests. G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 31; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 736 (1996).  

9. The best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in custody arrangements, as outlined in G.L. c. 208, § 31 and reinforced in Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).  

10. The material and substantial changes in circumstances in this case (the child’s advancement to school age, the father’s improved housing conditions, and the child’s expressed need for a revised schedule) meet the threshold for modification. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998).  

11. Furthermore, it has been established that continuity, stability, and the child’s emotional and developmental needs must guide schedule revisions. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 841 (2003).  

12. Massachusetts courts recognize that school-aged children require developmentally appropriate custody and visitation schedules conducive to their education, sleep routines, and emotional needs. See Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 868 (2006).  

13. Both parties' willingness to agree to modifications is consistent with principles favoring cooperative parenting arrangements. See Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736; Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006).

### **5. Request for Relief**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court:  

1. Modify the custody and parenting schedule established in the March 15, 2018 order to provide for overnights and fewer transitions during the school week, consistent with the child’s best interests.  
   
2. Grant the Defendant, Michael Smith, overnight visits and a parenting schedule that reflects his current ability to provide appropriate overnight accommodations and the minor child's school schedule and developmental needs.  

3. Issue such further orders, findings, or relief as may be just and appropriate under the circumstances.
