**Civil Action No. ___________**

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, against the Defendant, Somerville Grocery Store, Inc., to recover damages for personal injuries and monetary losses arising from the Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain safe conditions on its premises, which caused the Plaintiff to slip and fall in the dairy aisle of its grocery store, located at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts, on September 16, 2023.

**PARTIES**  
1. The Plaintiff, Emily Carter, resides at [plaintiff’s current address], Somerville, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Somerville Grocery Store, Inc., is a corporation organized under Massachusetts law with its principal office at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts. Defendant owns, operates, and manages the grocery store located at the aforementioned address.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the matter in controversy does not exceed $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the Defendant’s grocery store where the incident occurred is located within this Court’s jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On September 16, 2023, at approximately 2:30 p.m., the Plaintiff was shopping in the dairy aisle of the Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts.  
6. While walking down the dairy aisle, the Plaintiff stepped into a large puddle of spilled milk, which caused her to slip and fall onto the ground. The fall resulted in a serious hip sprain, requiring medical attention and physical therapy.  
7. The puddle of spilled milk was clearly visible and showed signs of having been present for some time, evidenced by visible shopping cart tracks running through the liquid.  
8. No warning cones, signs, or barricades were placed near the puddle to alert customers to the hazardous condition.  
9. A store employee located approximately fifteen (15) feet away from the spill admitted to the Plaintiff after the fall that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but had not taken immediate action to clean it up or warn customers.  
10. After the fall, the Plaintiff continued shopping, thinking she was uninjured, but began experiencing significant pain later that evening.  
11. The Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an urgent care clinic the following day, was diagnosed with a hip sprain, and was prescribed physical therapy.  
12. As a result of her injuries, the Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $800 in wages due to missed shifts at her job as a barista.

**FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION** — NEGLIGENCE  

13. The Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference all of the foregoing paragraphs.  
14. Under Massachusetts law, owners and operators of businesses owe a duty of care to lawful visitors on their premises, including a duty to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition and to remedy or warn of known hazards. *Schwartz v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc.*, 102 Mass. App. Ct. 1056 (2022).  
15. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly clean the spilled milk in the dairy aisle or warn customers of its presence despite knowledge of the hazard, as admitted by its employee.  
16. The Defendant had actual notice of the hazardous condition, as the employee explicitly stated he had observed the spill but made the conscious decision to delay addressing it. *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 785 (2007).  
17. The Defendant also had constructive notice of the hazard, given that the puddle had existed for a sufficient duration to have cart tracks running through it. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  
18. The Plaintiff’s injuries were a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining its premises in a safe condition. This breach of duty resulted in foreseeable harm, as customers like the Plaintiff could reasonably be expected to traverse the dairy aisle. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 377 (2010).  
19. The Defendant’s negligence was the sole and proximate cause of the Plaintiff’s injuries, as the hazard created by the spilled milk would not have injured the Plaintiff absent the Defendant’s failure to act. *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995).  

**DAMAGES**  

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff suffered the following damages:  
   a. Physical pain and emotional distress associated with a diagnosed hip sprain;  
   b. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200 incurred in diagnosing and treating her injury, including physical therapy;  
   c. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $800 due to the inability to perform her job while recovering; and  
   d. Other general damages for pain and suffering.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against the Defendant, Somerville Grocery Store, Inc., as follows:  
1. For compensatory damages in an amount to fully compensate the Plaintiff for her medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, in an amount to be determined at trial;  
2. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;  
3. For costs incurred in bringing this action; and  
4. For such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
The Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.  

Respectfully submitted,
