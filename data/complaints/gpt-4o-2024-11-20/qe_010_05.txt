**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**LESSER DISTRICT COURT OF LOWELL**  
______________________________    
  
**JESSICA TURNER**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARIA JOHNSON**  
Defendant.  
______________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**1. PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852. Plaintiff has rented the subject property from Defendant since June 1, 2021.  

2. Defendant Maria Johnson (“Defendant”) is an individual who owns and operates the residential property located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852. Defendant resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and manages her property as a landlord.  

**2. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as this is a civil action seeking relief in an amount not exceeding $7,000.  

4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 and 3, as the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the property at issue is located in this jurisdiction.

**3. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the residential property located at 81 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852 (the “Property”), where Plaintiff continues to reside as a tenant-at-will.  

6. Plaintiff pays Defendant $1,200 per month in rent pursuant to the rental agreement.  

7. The bathroom in the Property contains no windows and is dependent on an exhaust fan for ventilation.  

8. In or around September 2025, mold began to visibly grow in the corner of the shower and spread to the ceiling.  

9. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the mold issue and requested that Defendant address it.  

10. Defendant visited the Property, observed the mold, and blamed Plaintiff, asserting that Plaintiff caused the mold by taking showers that were “too hot and too long” and by failing to use the exhaust fan every time.  

11. Plaintiff has used the exhaust fan regularly while showering, though it is not always in use, and Plaintiff’s habits are consistent with those of an average reasonable tenant.  

12. Defendant has refused to take adequate corrective action to resolve the mold issue other than offering to “clean” the existing mold, while neglecting to address the underlying cause, including the deficiencies in ventilation.  

13. The persistent presence of mold in the bathroom has caused Plaintiff to experience respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing.  

14. Plaintiff’s medical provider has attributed these symptoms to exposure to mold and has recommended that the mold be fully remediated.  

15. As a result of the mold contamination, Plaintiff was forced to dispose of her shower curtain and towels, incurring property damage of approximately sixty dollars ($60.00).  

16. Plaintiff continues to endure significant inconvenience and diminished quality of life due to the presence of mold in her home.  

**4. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

17. Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, requiring landlords to ensure that tenants can peacefully enjoy the leased premises free from substantial interference.  

19. A landlord’s failure to remedy unsafe or unsanitary conditions that render a property unfit for human habitation constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

20. Defendant has failed to maintain the Property in a condition fit for occupancy by allowing dangerous mold to persist in the bathroom and refusing to remedy the underlying ventilation issues contributing to the mold growth.  

21. The mold infestation and Defendant’s refusal to address it adequately have interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to fully use and enjoy her home and have caused ongoing physical harm, property damage, and emotional distress.  

22. Defendant’s actions and inactions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

23. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that landlords cannot disclaim responsibility for conditions caused by structural or maintenance issues, regardless of tenant habits. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994); *Jablonski v. Clemons*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 (2004).  

24. The presence of mold and Defendant’s refusal to undertake adequate remediation violate Massachusetts housing laws and guidance under *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 872 (1991), which established landlord liability for unsafe conditions impairing habitability.  

25. *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 200 (1973), makes clear that landlords are strictly liable for violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment resulting from defective conditions within their control.  

26. Defendant’s actions have further violated the state sanitary code, 105 C.M.R. 410.020 and 410.500, and applicable landlord-tenant laws. See *Younan v. Avery Dennison Corp.*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 145, 152 (2000) (recognizing unfitness for habitation as actionable).  

**5. DAMAGES**  

27. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Loss of personal property valued at sixty dollars ($60.00);  
   b. Respiratory health issues and medical concerns attributable to mold exposure;  
   c. Emotional distress and diminished enjoyment and use of her home.  

28. Plaintiff seeks compensation for these damages and requests an abatement of rent in the amount of six hundred dollars ($600.00) to reflect the diminished value of the rental premises.  

**6. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:  

1. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of six hundred dollars ($600.00), plus interest and costs, to compensate for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

2. Such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  

Respectfully submitted,
