**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, and files this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, seeking to modify the Judgment for Custody entered by this Court on May 15, 2021. The Plaintiff alleges that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred which directly impacts the welfare of the parties’ minor children, Emily Richards (age 8) and Jacob Richards (age 6). The modification requested is necessary to protect the health, safety, and best interests of the children.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, resides at [ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY] and is the mother of the minor children, Emily Richards and Jacob Richards.  
2. The Defendant, Mark Richards, resides at [ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY] and is the father of the minor children.  
3. The Court entered an order on May 15, 2021, granting primary physical custody of the minor children to the Plaintiff, with parenting time to the Defendant on alternating weekends and one midweek visit per week.  
4. At the time of the original order, neither parent was engaged in a serious relationship with a new partner, and thus the issue of third-party exposure was not addressed in the custody judgment.  
5. Since the entry of the prior custody order, the Defendant has entered into a cohabitating relationship with [NEW PARTNER’S NAME] who resides in the household during the Defendant's parenting time.  
6. Upon information and belief, [NEW PARTNER’S NAME] has a criminal record, including a conviction for assault and battery. [NEW PARTNER’S NAME] was also the subject of a prior restraining order obtained by a former girlfriend, further demonstrating a history of violent behavior or domestic disturbances.  
7. The Defendant has allowed [NEW PARTNER’S NAME] to be present during his parenting time with the minor children, thereby exposing them to potential harm.  
8. On or around [DATE], the children reported to the Plaintiff that [NEW PARTNER’S NAME] yelled at them, slammed doors, and grabbed one child with sufficient force to leave a red mark on their arm, which was visible to the Plaintiff.  
9. On another occasion, a neighbor of the Defendant contacted law enforcement during a loud argument between the Defendant and [NEW PARTNER’S NAME] that occurred while the children were present.  
10. The Plaintiff reasonably fears for the safety and well-being of Emily and Jacob while they are in the vicinity of [NEW PARTNER'S NAME] during the Defendant's parenting time.  
11. The Defendant has failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the risk of harm and has continued to permit [NEW PARTNER'S NAME] to be present during his visitation.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

12. The Court has authority to modify custody orders under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, based on a material and substantial change in circumstances and the best interests of the child.   
13. The material and substantial changes in circumstances in this case include: (a) the Defendant's cohabitation with an individual with a history of violent behavior, including a prior conviction of assault and battery; (b) the exposure of the minor children to concerning and unsafe behavior, including yelling, rough physical contact, and police involvement; and (c) the risk these circumstances pose to the minor children’s physical and emotional well-being.  
14. Massachusetts courts have long held that the child's best interests are the "paramount concern of custody proceedings." See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 841 (2003). Courts may alter custody arrangements to protect children from unsafe environments. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  

15. A change in custody orders is warranted when evidence demonstrates that a new arrangement would better serve the children’s safety and welfare. *Hunter v. Hunter*, 397 Mass. 189, 192–93 (1986); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985). When a parent's living arrangement exposes children to a pattern of violence or conflict, courts are obligated to act in the children’s best interests. See *Raymond v. Raymond*, 165 Mass. 150 (1896).  

16. Massachusetts statutes emphasize that a parent’s responsibility includes assessing and mitigating risks posed by third parties, as recognized in *Guardianship of V.V.*, 470 Mass. 590, 594 (2015). When third-party behavior endangers minor children, it constitutes a material change in circumstances justifying court intervention under G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

17. Courts must prioritize a child’s physical and emotional safety over parental visitation rights. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 599 (1996) ("The paramount obligation of the court is to protect the child."); *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649, 656 (2002).  

18. The Plaintiff has demonstrated clear and compelling evidence of a material and substantial change in circumstances necessitating a modification to the current custody arrangement.

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Prohibit [NEW PARTNER'S NAME] from being present during the Defendant’s parenting time with the minor children;  
2. In the alternative, require that the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by an independent, neutral third-party approved by this Court;  
3. Award the Plaintiff such further relief as this Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.  

Respectfully submitted,  
this 1st day of December, 2025.
