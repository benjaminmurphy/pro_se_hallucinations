CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

**COMPLAINT**  
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

**INTRODUCTION**

1. Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell, brings this complaint against the Defendant, Samantha Baker, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as guaranteed under Massachusetts law, specifically Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186 § 14. This action arises from Defendant’s failure to adequately address habitability issues in Plaintiff's rental unit, including persistent water intrusion and mold risk, causing Plaintiff damages and violating Plaintiff’s legally protected right to quiet enjoyment of their rented premises.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

**PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff, Jordan Mitchell, is an individual residing at 24-26 Elm Street, Roxbury, MA 02119 (the "Premises"), which is a basement unit rented from Defendant.  

3. Defendant, Samantha Baker, is the owner and landlord of the Premises and resides or conducts business within the jurisdiction of this Court. At all relevant times, Defendant acted as Plaintiff’s landlord for the rental property.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186 § 14 and other applicable landlord-tenant statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the Premises are located in Roxbury, Massachusetts, within the geographic jurisdiction of this Court.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the Premises for a term of one year, with the lease subsequently renewing on a month-to-month basis after expiration. The monthly rent is $1,200.  

7. Plaintiff has resided continuously in the Premises since March 1, 2022, and has paid rent to Defendant in accordance with the lease terms, except for a brief delay in October 2025 due to unforeseen medical expenses. Plaintiff paid the late rent, including any associated late fees, in full.  

8. In or around November 2025, Plaintiff began to observe water seeping through the basement walls of the Premises during periods of heavy rain.  

9. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the water intrusion via text message, and Defendant responded by stating that she would “look into it.”  

10. Despite Plaintiff notifying Defendant, no remedial action was taken. The water intrusion persisted, causing damage to Plaintiff's personal property, including a rug and bookshelf totaling approximately $400, and requiring Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier continuously to mitigate conditions conducive to mold growth. The increased electrical usage has added to Plaintiff's utility costs.  

11. Frustrated by Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff filed a complaint with municipal authorities, resulting in an inspection of the Premises. The inspection identified the water intrusion issue and other code violations.  

12. Defendant, in retaliation for Plaintiff’s exercise of their right to report habitability concerns, has declared Plaintiff a “problem tenant” and stated her intent not to renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026.  

13. As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to repair the water intrusion problem, leaving Plaintiff unable to fully enjoy the use of the Premises.  

14. Defendant’s conduct has resulted in substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises and has caused Plaintiff monetary and non-monetary damages.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186 § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186 § 14, provides that any landlord or person acting on behalf of a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant's quiet enjoyment of the leased premises is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.  

17. A landlord’s failure to address water intrusion and maintain premises in compliance with the state sanitary code constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Dartmouth v. Greater Boston Real Estate Bd.*, 407 Mass. 279 (1990).  

18. Defendant’s failure to remedy the persistent water intrusion at the Premises interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the property and created unsafe and unsanitary living conditions in violation of the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR § 410.000). See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991).  

19. Defendant’s inaction and subsequent retaliation following Plaintiff’s lawful exercise of their right to seek municipal inspection further constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages of no less than $400 related to property damage, increased electricity expenses, and the loss of their peaceful enjoyment of the Premises.

A. A finding that Defendant violated Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186 § 14, by breaching Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment;
