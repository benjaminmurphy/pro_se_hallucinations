_______________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  
(Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and Related Authorities)  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, respectfully requesting that this Honorable Court modify the current custody order entered on April 15, 2022. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states the following:**  

---

### **I. PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, at [Address on File with the Court]. Plaintiff is the biological parent of Emily Smith, 10, and Jacob Smith, 7.  
   
2. **Defendant, David Smith**, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, at [Address on File with the Court]. Defendant is the biological parent of Emily Smith, 10, and Jacob Smith, 7.  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this modification action pursuant to G.L. c. 209B, § 2 as the children reside in Massachusetts and the original custody order was issued by this Court.  

4. Venue is proper in Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28A because both parties reside in Bristol County, and the present action concerns the interests of the minor children who reside in the Commonwealth.  

---

### **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

5. Plaintiff and Defendant were previously involved in proceedings before this Honorable Court resulting in a custody order entered on April 15, 2022 (the "Current Order").  

6. The Current Order provides for shared legal custody of the two minor children, Emily (10) and Jacob (7), with Plaintiff maintaining primary physical custody and Defendant having regular parenting time.

7. The Current Order also obligates both parents to cooperate in decisions regarding the children, to refrain from disparaging one another in the presence of the children, and to promote the children’s relationships with both parents.  

8. There has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the Current Order necessitating a modification to serve the best interests of the minor children.  

9. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly **violated the cooperative decision-making provision** of the Current Order by independently enrolling the minor children in extracurricular activities that occur during Plaintiff’s scheduled parenting time without prior consultation or agreement.  

10. When conflicts arise between such activities and Plaintiff’s parenting time, Defendant has communicated to the children that their inability to attend the activities is **Plaintiff's fault**, resulting in harm to the parent-child relationship.  

11. Additionally, the minor children have informed Plaintiff of disparaging comments made by Defendant. Specifically, Defendant has described Plaintiff as "selfish" and has undermined Plaintiff’s relationship with Emily and Jacob by suggesting that Plaintiff "does not really love them."  

12. Plaintiff has observed tangible consequences of Defendant’s behavior on the emotional and physical well-being of the minor children, including **increased anxiety** and **frequent stomach aches**, particularly on transition days between the two households.  

13. Plaintiff has made diligent and reasonable efforts to communicate with Defendant and resolve these issues informally, but Defendant has failed to cooperate, necessitating Court intervention.

14. Given these developments, Plaintiff believes that substantial harm to the children may occur if the Current Order remains unchanged, and that a modification is in the **best interests of the children**.

### **IV. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION**  

15. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified upon demonstration of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a showing that modification serves the best interests of the children.  

16. Case law has consistently held that the best interests of the child are paramount in custody matters. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**.

17. The Court considers, inter alia, the emotional and developmental needs of the child, the capacity of each parent to act in the child’s best interests, and the ability of the parents to cooperate. See **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**; **Delmolino v. Nance, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 209 (1982)**.

18. Persistent violations of the terms of a custody agreement and behavior that undermines a child’s relationship with the other parent may justify modification. See **Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006)**; **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)**.

19. A pattern of conduct resulting in emotional harm to the children constitutes a material change in circumstances necessitating reconsideration of prior custody arrangements. See **Bak v. Bak, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987)**; **Anderson v. Anderson, 407 Mass. 251 (1990)**.

---

### **V. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**  

20. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

   a. Modify the Current Order to award **sole legal custody** of Emily Smith and Jacob Smith to Plaintiff;  

   b. Modify the Current Order to reflect an updated parenting time schedule that ensures stability for the children and minimizes conflict during transitions;  

   c. Establish clear provisions governing scheduling decisions for the minor children, including requiring prior written consent for enrollment in extracurricular activities that conflict with either parent’s parenting time;  

   d. Grant any other relief this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

---

### **VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the Current Order to ensure that the best interests of Emily Smith and Jacob Smith are served, and for such other relief as deemed appropriate.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Jennifer Smith**
