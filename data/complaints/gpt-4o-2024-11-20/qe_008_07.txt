**COMPLAINT**  
__________________________________________________________  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action arising from the Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a statutory and common law duty under Massachusetts law. Defendant's failure to ensure proper security for the Plaintiff's apartment building has created unsafe and unauthorized conditions that have significantly interfered with Plaintiff's right to enjoy her leased premises free from interference. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and other relief as provided by law.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease with Defendant for the residential unit located at 275 Washington Ave, Chelsea, MA 02150 (the "Apartment"). Plaintiff has continuously lived in the Apartment since that date.  

7. Plaintiff’s monthly rental obligation under the lease is $1,500, which she has consistently paid in full and in a timely manner.  

8. On or around October 1, 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the lock on the front entry door of the Property was broken, such that the door would not latch or lock properly.  

9. Defendant verbally assured Plaintiff that the lock would be repaired promptly but failed to follow through on this commitment.  

10. Plaintiff reminded Defendant on two subsequent occasions that the entryway remained unsecured, but Defendant took no action to address the issue.  

11. As a result of the broken lock, unauthorized individuals have gained entry to the Property on multiple occasions.  

12. Specifically, on or about November 1, 2025, Plaintiff’s package, valued at $120, was stolen from the common hallway of the Property. Multiple neighbors in the building also reported stolen packages.  

13. In addition to the theft, Plaintiff observed evidence that an unauthorized individual or individuals have been sleeping in the basement of the Property.  

14. Plaintiff has been forced to expend approximately $200 on security measures for her Apartment, including a security camera and a new deadbolt lock, in an effort to secure her unit against further harm.  

15. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the ongoing safety issues, but Defendant has dismissed her concerns and taken no steps to repair the broken front door lock or otherwise address the problem.  

16. The lack of security at the Property has caused Plaintiff significant distress, inconvenience, and expense, and has interfered with her ability to peacefully enjoy her Apartment.  

17. Defendant’s failure to repair the lock or otherwise address the safety issues at the Property constitutes a flagrant breach of Plaintiff’s statutory and contractual rights as a tenant.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

18. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1–17 as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, tenants are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their leased premises, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, and consistent with applicable common law principles.  

20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment ensures that a landlord may not interfere, directly or indirectly, with a tenant's use and enjoyment of their rental unit, whether through affirmative acts or omissions of necessary maintenance.  

21. A landlord’s failure to address dangerous or hazardous conditions that materially interfere with the safety and habitability of a property constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Dartmouth v. Greater New Bedford Reg'l Voc. Tech. High Sch. Dist., 461 Mass. 366 (2012)**.  

22. Defendant’s failure to repair the front entry door lock, despite being notified multiple times of the problem, has directly and significantly interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to securely enjoy her Apartment.  

23. Defendant’s failure has permitted unauthorized individuals to enter the building, resulting in theft, security breaches, and safety risks.  

24. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute deliberate neglect and violate Plaintiff’s rights under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, for which Plaintiff is entitled to damages, including attorney’s fees.  

25. Plaintiff has sustained damages as a result of Defendant’s breach, including but not limited to:  
   a. The loss of property valued at $120 (stolen package);  
   b. Personal expenses incurred to secure her Apartment (approximately $200); and  
   c. Emotional distress and inconvenience caused by the unsafe and unaddressed conditions at the Property.  

26. Plaintiff has suffered a loss of at least $320 and additional non-economic damages, and Defendant’s breach has caused repeated, ongoing harassment that undermines the quiet enjoyment of her home. See **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)**.

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

1. Damages in the amount of $320, or such other amount as allowed under Massachusetts law, for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

2. Treble damages and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

3. Injunctive relief requiring Defendant to repair the front entry door lock and address all ongoing security issues at the Property promptly.  

4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
