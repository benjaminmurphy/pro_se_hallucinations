Silva deals exclusively with the doctrine of res judicata, specifically whether prior judgments entered after sustaining demurrers bar subsequent tort actions for deceit. It does not involve landlord-tenant law, quiet enjoyment, or any issues concerning safety, security, or maintenance of locks. Therefore, it cannot be cited as authority for the claimed proposition about breach of quiet enjoyment by failure to maintain security features.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The defence of res judicata ordinarily must rest upon the fact that a judgment upon the merits had been entered in the former litigation. ... The general rule in this Commonwealth is that a judgment following the sustaining of a demurrer is not a bar to a second action for the same cause of action. It has been stated that 'The reason for the rule is that such a judgment commonly is based not on the merits but upon the insufficiency of the statement of the cause of action.'\""

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion concerns whether a statutory violation (the lead paint statute) automatically constitutes a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment and holds that it does not; it requires at least negligent conduct with notice. While the court generally notes that failures to repair known defects can violate quiet enjoyment, it does not specifically address safety/security measures like functional locks, nor does it state that such failures \"consistently\" constitute a breach. Thus, it cannot be cited as direct authority for the specific proposition about safety and security/locks.",

      "support_reasoning": "The case does address landlord duties concerning security and quiet enjoyment, and it reverses summary judgment on a quiet-enjoyment claim where a housing authority failed to take measures against criminal activity. However, the opinion does not state or imply that Massachusetts courts have \"consistently\" held that failures such as not maintaining functional locks constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment. The discussion of locks and physical security devices appears in the warranty-of-habitability section, and the court expressly distinguishes that from quiet enjoyment. Thus, the case supports the broader idea that serious security-related inaction may breach quiet enjoyment, but not the specific, \u201cconsistent\u201d rule about functional locks claimed in the proposition.",

There must be a trial to determine what, if any, measures the defendant has taken to remove nontenants engaged in unlawful activity and to determine the seriousness or substantiality of the interference with the tenancies. If the defendant has taken no action or inadequate action, despite covenanting that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to quiet enjoyment shall not be interfered with, then the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment\u2026\u201d"
