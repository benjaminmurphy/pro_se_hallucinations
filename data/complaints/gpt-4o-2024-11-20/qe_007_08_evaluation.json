It cites and incorporates prior Massachusetts cases like Westland Housing, Shindler, and Blackett, characterizing quiet enjoyment as freedom from serious interferences that impair the character and value of the leased premises.

O\u2019Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36 (1929) (quoting from Brande v. Grace, 154 Mass. 210, 212 [1891]). \u2026 Although early cases applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment required intent on the part of the landlord \u2026 more recent decisions have imposed liability whenever the \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of a landlord\u2019s action was interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights.

In explaining that some degree of landlord fault is required, the court cites and summarizes earlier decisions (Simon, Cruz, Darmetko, Dorgan, Doe) where substantial and unreasonable interferences with tenants\u2019 living conditions were found to breach quiet enjoyment. This aligns with the proposition that Massachusetts courts consistently treat substantial, unreasonable interferences as violations of the covenant.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe noted that a landlord\u2019s failure \u2018to repair defects of which he has notice in leased premises is an omission which frequently has been deemed to violate \u00a7 14.\u2019 See Cruz, supra at 789, citing Simon v. Solomon, supra at 103 (failure to control floods in tenant\u2019s apartment); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (failure to repair leaky roof); Dorgan v. Loukas, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985) (failure to bring apartment into habitable condition and keep it so). Indeed, in each case since the 1973 statutory revision in which we have recognized a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, there was evidence that the landlord failed to act reasonably in the circumstances concerning a problem known to the landlord, and the natural and probable consequences of such failure caused the interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises.\u201d"
