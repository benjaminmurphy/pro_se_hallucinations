**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action in which the Plaintiff, Alicia Thompson, seeks monetary damages and other compensatory relief against her landlord, Defendant Mark Jensen, for his failure to adequately address an electrical defect in the premises that rendered one room in Plaintiff's apartment unusable for over six weeks. This constitutes a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment as codified under Massachusetts law.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
2. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, which grants jurisdiction to the Housing Court over claims involving residential landlord-tenant relationships.

3. Venue is proper in the Springfield Division of the Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as the property at issue is located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, which falls under the geographic jurisdiction of this Court.

**PARTIES**  
4. Plaintiff Alicia Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, pursuant to a lease agreement executed on January 15, 2022. Plaintiff pays monthly rent in the amount of $1,200.  

5. Defendant Mark Jensen is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and is responsible for maintaining the premises in habitable condition.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about October 15, 2025, Plaintiff discovered that the second bedroom in her apartment had no functioning electricity. The outlets and the overhead light in the room ceased working entirely.

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue, and Defendant sent an electrician to inspect the problem. The electrician informed Plaintiff that the issue required extensive repairs due to the outdated wiring of the building.

8. Since that initial visit, Defendant has failed to undertake or complete necessary repairs to restore electricity to the second bedroom. Defendant informed Plaintiff that he was obtaining contractor quotes, but no repairs have been made.

9. As a result of the lack of electricity, Plaintiff has been unable to use the second bedroom as a home office. She has been forced to incur additional expenses, including daily expenditures of approximately $15 at coffee shops and a coworking space membership costing $150 per month.

10. Plaintiff has also had to move her office equipment into her living room, which has rendered the remainder of the apartment cramped and uncomfortable, further impairing its livability.

11. Plaintiff notified Defendant on multiple occasions that the failure to repair the issue was significantly affecting her use and enjoyment of the premises, but Defendant has taken no meaningful steps to resolve the problem in a timely manner.

12. Plaintiff has continued making monthly rent payments of $1,200, despite Defendant’s failure to provide a fully usable apartment.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

13. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law provides that a landlord may not do or fail to do any act that interferes with a tenant's use and quiet enjoyment of a leased property. A breach of this covenant entitles the tenant to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  

15. By failing to restore the electricity in the second bedroom for over six weeks, Defendant has deprived Plaintiff of her ability to use that portion of the apartment for its intended purpose.  

16. Defendant's actions and inactions constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, and case law including *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 95 (1982) (holding that landlords who fail to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with tenants' enjoyment of leased property violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment).  

17. Defendant’s failure to act in a reasonable and timely manner also violates the standard of care set forth in *Dartmouth v. Greater New Bedford Reg. Voc. Tech. Sch. Dist.*, 461 Mass. 366, 374 (2012).  

18. The unusable condition of the second bedroom constitutes a material breach that justifies compensatory damages under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, as recognized in *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715-716 (1977).

19. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, including, but not limited to:  
   a. Out-of-pocket costs for coworking spaces and alternative workspaces;  
   b. Loss of use of the second bedroom; and  
   c. Diminished enjoyment of the premises.  

20. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages, treble damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, and reasonable costs and fees.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Alicia Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

1. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but in no event less than $900;  

2. Award Plaintiff treble damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

3. Award Plaintiff her costs of litigation, including any filing fees and other costs incurred;  

4. Provide any further legal or equitable relief the Court deems appropriate and just.

Respectfully submitted,
