Instead, the court holds that the defendant was not negligent as a matter of law and affirms judgment for the defendant.

We are satisfied that, on the evidence, no such conclusion was warranted. \u2026 It follows that the defendant\u2019s failure to adopt either of those measures did not constitute negligence. \u2026 Judgment affirmed.\u201d"

It concludes there is no duty to warn of such an inherent and obvious danger, which cuts against expanding duties based on industry standards or additional safety protocols.
