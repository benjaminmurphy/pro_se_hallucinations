**Thomas Wright,**  
**Defendant.**  

CIVIL ACTION NO.: [To be assigned by the Court]  

---

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff") brings this action against Defendant Thomas Wright ("Defendant") for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a statutory and contractual obligation imposed on residential landlords under Massachusetts law.  

2. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s failure to maintain a habitable apartment and ensure adequate heat during the winter months has interfered with her right to live in the premises peacefully, free from substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of the property, as required under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14.  

**II. PARTIES**

3. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson resides at, and at all relevant times has rented, the apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  

4. Defendant Thomas Wright is Plaintiff's landlord and, upon information and belief, resides at 456 River Road, Newton, Massachusetts 02458.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 20, as Housing Court has subject matter jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes, including claims arising under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the premises at issue are located in Dorchester, within the City of Boston.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 ("the Premises").  

8. Plaintiff has lived in the Premises continuously since January 1, 2022, and has paid rent in the amount of $1,600 per month on a timely basis.  

9. The Premises include a heating system, which Defendant is obligated to repair and maintain in habitable and functional condition in accordance with the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. 410.201 and G.L. c. 111, § 127A.  

10. During the winter of 2025, on multiple occasions, the heating system in the Premises malfunctioned, resulting in indoor temperatures that dropped to as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit for hours at a time, particularly during evenings and nights.  

11. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the heating issue throughout the winter and requested repairs to restore adequate and consistent heat.  

12. While Defendant sent repair personnel on two separate occasions, the heating system’s issues persisted. Defendant’s contractor described the boiler as “old but functional” and stated there was little more that could be done to improve its performance.  

13. Defendant failed to undertake sufficient repairs or replacements to ensure reliable heating, thereby effectively allowing the heating system to remain inadequate for the duration of the winter months.  

14. Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain liveable temperatures in the Premises, which resulted in increased electricity costs of approximately $150 per month over three months.  

15. Plaintiff also contracted bronchitis in January 2025, which her physician opined was exacerbated by the insufficient heat in her home. Plaintiff incurred costs for antibiotics and lost three days’ wages due to missed work.  

16. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant has maintained that the heating system is “working” because it does not completely fail and the building is not freezing, denying Plaintiff any offer of remediation or rent adjustment.  

17. As a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has experienced significant disruptions to her enjoyment of the Premises, increased expenses, and physical hardship, in direct violation of Defendant’s statutory and contractual obligations.  

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully stated herein.  

19. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning heating system capable of providing consistent and adequate heat constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

20. Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides that any tenant whose quiet enjoyment of rented premises is interfered with by a landlord’s acts or omissions may recover actual and statutory damages, as well as attorney's fees.  

21. Defendant’s failure to repair the heating system or take reasonable measures to abate the problem forced Plaintiff to incur additional living expenses, including the costs of space heaters and increased electricity bills, in violation of the implied warranty of habitability and the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Dartmouth v. Greater New Bedford Rental Housing Corp.*, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 1108 (2007); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  

22. Defendant’s failure to ensure adequate heat also violated the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, which requires landlords to provide sufficient heating in habitable premises. See *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  

23. Defendant’s actions and inactions were willful and/or negligent. See *Simpson v. Young*, 369 Mass. 279 (1975); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  

24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover her actual damages, including increased electricity costs, medical expenses, and lost wages, as well as any statutory damages and interest available under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Thomas Wright as follows:  

1. Awarding Plaintiff her actual damages, including but not limited to $450 in increased electricity costs, $200 for medical costs, and $300 in lost wages, totaling $950.  

2. Awarding Plaintiff statutory damages and interest pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

3. Awarding Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

4. Awarding such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable, and proper.  

**VII. JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a jury trial on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

DATED: December 1, 2025
