Instead, the decision focuses on adopting the mode-of-operation doctrine and holds that the store had notice of the general, inherent risks created by its self-service operation, not actual notice of this particular spill. The proposition mischaracterizes the opinion by turning generalized notice of risk into explicit, employee-level actual notice of the hazardous condition.",

Instead, the plaintiff satisfies the notice requirement if he establishes that an injury was attributable to a reasonably foreseeable dangerous condition on the owner\u2019s premises that is related to the owner\u2019s self-service mode of operation\u2026 [T]he owner of such a self-service establishment has actual notice that his mode of operation creates certain risks of harm to his customers.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The case discusses constructive notice and the need to show that a foreign substance existed for a sufficient time to be discovered, but it ultimately finds the evidence insufficient and orders judgment for the defendant. There is no mention of cart tracks or similar indicia of duration, and the court expressly holds that the circumstantial evidence presented (including the hard, adherent substance) did not establish the required time element. Thus, the opinion does not support the proposition that constructive notice was established based on marks or tracks in a puddle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The issue presented is whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a jury to infer that the substance had been on the step long enough so that in the exercise of reasonable care the defendant should have discovered and removed it... There is nothing to distinguish this case from the great majority of cases in which we have held that directed verdicts were required. The mere stickiness or adherence of the substance to the step is not such a quality as, in common knowledge, established the time element... Judgment for the defendant.\""

Papadopoulos addresses a different context: a customer slipping on ice in an outdoor parking lot, and the court\u2019s abolition of the natural/unnatural snow and ice distinction in premises liability. While the case discusses general foreseeability and reasonable care to lawful visitors, it does not speak to customers traversing particular interior store aisles or use such an example, so it does not specifically support the stated proposition.",

      "support_reasoning": "The case does not discuss spilled milk, a hazard created by the defendant, or a finding that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Instead, the Massachusetts SJC holds that Westwood owed no duty to alter the state highway and thus could not be liable in negligence at all, and it also rejects vicarious liability. This opinion therefore undermines, rather than supports, a proposition that defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries from a particular hazard.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Before liability for negligence can be imposed, there must first be a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and a breach of that duty proximately resulting in the injury... In this case, Westwood did not fail to exercise reasonable care in the use of its land, nor was there any condition on its land that created an unreasonable risk to users of Route 1A... To hold that Westwood owed the plaintiff such a duty would significantly expand the scope of a landowner or possessor\u2019s duties... This we decline to do.\""
