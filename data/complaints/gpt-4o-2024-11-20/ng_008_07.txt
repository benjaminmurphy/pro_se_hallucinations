---

### **GENERAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. On or about May 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful invitee at Defendant’s restaurant located at 123 Ocean Avenue, Quincy, Massachusetts.  
8. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition and to protect Plaintiff from foreseeable hazards.  
9. While Plaintiff was dining at Defendant’s restaurant, a server dropped a tray of water glasses in a narrow hallway leading from the dining area to the bathrooms.  
10. Although the server promptly removed the broken glass, she left water and ice on the tile floor and stated that she would “be right back with a mop.”  
11. No wet floor sign or other warning of the hazard was placed in the hallway.  
12. Approximately ten (10) minutes later, Plaintiff used the hallway to access the restroom.  
13. The floor in the hallway was still wet at that time. The water and ice had created a slippery and hazardous condition.  
14. Plaintiff saw the glistening tiles but believed the shine was due to the nature of the tile flooring, not water.  
15. Plaintiff slipped on the wet floor, fell, and suffered a significant twisting injury to her knee.  
16. Following the incident, Plaintiff overheard staff members remarking that they had been “dodging the puddle” for an extended period.  
17. As a direct and proximate result of her fall, Plaintiff sustained a sprained knee, required the use of a brace, and underwent physical therapy.  
18. Plaintiff incurred approximately $3,500 in medical expenses and suffered lost wages of approximately $1,200.  
19. Plaintiff also endured physical pain, emotional distress, and diminished enjoyment of life.  
20. Defendant’s failure to promptly clean up the hazardous condition and to take reasonable steps to warn customers of the danger constitutes grossly negligent conduct under Massachusetts law.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

21. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  
22. Defendant had a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition to protect lawful invitees, including Plaintiff, from foreseeable harm. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  
23. Defendant’s duty includes promptly addressing hazardous conditions and/or providing adequate warnings to protect invitees. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 371 (2010).

25. Defendant knew or should have known of the wet and slippery condition in the hallway, as it was created by Defendant’s own employees and had existed for a sufficient length of time to require immediate action. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 168-69 (1973).  
26. Defendant’s employees acknowledged the hazardous nature of the puddle, demonstrating constructive and actual notice of the unsafe condition. *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783 (2007).  
27. Defendant failed to act with reasonable care to resolve the hazard, constituting negligence under Massachusetts law. *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837, 844 (1987).  
28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered significant injuries, incurred monetary losses, endured pain and suffering, and experienced emotional distress.
