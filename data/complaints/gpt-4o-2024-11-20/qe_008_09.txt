Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MICHAEL THOMPSON**  
Defendant  
__________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  
(Jury Trial Not Demanded)  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Hartman against Defendant Michael Thompson for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as guaranteed under Massachusetts law, specifically Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, section 14. Plaintiff seeks damages and other relief deemed appropriate by this Court due to Defendant’s failure to repair and maintain the premises in a safe and secure condition, resulting in significant interference with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of her rental unit.

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman is an individual residing at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, where she rents an apartment from Defendant.  
2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, owns and manages rental property, including the apartment building located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred within this jurisdiction and the property at issue is located in Chelsea, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court under G.L. c. 223, §1, as both the property and the Plaintiff are located in Chelsea, and Defendant conducts business there.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment located at 45 Washington Avenue, Chelsea, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,250.  
6. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, is responsible for maintaining the common areas and ensuring the premises are secure and habitable under both the lease agreement and Massachusetts law.  
7. Approximately two months ago, Plaintiff notified Defendant that the main entry door to the building was not functioning properly because the lock did not latch, leaving the building accessible to anyone who wished to enter.  
8. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated that he would fix the problem, but after two months and multiple reminders from Plaintiff, the door lock remains unrepaired.  
9. Due to Defendant’s failure to repair the lock, unauthorized individuals have entered the building, including, on at least one occasion, someone who rifled through the residents’ mail.  
10. Plaintiff’s package, valued at approximately $120, was stolen from the hallway of the building during this time.  
11. Further, Plaintiff has observed signs that an unauthorized person has been using the basement of the building as a sleeping area, causing Plaintiff to feel unsafe in her own home.  
12. In response to Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff was forced to purchase a security camera for her front door and install a better deadbolt on her apartment door at her own expense, costing her approximately $200.  
13. Plaintiff has repeatedly raised these concerns with Defendant, who has dismissed her complaints as an “overreaction” and refused to address the issue.  
14. Defendant’s inaction has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her rental unit, caused financial hardship, and led to emotional distress, including anxiety and a loss of a sense of safety in her own home.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  
15. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 14 of this complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment. This covenant guarantees that tenants shall not be subjected to injury or substantial interference with their enjoyment of the rented premises by the landlord’s actions—or inactions.  
17. Defendant violated this covenant by failing to maintain the common areas of the building, including the defective main entry door lock, resulting in unauthorized access to the building, theft of Plaintiff’s personal property, and emotional distress.  
18. Defendant’s failure to repair the lock despite repeated notice from Plaintiff constitutes a willful and knowing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is actionable under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
19. The resulting interference with Plaintiff’s enjoyment of her apartment caused her to incur damages, including property loss, out-of-pocket costs, and emotional distress.  
20. Defendant’s conduct was in deliberate disregard of Plaintiff’s contractual and statutory rights, warranting imposition of statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Michael Thompson and award the following relief:  
a. Statutory damages of three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, totaling $3,750;  
b. Reimbursement for the value of Plaintiff’s stolen package ($120) and the costs incurred to purchase a security camera and deadbolt ($200);  
c. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as allowed by law;  
d. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and  
e. Such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff does not request a jury trial in this matter.
