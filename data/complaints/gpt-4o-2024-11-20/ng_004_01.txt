6. The Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, is a delivery worker who was delivering groceries to one of the Defendant’s tenants on February 15, 2023.  
7. On or about February 13, 2023, a snowstorm occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts, depositing a significant amount of snow on 123 Maple Street and the surrounding areas, including the sidewalks in front of the property.  
8. The Defendant, as the property owner, had a non-delegable duty under Massachusetts law to clear and maintain the sidewalk abutting her property in a reasonably safe condition.  
9. Following the storm, the Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply any salt, sand, or other materials to prevent ice buildup.  
10. Over the next two days, the narrow shoveled path melted and refroze due to fluctuating temperatures, turning into a sheet of ice.  
11. Multiple tenants of the Defendant’s property texted her to complain about the dangerous condition of the sidewalk and sent her pictures of the ice. The Defendant responded by stating that "the sun will take care of it" and took no further action.  
12. On February 15, 2023, at approximately 11:00 a.m., the Plaintiff walked on the sidewalk in front of 123 Maple Street to deliver groceries to a tenant.  
13. While walking up the sidewalk, the Plaintiff slipped on the icy path, causing her feet to slip out from under her.  
14. The Plaintiff fell backward, landing hard on her lower back, and sustained injuries as a direct result of striking the icy sidewalk.  
15. The Plaintiff subsequently required medical treatment for her lower back injury, incurring medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.   
16. The Plaintiff’s injury also caused her to miss one week of work, resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.  
17. The Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer physical pain, emotional distress, and economic losses due to the Defendant’s negligence.
