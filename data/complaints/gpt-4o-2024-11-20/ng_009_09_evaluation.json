The court reverses the prior line of cases and explicitly states that a landlord\u2019s violation of a safety statute governing common passageways may be used to establish negligence toward lawful visitors. This directly supports the proposition that Massachusetts law imposes civil liability on landlords for failure to comply with safety statutes and to act reasonably to protect tenants (and their guests) from foreseeable harm.",

If Massios violated a statutory duty concerning safe maintenance of common passageways within her control, such a violation is evidence of negligence which the jury may consider.\u2026 Therefore, violation of a safety statute constitutes evidence of negligence in any action by a person whose only relationship to the premises where the injury occurred is that of a lawful visitor.\u201d"

Thus, citing Dos Santos for a proposition about a defendant\u2019s knowledge of a latent hazard caused by an inoperable smoke detector mischaracterizes the case\u2019s subject and holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 343A thus instructs that although a duty to warn of an open and obvious danger would be superfluous because an open and obvious danger provides its own warning, a landowner is not relieved from remedying that danger where he knows or has reason to know that lawful entrants may not heed the warning for a variety of reasons, including their own failure to exercise reasonable care. \u2026 Here, Jose set up a trampoline immediately adjacent to a two-foot-deep pool \u2026 He knew that the pool warned against jumping of any kind, and he knew that the setup was dangerous\u2026.\u201d"
