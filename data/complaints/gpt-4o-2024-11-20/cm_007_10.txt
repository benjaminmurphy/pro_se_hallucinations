**Docket No. [INSERT CASE OR DOCKET NUMBER]**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

---

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, in the above-referenced matter, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of Custody Order pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, Section 28 and other applicable law, stating as follows:

---

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, resides at [INSERT ADDRESS], [CITY/TOWN], Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, John Mitchell, resides at [INSERT ADDRESS], [CITY/TOWN], Massachusetts.  

---

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

3. The Plaintiff and the Defendant are the parents of one minor child, **Emma Mitchell**, born on [INSERT CHILD’S DATE OF BIRTH], who is now twelve years old.  
4. On May 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting the Plaintiff and the Defendant joint legal custody and **shared physical custody**, with a week-on, week-off schedule.  
5. Since the time of the Court's original order, circumstances have **materially and substantially changed**, such that the current custody schedule no longer serves the best interests of the child.  

---

**MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that significantly impacts their ability to safely and independently care for the minor child during their custodial periods.  
7. The Defendant’s condition has resulted in frequent falls, difficulty moving unassisted, and physical limitations that make it unsafe for the minor child to remain in their sole care for extended periods of time.  
8. According to the Defendant's treating physician, they should not be alone with the child in situations requiring quick physical responses or near potential hazards, such as stairs.  
9. Despite these recommendations, the Defendant has continued to insist on maintaining a 50/50 custody schedule, even when their physical constraints require the child to assist with tasks such as moving the Defendant from a wheelchair to a bed or bringing necessary items to them.  
10. This situation places undue responsibility on the child and creates an unsafe and emotionally taxing environment, thereby no longer meeting **the minor child’s best interests standard**, as delineated by Massachusetts law.  
11. The Plaintiff can provide a stable and secure primary residence for the minor child, whereas the Defendant’s current condition reasonably limits their ability to provide day-to-day physical care.  
12. It is therefore necessary and in the child’s best interests for the parenting schedule to be adjusted to reflect the **significant material change in circumstances** and to ensure the minor child’s continued safety, emotional stability, and well-being.

**APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD**  

13. Under **M.G.L. c. 208, § 28**, child custody orders may be modified where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 421 N.E.2d 521 (1981).  
14. Courts have consistently recognized that the safety, stability, and emotional well-being of the child are paramount considerations in determining a child’s best interests. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 712, 481 N.E.2d 1153 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 181, 850 N.E.2d 513 (2006).  
15. When a parent’s physical impairment impacts their ability to care for a child’s daily needs and safety, modification is warranted to protect the best interests of the child. *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 841, 792 N.E.2d 635 (2003).

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** since the entry of the May 15, 2019 custody order.  
2. Find that modifying the custody arrangement is in the **best interests** of the minor child, **Emma Mitchell**.  
3. Award the Plaintiff, Sarah Mitchell, **primary physical custody** of Emma Mitchell, subject to visitation with the Defendant, John Mitchell, as appropriate for his condition and the child’s safety.  
4. Issue any other orders this Court deems just and equitable under the circumstances.
