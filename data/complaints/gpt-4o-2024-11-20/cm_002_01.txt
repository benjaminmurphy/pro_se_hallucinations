**DOCKET NO.: [Insert Docket Number]**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Reed, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Middlesex Probate and Family Court for a modification of the custody order entered on April 15, 2021, relating to the care and custody of the parties’ minor child, Emily Turner. In support of this Complaint for Modification, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff**: Samantha Reed resides at [Insert Residential Address], Massachusetts. She is the primary custodial parent of Emily Turner, born [Insert Date], now age 8.  
2. **Defendant**: Kyle Turner resides at [Insert Residential Address], Massachusetts, but has expressed his intent to relocate to New Hampshire for employment purposes.  

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. Jurisdiction and venue are proper with the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as Emily resides in Middlesex County and this Court issued the original custody order in this matter.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. An Order for custody dated April 15, 2021, currently governs the parenting schedule for the parties’ minor child.  

5. Pursuant to the original custody order, the Plaintiff, Samantha Reed, was granted primary physical custody of Emily, with the Defendant, Kyle Turner, having parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  

6. At the time of the original custody order, both parties resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the parenting schedule reflected the close proximity of the parties' residences.  

7. The Defendant now intends to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity, approximately ninety minutes away by car, thereby creating a significant material change in circumstances.

8. If the current parenting schedule remains intact, the minor child, Emily, would be subjected to lengthy drives for her midweek overnight visits with her father. Specifically, she would need to commute approximately 90 minutes each way during the school week, creating undue stress and interfering with her established after-school routines and extracurricular activities.

9. Emily has already expressed anxiety and distress at the prospect of these lengthy commutes and the disruption to her school and extracurricular obligations.

10. The current parenting schedule was crafted based on geographical proximity and the ability of both parents to provide consistent and reasonable care, which is no longer achievable given the Defendant’s relocation.

11. The Plaintiff is requesting a modification of the parenting schedule to remove the midweek overnight visit in order to reduce Emily’s weekday travel burden and to make other adjustments as necessary to accommodate the Defendant’s relocation in the child’s best interests.

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

12. The requested modification is necessary to serve the best interests of Emily Turner and is supported by G.L. c. 208, § 28, which permits modification of custody and parenting arrangements based on a material and substantial change in circumstances. Changes in parental distance and the needs of the child are recognized under Massachusetts family law as sufficient grounds for modification. See, e.g., *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001) (holding that relocation constitutes a material change in circumstances); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (highlighting the child’s best interests as paramount in custody modifications).  

13. The Plaintiff proposes the following modified parenting schedule:  
   a. The Defendant’s midweek overnight (Wednesday) be eliminated. The Plaintiff proposes instead that the Defendant have parenting time on two weekends per month, with weekends beginning on Friday after school until Sunday evening.  
   b. The Plaintiff remains flexible to discuss an alternative parenting time arrangement during school breaks or holidays to ensure the Defendant maintains a meaningful relationship with Emily.  

14. This proposed schedule will reduce unnecessary stress and disruption for Emily, ensuring that her schooling, extracurricular activities, and overall well-being are prioritized in light of the Defendant’s relocation.  

---

### **LEGAL SUPPORT FOR MODIFICATION**

15. Under Massachusetts law, a material change in circumstances is required to modify a prior custody order. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985). Here, the intended relocation of the Defendant is a substantial material change that warrants modification of the parenting schedule.  

16. The paramount consideration in custody and parenting time decisions is the best interest of the child. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006). Ensuring Emily’s consistency in schooling and minimizing unnecessary stress aligns with her best interests.  

17. In *Malone v. Malone*, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 1116 (2013), the Court emphasized the importance of minimizing disruption to a child’s routine and stability when crafting a parenting schedule. The requested modification upholds this principle by minimizing commuter-related disruptions to Emily’s school and extracurricular schedule.  

18. Massachusetts law additionally recognizes that schedules based on geographic proximity may no longer be practical when significant relocations occur. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).

19. Other authorities, including *Chancellor v. Chancellor*, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 1005 (1987) and *Heller v. Heller*, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 924 (1992), reaffirm that the rationale for crafting fair and reasonable custody arrangements may need to be revisited when circumstances materially change.  

20. The Court has discretion under G.L. c. 208, § 28, to grant modifications when the proposed plan is reasonable and in the best interests of the child, which this request fully satisfies.

### **REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the custody and parenting time order entered on April 15, 2021, to reflect the Defendant’s relocation and the best interests of Emily Turner;  
2. Eliminate the Defendant’s Wednesday overnight parenting time and adjust weekend parenting time arrangements as proposed herein or as otherwise determined by the Court to be in the best interests of Emily Turner;  
3. Establish other terms or conditions deemed necessary to protect the best interests of the minor child; and  
4. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Samantha Reed
