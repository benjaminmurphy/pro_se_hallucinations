    Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Quincy Bistro, LLC**,  
    Defendant.  
____________________________________  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. _____**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Hartman (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Her primary residence is in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant, Quincy Bistro, LLC (“Defendant”), is a limited liability corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal business location at 123 Main Street, Quincy, MA 02169. Defendant operates a restaurant at this location, open for business to the general public.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and this Court holds general jurisdiction over personal injury lawsuits arising in Norfolk County.

4. Venue is appropriate in Norfolk County Superior Court because the incident giving rise to this claim occurred in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, at Defendant’s business premises located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, MA.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On September 10, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful business invitee at Defendant’s restaurant, Quincy Bistro.

6. While traversing a hallway between the dining area and restroom, Plaintiff slipped and fell on water and ice that had accumulated on the tile floor.

7. The hazardous condition was created when a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray carrying water glasses, resulting in broken glass, water, and ice covering the tile floor.

8. Plaintiff observed the server removing the broken glass from the floor but overheard the server state that she would “be right back with a mop.” The server failed to complete the task of cleaning the water and ice and did not place any wet floor warning signs near the area of the spill.

9. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff attempted to traverse the hallway to the restroom. The hallway remained wet and slippery, and no warnings or barriers had been placed to alert Plaintiff to the hazardous condition.

10. Plaintiff, while exercising reasonable care for her own safety, slipped and fell on the wet floor, causing her to twist her knee. Plaintiff’s fall was the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition.

11. Subsequently, Plaintiff overheard Defendant’s staff members acknowledging that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time, further demonstrating Defendant’s knowledge of the hazardous condition.

12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered a sprained knee, requiring the use of a knee brace and several weeks of physical therapy. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical costs and approximately $1,200 in lost wages.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  
13. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty of reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of unsafe conditions of which it was or should have been aware.  

15. Defendant breached this duty by:  
   a. Failing to promptly clean up the water and ice from the tiled hallway floor;  
   b. Failing to place adequate and conspicuous warnings of the hazardous condition despite knowledge of its existence; and  
   c. Failing to take reasonable measures to remedy a dangerous condition within a reasonable amount of time after being made aware of it.  

16. Defendant knew or should have known of the hazardous condition, as evidence by the server’s intent to return and clean the spill and the subsequent acknowledgment by Defendant’s staff members that they were aware of the continuing condition.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered injuries, including but not limited to, a sprained knee, ongoing pain and impairment, medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress.

18. Plaintiff has incurred actual damages in the form of $2,500 in medical expenses, $1,200 in lost wages, and other non-economic damages, including pain and suffering, which Plaintiff is entitled to recover.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury, but no less than $50,000, to cover Plaintiff’s medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
2. Costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees under applicable law;  
3. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,**  

**Dated:** December 1, 2025
