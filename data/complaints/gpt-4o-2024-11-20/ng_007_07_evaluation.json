While it repeatedly refers to negligence, causation, and the standard of care in medical malpractice, it does not undertake any general discussion or clarification of the duty of care element in negligence cases. The case is thus authority on loss of chance and related causation/injury concepts in medical negligence, not on the general concept of duty of care in negligence law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cPermitting recovery for loss of chance is particularly appropriate in the area of medical negligence. Our decision today is limited to such claims. \u2026 When a physician\u2019s negligence diminishes or destroys a patient\u2019s chance of survival, the patient has suffered real injury. The patient has lost something of great value: a chance to survive, to be cured, or otherwise to achieve a more favorable medical outcome. \u2026 Thus we recognize loss of chance not as a theory of causation, but as a theory of injury.\u201d"

Pine Manor College as a whole is a leading Massachusetts case recognizing that a college has an affirmative duty to use reasonable care to protect resident students against foreseeable criminal acts on the premises. The majority opinion (not quoted here) expressly grounds liability in the college\u2019s duty, arising from the student\u2013college relationship and the college\u2019s control of the premises, to provide reasonable security. Thus, the case supports the general proposition that entities owe a duty of care to protect individuals on their premises, even though this excerpt itself discusses only proximate cause and disagrees with the majority on that issue.",

The court holds that plaintiffs seeking recovery for negligently inflicted emotional distress must prove physical harm manifested by objective symptoms, so it does not generally recognize damages for purely emotional distress arising from negligence. Thus, citing Payton as recognizing such damages without physical injury is inaccurate.",

While the court recites general negligence principles (duty, breach, proximate cause) and mentions policy considerations in defining duty, it does not emphasize or analyze foreseeability as the key factor in determining breach of duty.
