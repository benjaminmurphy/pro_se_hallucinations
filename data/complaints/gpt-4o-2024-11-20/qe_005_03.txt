***COMPLAINT***  
**(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is an action for damages arising from Defendant’s breach of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, specifically G.L. c. 186, § 14, due to Defendant’s failure to ensure that Plaintiff could peacefully occupy her leased premises without unreasonable interference from neighboring tenants also under Defendant’s control.  

2. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, costs, and other relief as allowed by law.

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff, Jessica Harmon, resides at 45 Beacon Street, Apartment 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143, and has been a lawful tenant of the premises since January 1, 2022, under a lease agreement entered into with Defendant.  

4. Defendant, Mark Sullivan, is the owner and landlord of the property located at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, and rents residential units to tenants, including Plaintiff and the upstairs tenants who have caused continuous disturbances.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the property at issue is located in Somerville, Massachusetts.  

6. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 6, because the leased premises and the Defendant’s business activities are located within this judicial district.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the second-floor apartment at 45 Beacon Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02143 (the "Premises").  

8. Plaintiff’s lease expressly provided that she is entitled to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises as guaranteed by Massachusetts law, particularly G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

9. Approximately six months ago, tenants in the third-floor apartment of the building, who are also under the tenancy and control of Defendant, began engaging in excessive and unreasonable noise, including but not limited to: stomping, playing loud music late at night, and moving furniture during nighttime hours.  

10. The incessant noise has severely disrupted Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home, resulting in significant sleep deprivation, work-related problems, and added medical costs to address sleep disturbances.  

11. Plaintiff has taken numerous proactive measures to mitigate the nuisance, including purchasing earplugs and a white noise machine, rearranging her bedroom, and repeatedly asking the third-floor tenants to reduce the noise.  

12. Despite these efforts, the excessive noise has persisted. Plaintiff has contacted Defendant multiple times—at least five or six occasions—over the past six months to complain about the disturbance and to request intervention.  

13. Defendant acknowledged one of Plaintiff’s complaints but has since failed to take adequate steps to stop or otherwise control the excessive noise caused by the upstairs tenants, stating that he "can't control how people live."  

14. Defendant has both the authority and the obligation to address the disturbance because the tenants causing the noise are also under his tenancy and control in the same building.  

15. As a direct result of Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff has suffered significant harm, including:  
   a. Severe sleep deprivation, resulting in Plaintiff falling asleep at work and receiving a written warning from her employer;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $40 per month for prescription sleep medication;  
   c. Emotional distress and reduced quality of life; and  
   d. Inability to fully enjoy the use of her apartment as required by the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

16. Defendant’s failure to remedy the noise disturbance and ensure that Plaintiff could peacefully occupy her home constitutes a breach of the statutory and common law covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteed by Massachusetts law.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, protecting tenants from substantial interference with their use and enjoyment of the premises.  

19. Defendant, as the landlord of the property and of the tenants causing the noise, had a duty to ensure that Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment was not substantially interfered with.  

20. By failing to adequately address the excessive and unreasonable noise caused by the third-floor tenants, despite repeated complaints and notice from Plaintiff, Defendant has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

21. The substantial interference caused by Defendant’s failure to act was foreseeable and avoidable, and Defendant’s inaction has caused significant harm to Plaintiff.  

22. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment entitle tenants to statutory damages, including the greater of three months’ rent or actual damages, as well as attorney’s fees and costs.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. Damages in the amount of $2,000, or such other amount as this Court deems just and proper, to compensate Plaintiff for the direct and consequential harm caused by Defendant’s violation of her right to quiet enjoyment;  

2. Statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, including three times the monthly rent of $1,800;  

3. Reimbursement of all medical expenses and other costs incurred as a result of the noise interference;  

4. Prejudgment and postjudgment interest as allowed by law;  

5. Costs of this action, including any filing fees and other necessary expenses;  

6. Any other relief that this Court deems necessary and proper to serve the interests of justice.
