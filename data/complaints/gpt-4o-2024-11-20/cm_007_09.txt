**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  
DOCKET NO. __________________  

**LISA THORNTON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL THORNTON,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and states as follows:

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, resides at [Your Address], Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emma Thornton.  

2. The Defendant, Michael Thornton, resides at [Michael’s Address, if known], Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

3. The minor child, Emma Thornton, born **[insert DOB]**, is twelve years old and currently resides primarily in Bristol County, Massachusetts, under a shared physical custody arrangement established by the original custody order referenced below.  

---

### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

4. On June 15, 2018, the Bristol Probate and Family Court issued a final judgment granting both Plaintiff and Defendant **50/50 physical custody** of their child, Emma Thornton, to be exercised on an alternating weekly schedule. At that time, both parents lived nearby and were capable of independently fulfilling their custodial responsibilities without issue.  

5. Since the entry of the 2018 custody order, significant and material changes in circumstances have occurred, warranting a modification to the existing arrangement in order to serve the best interests of the child, Emma.  

6. Specifically, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a **progressive neurological condition** that substantially impairs his physical mobility and ability to care for the minor child independently.  

7. The Defendant’s medical condition has resulted in **falls at home** and advice from his doctor recommending that he **not be left alone with the minor child in environments requiring quick physical response**, such as near stairs.  

8. Despite these medical recommendations, the Defendant has continued to insist on maintaining the existing 50/50 custody schedule, placing the child in situations that are **unsafe** given the Defendant’s current physical limitations.  

9. The Plaintiff has observed that Emma has been required to assist the Defendant with daily physical tasks, such as **helping him move from his wheelchair to bed** and retrieving items that the Defendant is unable to access on his own. Such responsibilities are developmentally inappropriate for a twelve-year-old child and negatively affect Emma’s well-being.  

10. The Plaintiff asserts that the current shared custody arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the child due to the Defendant’s **deteriorating ability to provide a safe and stable physical environment**.  

---

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**  

11. The Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the existing custody order to reflect a new arrangement in which Emma Thornton resides primarily with the Plaintiff, Lisa Thornton, while granting the Defendant parenting time consistent with his physical capabilities and Emma’s best interests.  

12. The Plaintiff believes a primary residence arrangement will:  

   a. Provide Emma with a stable and safe living environment;  
   b. Minimize Emma's exposure to inappropriate caregiving responsibilities; and  
   c. Allow the Defendant to focus on managing his medical condition while maintaining a meaningful, supportive relationship with Emma.  

13. This request is made in accordance with the statutory and common law principle that any custody modification must reflect a **material change in circumstances** and align with the **best interests of the child**, as established in *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and *Brauer v. Brauer*, 370 Mass. 512 (1976).

### **LEGAL ARGUMENT**  

14. Under Massachusetts law, courts may modify an existing custody order if there is a material change in circumstances that affects the child’s welfare (*Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006); G.L. c. 208, § 28).  

15. The deterioration of the Defendant's physical condition constitutes a **substantial and material change** in circumstances such that the current 50/50 physical custody arrangement no longer serves the child’s best interests (*Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006)).  

16. Courts emphasize that the **best interests of the child** is the guiding standard in custody cases (G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983)). Here, Emma’s best interests require a stable and safe home environment, which the Plaintiff is better positioned to provide.  

17. Massachusetts courts have consistently acknowledged the importance of ensuring that custody arrangements promote the child’s physical and emotional welfare (*Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Hershon v. Hershon*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 209 (1985)).  

18. This Court has the authority to modify custody orders where a parent’s physical or mental condition presents safety concerns for the child (*Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)).  

19. The modification requested is consistent with the principle that children should not be placed in caregiving roles for their parents, an arrangement courts have deemed inappropriate (*Guardianship of Williams*, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 135 (2013)).  

20. Failure to modify the existing custody order would place Emma in a **developmentally harmful position** and potentially expose her to unsafe situations, in direct conflict with her best interests under Massachusetts law (*Gilmore v. Gilmore*, 369 Mass. 598 (1976)).

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2018 custody order;  
2. Modify the custody order to award the Plaintiff primary physical custody of Emma Thornton, with parenting time for the Defendant as is consistent with his physical condition and Emma’s best interests;  
3. Grant such further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
