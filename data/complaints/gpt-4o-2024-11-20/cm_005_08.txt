**Emily Johnson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, residing in Bristol County, Massachusetts, who respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the custody order dated April 15, 2021, issued by this Court. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **1. Preliminary Statement**
This is an action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, to modify the existing custody order regarding the parties’ two minor children, Sophie Smith (born June 5, 2015, now aged 10) and Jacob Smith (born February 14, 2017, now aged 8). A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the prior order, which makes it in the best interests of the minor children that the custody arrangement and related provisions be modified.

---

### **2. Parties**
1. **Plaintiff, Emily Johnson,** resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the custodial parent of Sophie Smith and Jacob Smith under the current custody arrangement.
   
2. **Defendant, Michael Smith,** resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Defendant is the non-custodial parent under the existing arrangement.

---

### **3. Jurisdiction**
This Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20. The parties are residents of Massachusetts, and the children have resided in Massachusetts for their entire lives.

---

### **4. Factual Background**
1. On or about April 15, 2021, this Court entered an order awarding the parties joint legal custody of the minor children, with physical custody primarily residing with Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and a scheduled parenting time arrangement for Defendant, Michael Smith, including alternating weekends.

2. The current custody order contains provisions requiring the parties to support the children’s relationships with both parents and prohibits disparaging remarks about the other parent in the presence of the minor children.

3. Since the entry of the existing custody order, Michael Smith has repeatedly engaged in behavior that violates the terms of the current order and is detrimental to the welfare of the minor children. Specifically:
   - Defendant has unilaterally enrolled the children in extracurricular activities that regularly occur during Plaintiff’s parenting time without consultation or agreement, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to exercise her parenting time.  
   - Defendant has told the children that Plaintiff is “selfish” and “doesn’t really love them” when Plaintiff does not agree to swap weekends or accommodate the extracurricular activities unilaterally scheduled by Defendant.  
   - The children have explicitly told Plaintiff that they feel distressed by Defendant’s disparaging remarks, and one child, Jacob, has begun experiencing recurrent stomach aches on days when transitions between the parents occur.  

4. Defendant’s actions and statements constitute a material change in circumstances since the entry of the existing custody order. These behaviors undermine the Plaintiff’s relationship with the children and directly contradict the intent and spirit of the original order.

5. It is in the best interests of the minor children to modify the current custody arrangement to provide primary physical and legal custody to Plaintiff, with clear provisions on scheduling and decision-making to prevent further violations and emotional harm to the minor children.

### **5. Requested Relief**
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the custody order dated April 15, 2021, to grant Plaintiff Emily Johnson sole legal custody of the parties’ minor children, Sophie Smith and Jacob Smith.  

2. Modify the custody order to clarify the parties’ respective rights and responsibilities regarding scheduling the children’s extracurricular activities and to require mutual written consent for any activities scheduled during the other parent’s parenting time.  

3. Reaffirm that both parents shall refrain from making disparaging remarks about the other parent in the presence of the minor children, and impose a clear mechanism for enforcement should any violations occur in the future.  

4. Award such further relief as this Court deems just and proper in the interests of the minor children.

---

### **6. Legal Grounds**
This Complaint is brought pursuant to the Massachusetts General Laws and case law, including but not limited to:

3. **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)** – Reinforces that a custody modification must be grounded in a material and substantial change in circumstances.  
4. **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)** – Provides that the children’s best interests are the paramount consideration in custody determinations.  
5. **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)** – Recognizes that interference with a parent’s relationship with the children may constitute grounds for modification.  
6. **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)** – Prohibits one parent from making unilateral decisions that affect the other parent’s rights.  
7. **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)** – Reiterates the importance of children’s emotional stability in custody decisions.  
8. **Stone v. Duffy, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 803 (2021)** – Discusses the importance of the court’s role in ensuring compliance with custody orders.  
9. **Galper v. Galper, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 918 (1996)** – Highlights that disparaging a parent in front of the children may merit legal intervention.  
10. **§ 31A of the Massachusetts Parenting Act** – Promotes frequent and continuing contact with both parents, balanced by the requirement to protect the children’s emotional wellbeing.

### **7. Prayer for Relief**

1. Modify the custody order dated April 15, 2021, to award Plaintiff sole legal and physical custody of the minor children;
