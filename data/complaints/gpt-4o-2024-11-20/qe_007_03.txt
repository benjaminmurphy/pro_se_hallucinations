Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. _______**

### COMPLAINT  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Jessica Wallis, against the Defendant, Mark Thompson, arising from the Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as set forth under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14. The Plaintiff seeks damages for the Defendant's continuous interference with her right to quietly and peacefully enjoy her leased premises due to excessive, disruptive construction noise and related issues over the course of two months, in violation of applicable law.

### PARTIES  
2. The Plaintiff, Jessica Wallis, resides at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she has leased an apartment from the Defendant since May 1, 2021.  
3. The Defendant, Mark Thompson, is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Upon information and belief, Mark Thompson’s principal address is [Address of Defendant, if known].  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court as the subject property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of this Court.  

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
6. On or about May 1, 2021, the Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a rental agreement whereby the Plaintiff agreed to lease an apartment at 218 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in exchange for monthly rent of $2,300.  
7. The lease implicitly guarantees the Plaintiff’s right to the quiet use and enjoyment of the premises, as codified under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
8. Beginning in or around October 2025, the Defendant began significant renovations on the unit adjacent to the Plaintiff’s apartment.  
9. This construction has resulted in frequent disruptive noise, including but not limited to drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by construction workers during the hours of approximately 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays.  
10. The noise consistently interferes with the Plaintiff’s ability to work from home, including her ability to participate in work-related calls and concentrate on professional responsibilities.  
11. Construction-related dust has also entered the Plaintiff’s unit through the vents, creating an additional disturbance and inconvenience.  
12. While the Defendant did inform the Plaintiff of the planned construction and reduced her monthly rent by $100 for one month, this reduction does not adequately compensate for the ongoing disruption caused by the construction.  
13. The Plaintiff has repeatedly endured substantial inconvenience, loss of use and enjoyment of her dwelling, and emotional distress due to the Defendant’s actions, which are ongoing.  
14. As of the filing of this lawsuit, the construction has persisted for approximately two months and is expected to continue for at least another one to two months.  
15. The Defendant’s activities and omissions constitute a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling the Plaintiff to recover compensatory damages under Massachusetts law.  

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

16. The Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects the tenant's right to peaceful use and enjoyment of the premises without substantial interference by the landlord or their agents.  
18. The Defendant, through his active and passive conduct, has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by:  
   a. Creating continuous and unreasonable noise disturbances from construction activities adjacent to the Plaintiff’s unit;  
   b. Failing to adequately mitigate or prevent dust from entering the Plaintiff’s living space from the construction site;  
   c. Substantially disrupting the Plaintiff's ability to use and enjoy her dwelling; and  
   d. Engaging in conduct that significantly interferes with the Plaintiff’s quiet use and enjoyment of her home.  
19. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages, emotional distress damages, and attorneys’ fees.  

### DAMAGES  
20. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. Loss of use and enjoyment of the premises;  
   b. Substantial disruption of her ability to perform her work duties and enjoy her home environment; and  
   c. Emotional distress, frustration, and inconvenience.  
21. The Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the amount of $500 for the harm she has suffered to date.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
a. Award the Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $500 or another appropriate amount to be determined at trial;  
b. Award the Plaintiff costs and expenses as permitted by law;  
c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

### JURY DEMAND  
The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all matters so triable.
