The opinion expressly rejects a nonfeasance/malfeasance distinction and emphasizes that a landlord\u2019s failure to act to remedy objectionable conditions that diminish habitability can amount to constructive eviction and bar rent. This aligns with the proposition that failure to remediate conditions diminishing tenant\u2019s use constitutes breach.",

While most of the extended discussion is framed under c. 93A, the case arises out of a covenant of quiet enjoyment claim under c. 186, \u00a7 14 and confirms that punitive-style enhanced damages are available in this landlord-tenant context.
