**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**NORFOLK COUNTY**  

DOCKET NO.: [Insert Docket Number of Original Order]  

**JESSICA TURNER,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL TURNER,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, and respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on May 15, 2020, by the Norfolk Probate and Family Court. The Plaintiff contends that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original order that significantly affects the welfare of the parties' minor children, namely due to the Defendant’s erratic work schedule and resulting inability to provide appropriate care during his parenting time.  

In support of this Complaint for Modification, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

**PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Turner resides at [Insert Address], in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Turner resides at [Insert Address], in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  

---

**JURISDICTION**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, which grants the Probate and Family Court authority to modify custody and parenting orders when circumstances require.  

4. Venue is proper in this Court as both parties reside in Norfolk County and this is the Court that issued the original order.

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

5. The Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of two minor children:  
   - Liam Turner, born [Insert DOB], aged 8;  
   - Ava Turner, born [Insert DOB], aged 6 (collectively, the "Children").  

6. On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the Children and awarding the Defendant parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight.  

7. The Defendant’s parenting time arrangement was predicated on both parties working regular daytime schedules, which allowed the Defendant to fully exercise his parenting time and care for the Children without significant disruption to their routine or safety.  

8. Recently, the Defendant began working a new job with a **7 PM to 7 AM shift**, several days each week, including many days that coincide with his parenting time.  

9. Since beginning this night shift schedule, the Defendant has repeatedly failed to provide appropriate supervision for the Children during his overnight parenting time.  

10. The Defendant frequently advises the Plaintiff with little-to-no notice that he is either too exhausted after his shift to care for the Children or leaves the Children in the care of third parties, such as his roommate, who the Plaintiff does not know well.  

11. On several occasions, the Children have reported to the Plaintiff that they fall asleep on the couch while the Defendant naps after returning home from work, further highlighting his inability to meet their needs during his designated parenting time.  

12. As a result, the Children’s safety, emotional well-being, and regular routines have been significantly disrupted, causing the Plaintiff to take on additional and unanticipated caregiving duties during the Defendant’s parenting time.  

13. The circumstances surrounding the Defendant’s ability to exercise parenting time as set forth in the original order have materially and substantially changed since its entry, and this change directly affects the Children’s welfare.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody or parenting order may be modified where there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the children.  

15. Courts routinely hold that parenting schedules must accommodate the realities of a parent’s ability to adequately supervise and care for their children. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006) (the best interests of the child are paramount in determining custody and parenting times).  

16. A parent’s failure to adequately care for children during parenting time has been grounds for modification. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842 (2003).  

17. A significant change in a parent’s employment and its impact on the care of children constitutes a material change in circumstances. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710-711 (1985).  

18. Courts have long recognized that stability is critical to the welfare of children and will place constraints on parenting schedules that disrupt children’s routines or lead to unsafe supervision. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  

19. The Plaintiff seeks a modification that is narrowly tailored to allow the Defendant to maintain a meaningful relationship with the Children while ensuring their safety and consistent care. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 495 (2012) (modifications must consider stability of the children).

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an order modifying the existing custody and parenting arrangement as follows:  

1. The Defendant’s overnight parenting time shall be limited to nights when he is **not working** a 7 PM to 7 AM shift.  

2. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with at least **48 hours' notice** if he is unable to exercise his scheduled parenting time.  

3. The Defendant shall not leave the Children in the care of unrelated third parties, including his roommate, without the Plaintiff’s prior written consent.  

4. Such further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
