But footnote 7 seems to say that 'trespassers' stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

The court frames the key question as whether the landlord acted reasonably under the circumstances and finds that failure to repair a known dangerous railing, creating a foreseeable risk of harm to persons lawfully on the premises, can give rise to tort liability. This directly supports the proposition that an unreasonable failure to act in the face of a foreseeable risk violates the applicable standard of care.",

A landlord must act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk. \u2026 The question now must be whether the landlord, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the defect and repaired it within a reasonable time.\u201d"
