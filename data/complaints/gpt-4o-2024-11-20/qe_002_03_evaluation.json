It holds that Gem\u2019s failure to maintain the apartment in sanitary, watertight condition\u2014despite repeated flooding\u2014both breached the warranty of habitability and constituted an interference with quiet enjoyment under the statute. The reasoning explicitly relies on the sanitary code requirement that apartments be watertight and concludes that permitting repeated flooding that violates those standards is actionable as interference with quiet enjoyment.",

In light of our decisions holding landlords responsible for injuries resulting from breaches of sanitary code provisions, Gem\u2019s behavior was a sufficiently \u2018proximate\u2019 cause to justify the imposition of liability\u2026\n\u2026Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

Nor does it tie its holding to 105 CMR \u00a7 410.000 by name in connection with water intrusion. Thus, while it is generally supportive of claims based on unsanitary, unsafe conditions and interference with quiet enjoyment, it does not directly support the precise proposition about failure to remedy persistent water intrusion violating the State Sanitary Code.",

However, it does not address or base liability on any \"retaliation\" by the landlord for a tenant\u2019s exercise of a right to seek municipal inspection or similar governmental help. The holding is grounded in failure to take reasonable measures to remove unlawful actors, not in retaliatory conduct following a protected activity, so the proposition overstates what the case decides.",
