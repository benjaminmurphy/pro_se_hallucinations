-----------------------------------  
**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
-----------------------------------

**INTRODUCTION**

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, § 28, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the Judgment of Custody entered on May 15, 2021. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the custody order to prevent the children’s exposure to an individual with a significant history of violence and inappropriate conduct or, alternatively, to require that the Defendant’s parenting time be supervised. As grounds for this Complaint, Plaintiff states that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the minor children in this case.

This Complaint is brought to promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the parties' minor children pursuant to the policies set forth in Massachusetts family law.

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

1. Jessica Thompson (hereinafter "Plaintiff") and Michael Johnson (hereinafter "Defendant") are the parents of two minor children:  
   - Liam Johnson, born [insert DOB] (currently 8 years old), and  
   - Ava Johnson, born [insert DOB] (currently 6 years old).  

2. The original Judgment of Custody was entered on May 15, 2021, by the Norfolk Probate and Family Court. 

3. Pursuant to the 2021 custody order, the Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody of the children. The Defendant was awarded parenting time on alternating weekends and one midweek overnight visit.

4. During the 2021 custody proceedings, both parties represented that they were not engaged in any significant romantic relationships. The Court made no orders restricting either party’s romantic partners from being around the children.

5. Since the entry of the original custody order, the Defendant has moved into a shared residence with an individual whose behaviors and history pose a significant safety risk to the minor children.

6. Upon information and belief, the Defendant’s romantic partner (whose name is not currently known to the Plaintiff) has:  
   a. A criminal conviction for assault and battery;  
   b. A history of domestic violence, including a prior restraining order obtained by a former romantic partner; and  
   c. Displayed violent and aggressive behavior in the presence of the children.  

7. Among incidents that have occurred in the children’s presence:  
   a. The children have stated that this individual yells frequently, slams doors, and creates an atmosphere of fear in the home.  
   b. On one occasion, as described by Liam, this individual grabbed one of the children’s arms with such force that it left visible marks, which were observed by the Plaintiff.  
   c. The police were called to the Defendant’s residence by a neighbor during a loud altercation while the children were present.  

8. The Defendant has failed to take action to mitigate the impact of his current cohabitant’s behaviors on the well-being, emotional safety, and physical safety of the children. 

**LEGAL STANDARDS AND JUSTIFICATION FOR MODIFICATION**

9. Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, § 28, custody orders may be modified if there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order. The modification must further the best interests of the children. _Custody of Zia_, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 239 (2000). 

10. A material and substantial change has occurred due to the Defendant’s decision to expose the children to an individual with a criminal history of violence and abusive behavior. The introduction of such an individual into the children’s lives significantly jeopardizes their safety and mental health. This warrants a modification of the existing custody order. _Hunter v. Rose_, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012); _Rolde v. Rolde_, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  

11. It is well-established under Massachusetts law that the overriding consideration in modifying a custody order is the best interests of the children. _See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas_, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); _Edwards v. Edwards_, 377 Mass. 919, 921 (1979). The children’s safety, stability, and welfare are of paramount importance. _See Blixt v. Blixt_, 437 Mass. 649, 655 (2002).  

12. Where a parent allows children to be exposed to individuals who create an unsafe or inappropriate environment, the court has broad discretion to impose conditions on custody and parenting time. _Guardianship of Estelle_, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575, 577 (2007).  

13. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant's current arrangement creates both physical and emotional harm to the children. The emotional trauma of witnessing violent behavior and the risk of physical injury constitute a material change in circumstances. _See Custody of Vaughn_, 422 Mass. 590, 598 (1996).  

14. The Plaintiff’s requested modification—either restricting the involvement of this violent individual or requiring supervised visits—is in accordance with the Court’s authority to tailor custody orders so as to protect the children’s welfare. _See Ashman v. Ashman_, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 414, 419 (1973).  

15. The presence of this individual in the Defendant’s home fundamentally impacts the children’s well-being, warranting immediate intervention and adjustment of the parenting time arrangement under G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

**RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the custody order entered on May 15, 2021, to expressly prohibit the Defendant from allowing the minor children, Liam and Ava, to be in the presence of the Defendant’s current cohabitant during any parenting time.  

2. Alternatively, modify the parenting time arrangement to require that all of the Defendant’s visits with the minor children be supervised by an appropriate third party or agency at the Defendant’s expense.  

3. Grant such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
