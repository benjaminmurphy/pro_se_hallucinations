**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
WORCESTER PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
DOCKET NO. __________  

**Jennifer Collins, Plaintiff**  
v.  
**Mark Collins, Defendant**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**1. INTRODUCTION**

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, and respectfully requests that this Court modify the custody order issued on September 15, 2021, by the Worcester Probate and Family Court. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28 and c. 209C, § 20, Plaintiff seeks a modification of the custody arrangement based on a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the parties’ minor child, Ethan Collins, born February 12, 2017. Plaintiff requests that the Court impose conditions on Defendant's custodial time to ensure the child’s physical safety and emotional well-being.

**2. PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, resides at [Plaintiff’s Address] in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Mark Collins, resides at [Defendant’s Address] in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  

**3. JURISDICTION**

This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, regarding modifications of custody orders involving minor children. Venue is proper in the Worcester Probate and Family Court as this is the court that issued the original custody order on September 15, 2021.

**4. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

1. On September 15, 2021, this Court entered a shared legal custody order providing that Ethan Collins would reside primarily with Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, and spend weekends with Defendant, Mark Collins. The order was based on a finding that the parties were equally fit and able to co-parent effectively and that this arrangement was in the child’s best interests.  
   
2. Since that order was entered, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that jeopardizes the child’s safety and demonstrates the current arrangement is no longer in his best interests.  

3. Plaintiff has observed a decline in Ethan’s physical and emotional well-being after his visits with Defendant. School officials have reported that Ethan appears disheveled and excessively tired on Monday mornings, which interferes with his ability to focus and learn.  

4. In recent months, Ethan has confided in Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at Defendant’s home, which Defendant consumes and refers to in front of Ethan. Ethan has described Defendant “not being able to walk straight.” Plaintiff reasonably believes this behavior is the result of alcohol intoxication or substance abuse.  

5. A concerned neighbor, who is aware of the custody arrangement, recently shared video footage with Plaintiff of Defendant stumbling and appearing impaired while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night. This raises concerns about Defendant’s ability to safely parent Ethan, particularly when transporting him. See Massachusetts c. 90, § 24 prohibiting operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  

6. M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 asserts that the child’s well-being is paramount in all custody decisions. When circumstances materially change, such as unsafe behavior by a parent, custody must be revisited in the best interests of the minor child.  

7. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has long recognized that the “best interests of the child” is the touchstone for custody determinations and modifications. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710-711 (1985); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 259 (2001).  

8. Defendant’s behavior creates an unsafe environment and threatens Ethan’s emotional security as contemplated under *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), which emphasizes physical safety in determining fitness of parental custodial access.  

9. There is a body of Massachusetts case law underscoring a parent’s substance abuse as a material and substantial change in circumstances. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 185 (2006) (recognizing a shift in custodial arrangements as appropriate to address a child’s best interests).  

10. Plaintiff has attempted to address these concerns with Defendant but has been met with resistance and hostility. Plaintiff believes that a modification of custody, imposing conditions on Defendant's parenting time, is necessary to protect Ethan’s welfare.  

**5. RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Collins, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody order to restrict or place reasonable conditions on Defendant’s parenting time, including but not limited to supervised visitation, or terminating overnights until Defendant demonstrates a consistent ability to safely parent Ethan.  
2. Order that Defendant submit to alcohol and/or drug screenings prior to exercising parenting time, per the Court’s discretion.  
3. Order that Defendant attend an alcohol and substance abuse evaluation and comply with any treatment recommendations.  
4. Grant such other relief as the Court deems appropriate to serve the best interests of the child.  

Respectfully submitted,
