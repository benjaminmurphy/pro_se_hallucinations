It does not set out or affirm the specific, traditional invitee-duty formulation (reasonable care to keep premises safe, warn, and remedy dangers) referenced in the proposition. While the full Mounsey opinion addresses occupier duties broadly, nothing in this quoted text clearly articulates the claimed invitee duty, so this specific excerpt does not support the proposition as stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u2018licensee\u2019 rather than an \u2018invitee,\u2019 or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses a premises owner's duty to use due care to keep premises reasonably safe or warn of dangers, but it does not involve spilled milk, actual knowledge of the hazard, or a failure to clean up after such knowledge. Instead, the court holds that the evidence was insufficient to infer that the defendant knew or should have known of the unidentified substance in time to remedy it, and it orders judgment for the defendant. Thus, the case does not support the proposition that the defendant breached its duty by failing to clean up a spill despite actual knowledge of it.",

It does not discuss the timing of a defendant\u2019s response after it becomes aware of a specific, existing hazard, nor does it hold that failure to act *promptly* upon known hazards constitutes negligence. The opinion is about imputing notice from the nature of operations, not about delay in remedying a hazard once known.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Additionally, a store owner will be liable to a plaintiff injured as a result of a dangerous condition caused by a third party only if the owner could reasonably foresee that the dangerous condition could occur, resulting from the owner\u2019s chosen mode of operation, and the owner took inadequate steps to forestall resulting injuries. \u2026 [T]he trier of fact [must] determine whether the owner could reasonably foresee or anticipate that a foreseeable risk stemming from the owner\u2019s mode of operation could occur and whether the owner exercised reasonable care in maintaining the premise in a safe condition commensurate with these foreseeable risks."

The opinion is about standards for proving proximate causation and comparative fault, not about establishing that such a conclusory causal allegation is correct in this particular case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo withstand a motion for a directed verdict on the issue of proximate causation, the plaintiff need only demonstrate that there was a greater likelihood that the harm of which the plaintiff complains was due to causes for which the defendant was responsible. The plaintiff need not eliminate all possibility that the defendant's conduct was not a cause, but need only introduce evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude that it was more probable than not that the injuries were caused by the defendant's conduct.\u201d (403 Mass. at 54-55.)"
