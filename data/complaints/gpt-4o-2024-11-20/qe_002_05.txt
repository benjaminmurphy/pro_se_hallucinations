**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on or about March 1, 2022, to rent a basement unit at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, MA, for a monthly rent of $1,200.  
8. Plaintiff has at all times resided in the property as a lawful tenant and has complied substantially with the terms of the lease agreement.  
9. Beginning in or around November 2025, Plaintiff observed significant water intrusion through the basement wall of the apartment whenever it rained heavily.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue via text message. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but failed to take any action to repair the issue despite the continued water intrusion.  
11. Plaintiff subsequently contacted the City of Boston's Inspectional Services Department. An inspection revealed the water intrusion issue, as well as additional building code violations, which were documented in a report.  
12. The water intrusion caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including the destruction of a rug and a bookshelf, totaling approximately $400 in damages.  
13. Plaintiff has been forced to run a dehumidifier continuously to mitigate mold and moisture caused by the water intrusion, resulting in increased electricity costs.  
14. Defendant has since characterized Plaintiff as a "problem tenant" and informed Plaintiff that she will not renew the lease when it expires in March 2026.  
15. Defendant alleged the decision was based on a prior instance of late rent payment by Plaintiff in October 2025. However, Plaintiff’s late rent was fully paid, together with applicable late fees, in accordance with the lease terms.  
16. Plaintiff believes and alleges that Defendant’s actions were in retaliation for Plaintiff contacting city inspectors, in violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
17. Defendant’s failure to address the water intrusion has resulted in a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the apartment, constituting a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

18. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord may not willfully or negligently interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises.  
20. Defendant’s failure to repair significant water intrusion in the apartment constitutes a negligent or willful interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the property.  
21. Defendant’s retaliatory conduct, including labeling Plaintiff a “problem tenant” and notifying Plaintiff of non-renewal of their lease, further interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the property and is prohibited under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
22. As a direct result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages including property damage, increased living expenses, emotional distress, and the loss of quiet enjoyment.
