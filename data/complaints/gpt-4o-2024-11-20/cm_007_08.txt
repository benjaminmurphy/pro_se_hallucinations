### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. The original custody order, dated May 15, 2018, granted the parties joint physical custody of their minor child, Emily Thompson, under a 50/50 parenting schedule in which the parties alternated weeks.  

7. At the time of the original order, both parties resided in close proximity to one another and were in good health, allowing the alternating week schedule to function smoothly and without disruption to the child.  

8. Recently, the Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that affects his physical mobility, balance, and ability to engage in quick physical response.  

9. The Defendant’s condition has resulted in several falls and near-falls in his home. Based on the advice of the Defendant’s treating physician, he should avoid situations requiring quick physical movements or the risk of falling near the minor child—particularly near hazards such as stairs.  

10. Despite the Defendant’s limitations, he continues to insist on maintaining the original 50/50 schedule, even though his health now limits his ability to safely care for the child.  

11. On multiple occasions, the minor child, Emily, has had to assist the Defendant with tasks that are beyond her developmental and physical capacity, including helping him transfer between his wheelchair and bed and retrieving medical devices or other aids for him.  

12. These physical caregiving demands being placed on Emily are inappropriate given her age (12 years old) and pose risks to her emotional well-being and physical safety.  

13. The Plaintiff has offered alternative scheduling options to the Defendant to better suit his capabilities and to ensure the child’s safety and stability, but the Defendant has refused to agree to a modification of the parenting schedule.  

14. The Plaintiff has a stable and appropriate living environment and is capable of exercising the role of primary physical custodian for Emily while supporting Emily’s continued relationship with the Defendant on a safer and more appropriate schedule.  

15. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the existing custody order to provide for primary physical custody of Emily to rest with her, with parenting time for the Defendant adjusted to better align with his current physical capabilities and ensure Emily’s safety.

### **MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

16. A material change in circumstances has occurred warranting a modification of the existing custody order, as required under Massachusetts law.  

17. Specifically, the Defendant’s progressive neurological condition and associated physical limitations present significant new circumstances that were not present at the time of the 2018 custody order.  

18. Massachusetts courts recognize that a child’s “best interests” require consideration of the child’s physical and emotional well-being and stability. A parenting schedule that imposes caregiving responsibilities on a 12-year-old child or exposes her to safety risks is not consistent with her best interests. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Harmon v. Harmon*, 394 Mass. 223 (1985).

19. The current parenting schedule is no longer workable given the Defendant’s medical condition and creates potential harm for Emily. Massachusetts courts hold that the paramount goal in custody matters is the health, safety, and welfare of the child. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

20. Plaintiff’s requested modification is consistent with the minor child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001); *Allen v. Allen*, 86 Mass. App. Ct. 295 (2014).

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

2. Revise the parenting schedule to provide the Defendant, James Thompson, parenting time consistent with his physical capabilities, which prioritizes the safety, well-being, and best interests of the minor child.  
3. Grant such further relief as justice may require.
