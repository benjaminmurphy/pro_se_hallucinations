### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6. The Plaintiff resides in a duplex at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, sharing a driveway with the Defendant, who resides at an adjacent property at 125 Elm Street.  
7. The Defendant has long maintained a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against a wooden fence adjacent to the shared driveway.  
8. The Plaintiff had previously expressed concern to the Defendant regarding the ladder's precarious position, particularly on windy days, and requested that the Defendant secure or relocate the ladder.  
9. The Defendant acknowledged the Plaintiff’s request and indicated that he would tie the ladder down or move it; however, the Defendant failed to take any action to address the situation.  
10. On March 15, 2023, a particularly windy day, while Plaintiff was backing into the shared driveway, a gust of wind caused the ladder to fall.  
11. The ladder struck the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s car, causing significant damage, including dents to the hood and a cracked windshield.  
12. As a result of the ladder's fall and the damage to the Plaintiff's car, the Plaintiff incurred direct expenses for bodywork and windshield replacement and was further forced to rent a vehicle for transportation while his car was in the shop for over a week.  
13. The Plaintiff paid a total of $1,500.00 in out-of-pocket expenses, including his car insurance deductible and vehicle rental fees.

### IV. NEGLIGENCE  

14. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. At all relevant times, the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm in his actions and omissions regarding the condition of the shared driveway. See *Seigel v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.*, 273 Mass. 423 (1930) (illustrating duty of reasonable care on adjacent property owners).  
16. The Defendant breached his duty of care through the following negligent acts or omissions:  
   a. Failing to properly secure or relocate the ladder, despite knowing its dangerous condition and the likelihood that it could fall during windy conditions;  
   b. Maintaining the ladder in a position where it posed an unreasonable risk to persons and property in the adjacent driveway, including Plaintiff’s car;  
   c. Ignoring Plaintiff’s repeated warnings about the hazardous position of the ladder and failing to take remedial action within a reasonable time period.  
17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff suffered property damage, including a dented hood and cracked windshield, and incurred costs for vehicle repairs and rentals. See *Whittaker v. Saraceno*, 418 Mass. 196 (1994) (proximate cause established where defendant’s lack of reasonable care results in foreseeable harm).  
18. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence as defined under Massachusetts common law and statutory law. See *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991) (plaintiff may recover where defendant’s failure to address known hazardous condition results in foreseeable injury).  

### Damages  

19. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of $1,500.00, including an insurance deductible and vehicle rental fees.  
20. The Plaintiff suffered inconvenience and disruption caused by the inability to use his vehicle during the repair period.  
21. All of the damages sustained by the Plaintiff were the direct and foreseeable result of the Defendant’s negligent failure to secure or relocate the ladder.
