The court explains that \u00a7 14 was intended to expand common-law quiet-enjoyment damages and that \u201call reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic\u201d are within its scope, thereby authorizing recovery for emotional distress in this landlord-tenant context. Although the court ultimately vacates the specific $10,000 quiet-enjoyment award as duplicative, the reasoning clearly recognizes emotional distress as a proper element of damages under Massachusetts quiet enjoyment principles.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that tenants may recover \u2018actual and consequential\u2019 damages from landlords who have interfered with their quiet enjoyment of leased premises. We have noted that this provision was intended to expand the damages recoverable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment\u2026 The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages, therefore, suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery. In the present case\u2026 Solomon\u2019s claim for emotional distress was within the scope of \u00a7 14\u2026\u201d"
