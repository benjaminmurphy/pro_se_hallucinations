**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BOSTON HOUSING COURT**  
**Civil Action No. ___________**

**SARAH JOHNSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK THOMPSON,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. Plaintiff Sarah Johnson (“Plaintiff”), a residential tenant, brings this action against her landlord, Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), for violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages and all relief the Court deems just and proper based on the harm caused by Defendant's failure to adequately maintain her rental apartment in a habitable condition, resulting in interference with Plaintiff's right to use and enjoy her leased premises.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Sarah Johnson resides at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.  
3. Defendant Mark Thompson is a landlord with ownership and control over the residential property at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130. Defendant rents the property, including Plaintiff's unit, for profit.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as it involves a dispute between a residential tenant and a landlord.  
5. Venue in the Boston Housing Court is proper because the leased premises at issue are located within the Court’s territorial jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On June 1, 2022, Plaintiff began leasing a studio apartment located at 123 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 (the “Premises”), pursuant to a residential lease agreement. Plaintiff pays $1,500 per month in rent.  
7. Prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff noticed water stains on the ceiling of the unit. Upon inquiring, Defendant assured Plaintiff that the stains were from an old leak that had been “totally fixed.”  
8. During the first rainstorm after Plaintiff moved into the Premises, water began dripping from the same area on the ceiling where the stains were located. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue.  
9. Despite receiving numerous complaints from Plaintiff about the water intrusion, Defendant dismissed the issue as a “minor cosmetic issue” and failed to take any meaningful action to remedy the leak.  
10. Defendant’s failure to address the persistent water leak has caused substantial harm, including:  
   a. The water intrusion has worsened over time, soaking Plaintiff’s couch during a rainstorm and ruining her laptop, which cost $900 to replace.  
   b. The persistent moisture has caused a musty odor in the apartment.  
   c. Plaintiff has experienced headaches, which she believes are caused by mold resulting from the water damage.  
   d. Plaintiff has been forced to move her bed and live in only half of the apartment to avoid the affected area.  
11. Defendant’s inaction and refusal to repair the defect have effectively deprived Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
12. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.  
13. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease agreement, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
14. G.L. c. 186, § 14 provides, in relevant part, that any lessor or landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of their rented premises shall be liable for damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees.  
15. Defendant's actions and inactions constitute an ongoing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as Defendant’s refusal to remedy the water intrusion has substantially interfered with Plaintiff's comfortable and peaceful enjoyment of the Premises.  
16. Defendant’s breach has directly caused Plaintiff economic loss and substantial annoyance, including damage to her personal property, physical discomfort, and significant disruption to her ability to use and occupy the Premises.  
17. Defendant’s disregard for Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant and failure to address serious defects in the Premises violate Plaintiff's rights under Massachusetts law.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
A. An award of monetary damages for economic loss, including $900 for the destruction of Plaintiff’s personal property, and all damages permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14, including three months’ rent ($4,500);  
B. An award for Plaintiff’s pain, suffering, and inconvenience caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
C. An order directing Defendant to repair the defects in the Premises and to remediate any mold or other hazardous conditions that have resulted from Defendant’s inaction;  
D. An award of Plaintiff’s costs and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with bringing this action; and  
E. Such other, further, and different relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
