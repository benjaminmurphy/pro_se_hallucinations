But the court expressly holds that the separate claim that he failed to provide a safe place to work fails for lack of proof of causation, and that there was insufficient evidence that other defendants\u2019 conduct (including the manufacturer) caused the physical injury. Thus, the opinion does not generally support the broad proposition that defendants\u2019 actions and inactions were unreasonable, negligent, and a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff\u2019s physical injuries.",

Lewis \u2014 that Lewis failed to provide the decedent with a safe place to work \u2014 \u2026 The plaintiff\u2019s case is still lacking, however, because no evidence of causation was presented at trial: there was no proof that \u2018but for\u2019 this negligence the injury to LaClair would not have occurred.\u201d"
