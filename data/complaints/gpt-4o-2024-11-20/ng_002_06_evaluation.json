While the opinion clearly states that foreseeable harm to motorists from a drunk driver can create a duty and proximate cause, it does not deal with animal control or dog-related injuries. Thus it supports the broader principle that foreseeability is integral to negligence, but not specifically that a plaintiff\u2019s injuries were a foreseeable consequence of a defendant\u2019s failure to control a dog.",

The statutes which establish police responsibilities in such circumstances evidence a legislative intent to protect both intoxicated persons and other users of the highway. As to the most crucial factor \u2014 foreseeability \u2014 the calamitous consequences to the victims of accidents caused by drunken driving are all too predictable.\u201d"
