It explains that evaluating removal requires assessing how the change affects the child\u2019s quality of life, relationship with the noncustodial parent, and developmental needs, and it approves a schedule giving the father extended visits, reflecting a best-interests analysis of parenting time. Thus the case does support the general proposition that parenting arrangements should reflect the children\u2019s best interests.",

The removal discussion concerns relocation to another state under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, and the custody/visitation rulings are grounded in domestic violence and the child\u2019s best interests, not employment schedule changes.

In light of the fact that more than three years have passed since the judgment was entered and the mother and the child relocated to Illinois, we conclude that a further evidentiary hearing is required to enable a judge to make a decision whether the mother\u2019s request for removal to a specific State is warranted...\u201d"
