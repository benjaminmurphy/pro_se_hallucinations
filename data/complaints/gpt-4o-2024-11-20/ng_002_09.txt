3. Defendant Tom Holland is an individual who resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was present at Oak Hill Park in Newton, MA at all times relevant to this Complaint.  

### III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, because the matter involves a claim for damages appropriately handled in a District Court and occurred in Newton, within the jurisdiction of this Court.

5. Venue is proper in Newton District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 as the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts, and both parties are residents of the Commonwealth.  

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
6. On July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was jogging on a public jogging path in Oak Hill Park, located at 123 Oak Street, Newton, MA.

7. Oak Hill Park is maintained and regulated by the City of Newton and is subject to posted park rules, including a requirement that all dogs must be kept on a leash in accordance with Newton City Ordinance § 3-38.

8. At approximately 3:30 PM, the Defendant was present at Oak Hill Park with a large dog. Despite holding a leash, the Defendant negligently permitted the dog to roam freely off the leash in violation of posted park rules and the ordinance.

9. While jogging along the path, Plaintiff observed Defendant’s dog running toward her, barking loudly and in an aggressive manner.

10. Fearing imminent harm, Plaintiff was forced to swerve off the marked jogging path to avoid the oncoming dog.

11. As Plaintiff swerved, she tripped over an exposed tree root on the unpaved area adjacent to the jogging path and fell down a small embankment.  

12. Plaintiff sustained a broken wrist as a direct result of the fall. She was transported to the ER and required medical treatment, including a wrist brace, and was forced to miss several weeks of work and personal activities, including a planned piano recital.

13. At all times, Defendant was 30 feet away conversing with friends, holding the leash in his hand or slung over his shoulder, in disregard of his duty to control the dog.

14. Other park visitors witnessed the loose dog, the Plaintiff’s fall, and Defendant’s inaction in supervising his pet.

15. Defendant’s failure to leash and properly supervise his dog, combined with his disregard of park regulations, created a foreseeable risk of injury to others, including Plaintiff.

16. Plaintiff’s injuries were the direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct.  

### V. CAUSE OF ACTION  
**COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE**  
17. Plaintiff restates and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, including compliance with all public laws and ordinances applicable to the safe use of park spaces, the proper control of pets, and the prevention of foreseeable harm to others.  

19. Defendant breached this duty by negligently allowing his dog to roam freely off-leash in violation of Newton City Ordinance § 3-38 and failing to exercise reasonable care in supervising the dog.

20. Defendant’s negligent actions were the proximate cause of Plaintiff being forced to swerve off the jogging path and suffer injuries.

21. Plaintiff has suffered physical injuries, pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500, and lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200 as a result of Defendant’s negligence.

22. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the Complaint as further damages and treatment costs become known.  

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Freeman respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  
a. Compensatory damages in the amount of $2,500 for medical expenses related to the injury;  
b. Compensatory damages in the amount of $1,200 for lost income;  
c. Damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact;  
d. Costs of this action, including attorneys’ fees, to the extent recoverable by law; and  
e. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

### VII. JURY DEMAND
