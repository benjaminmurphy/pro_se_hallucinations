He recognizes that the majority opinion adopts an implied warranty of fitness/habitability and concurs in the core result limiting rent to the reasonable value of the premises in light of code violations, so the case as a whole is authoritative for the implied warranty of habitability in Massachusetts.",

Although the separate $10,000 quiet-enjoyment verdict was vacated as duplicative, the opinion clearly recognizes emotional distress as a proper measure of damages for breach of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that tenants may recover \u2018actual and consequential\u2019 damages from landlords who have interfered with their quiet enjoyment of leased premises. \u2026 The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages, therefore, suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery. In the present case, not only were Solomon\u2019s injuries foreseeable, but the jury found specifically that Gem knew or should have known that if it permitted floods to occur, Solomon would suffer emotional harm. Therefore, Solomon\u2019s claim for emotional distress was within the scope of \u00a7 14\u2026\u201d"

The court actually narrows habitability by holding that natural accumulations of snow and ice are not the sort of defects that implicate the implied warranty of habitability at all.
