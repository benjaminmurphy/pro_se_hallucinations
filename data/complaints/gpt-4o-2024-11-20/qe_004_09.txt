**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

---

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), brings this action against her landlord, Michael Smith (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as guaranteed under Massachusetts law. The Defendant’s failure to provide habitable conditions and address a long-standing rodent infestation has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her rental unit, causing her financial loss, emotional distress, and anxiety.  

2. This Complaint seeks damages and any other relief the Court deems fair and just.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to lease an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01605, for a monthly rent of $1,200.  

8. Since approximately September 2025, Plaintiff has experienced a persistent rodent infestation in the apartment, evidenced by the regular presence of mouse droppings in the kitchen and elsewhere throughout the rental unit.  

9. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the issue, and while Defendant initially attempted minimal measures to address the infestation—such as setting traps and arranging for a single visit by an exterminator—these efforts have proven insufficient to resolve the problem.  

10. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that a more comprehensive pest control treatment of the building was necessary to eliminate the infestation. However, Defendant refused to undertake or pay for such treatment, citing its cost.  

11. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s continued reports of the issue, stating that rodent infestations are “normal for older buildings” and attributing the problem to Plaintiff rather than undertaking adequate steps to fulfill his legal obligation to maintain the habitability of the premises.  

12. As a result of Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff has been forced to discard foodstuffs contaminated by rodents, incurring approximately $200 in damages. Plaintiff has also purchased plastic containers for food storage, costing an additional $80, to mitigate the damage caused by the infestation.  

13. Plaintiff’s inability to use her kitchen without fear of contamination has caused her significant distress, emotional harm, and anxiety.  

14. Defendant’s failure to remedy the infestation has rendered the apartment unfit for its intended use as a safe and habitable residence and substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the property.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14)**  

15. The Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference all allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, where a landlord’s actions or inactions interfere substantially with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, the landlord violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

17. Defendant, as a landlord, has a duty to ensure the premises remain habitable and free from conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the rental unit.  

18. Defendant’s failure to adequately address the rodent infestation, despite Plaintiff’s repeated notice, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

19. Defendant’s conduct was intentional or, at a minimum, grossly negligent in failing to remedy the rodent infestation or take recommended comprehensive action to address the issue.  

20. Defendant’s actions and omissions in disregarding Plaintiff’s concerns and failing to uphold his obligations as a landlord constitute an egregious breach of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

21. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14 and supporting case law such as *Dartmouth v. Silva*, 325 Mass. 401 (1950), as well as *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994), Defendant’s breach entitles Plaintiff to recover actual damages, costs, and attorney’s fees.  

22. Plaintiff’s damages include, but are not limited to, $280 in concrete financial losses, emotional distress, and continued interference with her enjoyment of the premises.  

23. Defendant’s conduct also contravenes his statutory obligation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, § 127L to maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate pest infestations.  

24. The breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment also violates legal principles established in Massachusetts caselaw, including *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973) (articulating landlord obligations under the implied warranty of habitability) and *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (allowing recovery for emotional distress in such circumstances).
