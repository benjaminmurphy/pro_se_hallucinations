**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is an action for negligence arising from damage to Plaintiff’s car caused by Defendant’s failure to safely secure a tall aluminum ladder, which Defendant left leaning against a wooden fence adjacent to Plaintiff’s driveway. Despite multiple prior warnings about the likelihood of the ladder falling and causing harm, Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent such an occurrence. On or about March 15, 2023, a gust of wind knocked the ladder onto Plaintiff’s car, resulting in significant damage to the vehicle.    

2. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, seeks compensation for the costs incurred to repair her car, including her deductible and car rental expenses, as well as any further relief the Court deems proper.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Plaintiff and Defendant are neighbors who share a driveway located at 123 Elm Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  

8. For an extended period prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant stored a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning against a wooden fence near the shared driveway.  

9. Plaintiff had voiced concern to Defendant multiple times before the incident, noting that the ladder posed a risk of falling, particularly on windy days, and specifically expressed concern that it could damage her car.  

10. Defendant assured Plaintiff that he would tie down or relocate the ladder to secure it but failed to do so.  

11. On or about March 15, 2023, a particularly windy day, as Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the shared driveway, a strong gust of wind knocked the aluminum ladder over.  

12. The ladder struck Plaintiff’s car, causing a large dent on the hood and cracking the windshield.  

13. As a result of the falling ladder, Plaintiff’s car required bodywork and a replacement windshield.  

14. The damage to the vehicle rendered it unusable for several days while it was being repaired, requiring Plaintiff to rent a car at her own expense.  

15. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket damages, including payment of her insurance deductible, car rental fees, and other associated costs.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

16. Plaintiff incorporates all prior paragraphs of this Complaint as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to avoid creating hazards that foreseeably could cause harm. See **Davis v. Westwood Group**, 420 Mass. 739, 742 (1995).  

18. Defendant’s decision to store a large ladder unsecured, leaning against a wooden fence near the shared driveway, created an unreasonable risk of harm that Defendant knew or should have known posed a foreseeable danger to Plaintiff and her property. See **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (property owners owe a duty of reasonable care).  

19. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to secure the ladder despite Plaintiff’s repeated warnings about its risk of falling and causing damage. See **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148, 153 (2013) (negligence exists where a duty of reasonable care is violated).  

20. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the damages to Plaintiff’s vehicle. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006).  

21. Plaintiff’s damages, including her insurance deductible and car rental expenses, were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s failure to secure the ladder. See **Julian v. Randazzo**, 380 Mass. 391, 396 (1980).  

22. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law. See **Glidden v. Maglio**, 430 Mass. 694, 696-97 (2000).

**DAMAGES**  

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  

    a. Insurance deductible expenses for vehicle repair estimated at $1,000;  

    b. Car rental fees incurred while her car was being repaired, estimated at $450;  

    c. Other incidental expenses related to the loss of use of her vehicle.  

24. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to reflect the full amount of damages, which are ongoing.
