The court holds that Gem\u2019s reckless failure to prevent repeated flooding interfered with quiet enjoyment and was actionable under \u00a7 14, including attorneys\u2019 fees, but it does not address hot water or use that as the predicate breach. Thus, citing this case specifically for failure to address loss of hot water as an actionable \u00a7 14 breach is inaccurate, though it does generally support that serious failures to provide essential services/sanitary conditions can be actionable under \u00a7 14.",
