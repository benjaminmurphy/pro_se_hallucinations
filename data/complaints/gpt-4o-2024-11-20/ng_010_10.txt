Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MIKE THOMPSON**,  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**

**INTRODUCTION**

This is a negligence action arising out of injuries sustained by Plaintiff Jessica Hart on or about July 15, 2023. Plaintiff was injured when a large branch, known by Defendant Mike Thompson to be damaged and structurally unsound, fell from a tree on Defendant’s property at 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to address this known hazard, causing injuries and damages to Plaintiff, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.

**PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Hart ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Mike Thompson ("Defendant") is an individual who resides and owns property located at 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the underlying incident occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, within Berkshire County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully restated herein.  
6. Defendant owns and manages the property located at 45 Maple Avenue, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
7. A large maple tree is located in the front yard of Defendant’s property, near the sidewalk that runs along Maple Avenue.  
8. Prior to the incident at issue, one of the primary branches of the tree was visibly cracked and drooping.  
9. Defendant knew or should have known about the hazardous condition of this branch based on its visibly damaged condition and the concerns expressed by neighbors.  
10. Upon information and belief, neighbors had informed Defendant of the cracked branch and advised him to have it inspected or removed by an arborist.  
11. Defendant failed to act with reasonable care by neglecting to repair, remove, or otherwise mitigate the hazardous condition posed by the branch.   
12. On or about July 15, 2023, during a typical summer thunderstorm, the cracked branch detached from the maple tree and fell onto the sidewalk.  
13. At that time, Plaintiff was walking along the sidewalk and was struck by the falling branch.  
14. The force of the falling branch caused Plaintiff to suffer injuries, including a shoulder strain and extensive bruising to her body, as well as emotional distress.  
15. Plaintiff incurred significant medical expenses for diagnosis and treatment of her injuries and was unable to work for a week, resulting in lost wages.  
16. Plaintiff’s total damages include approximately $2,500 in medical expenses and $600 in lost wages, in addition to pain, suffering, and emotional distress.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully restated herein.  
18. In Massachusetts, property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors on their property or on abutting sidewalks, including a duty to avoid creating or permitting unreasonably dangerous conditions. *See Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  
19. Defendant breached his duty of reasonable care by failing to repair, remove, or otherwise address the hazardous condition of the damaged branch, despite actual and constructive notice of its unsound structure.  
20. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes a breach of the duty of care owed to Plaintiff.  
21. Defendant should have reasonably foreseen that permitting a visibly damaged and drooping branch to remain hanging over a public sidewalk created an unreasonable risk of harm to pedestrians. *See Scholl v. United States*, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 816 (2007).  
22. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. *See Mullins v. Pine Manor College*, 389 Mass. 47, 57 (1983).  
23. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and endured pain and suffering. *See Gage v. City of Westfield*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 683 (1988).  

**CAUSATION AND DAMAGES**

24. But for Defendant’s negligence in failing to address the hazardous condition of the tree branch, Plaintiff would not have sustained her injuries on July 15, 2023. *See Kent v. Commonwealth*, 437 Mass. 312, 320 (2002).  
25. Plaintiff has incurred the following damages:  

   a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $600;  
   c. Pain, suffering, and emotional distress, in an amount to be determined at trial.  

26. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were a foreseeable result of Defendant’s failure to act with reasonable care. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 377 (2010).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hart respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mike Thompson and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering, and emotional distress;  
2. Prejudgment interest as provided by law;  
3. Attorneys’ fees and costs of this action;  
4. Such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,  

**Jessica Hart**
