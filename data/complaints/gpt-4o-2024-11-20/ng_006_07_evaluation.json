Its reasoning concerns when a jury versus a judge should decide whether a driver acted with reasonable care, not whether Massachusetts courts have consistently treated failure to exercise reasonable care as actionable negligence. Thus it cannot serve as authority for the stated Massachusetts-specific proposition.",

No doubt it was his duty to look along the track from his seat, if looking would avail to warn him of the danger... A jury, but not the court, might say that with faculties thus limited, he should have found some other means of assuring himself of safety before venturing to cross.\""

The court assumes, without analysis, that the intoxicated guest\u2019s negligent driving caused the injury and focuses solely on whether the social host owed a duty. It does not articulate or reaffirm any general rule that a driver\u2019s lack of reasonable care constitutes actionable negligence, so it does not support the claimed broad proposition.",

As a result of the collision, the plaintiff suffered severe and permanent physical injuries. 1.

Instead, the court holds that, under these facts, the landowner had no duty because the risk was obvious and the plaintiff\u2019s use of the elevator was not sufficiently foreseeable to require additional precautions. The opinion is about a premises owner\u2019s duty and obvious dangers, not about a motor vehicle operator\u2019s duty to check for cyclists, and it ultimately finds no negligence despite arguments about foreseeability.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe question to be decided, then, is whether the jury reasonably could have concluded that, in view of all the circumstances, an ordinarily prudent person in the defendant\u2019s position would have taken steps, not taken by the defendant, to prevent the accident that occurred. We are satisfied that, on the evidence, no such conclusion was warranted\u2026 Thus, the jury was unwarranted in inferring that an ordinarily prudent person in the relevant circumstances would have provided a solid elevator ceiling or a printed warning\u2026 It follows that the defendant\u2019s failure to adopt either of those measures did not constitute negligence.\u201d"

The case deals with comparative negligence, allocation of fault (including whether a settling tortfeasor should be on the verdict slip), and admissibility of sprinkler\u2011system evidence.
