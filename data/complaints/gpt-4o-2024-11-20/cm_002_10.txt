    Plaintiff,  
    v.  
**DAVID BROWN**,  
    Defendant.  
_____________________________________    

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the Judgment or Order regarding custody of the minor child, Sofia Brown, entered by this Court on March 15, 2021. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Martinez resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. **Defendant:** David Brown previously resided in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts but intends to move to New Hampshire for a job opportunity.  

---

### **JURISDICTION**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) c. 208, § 28, which permits the Probate and Family Court to modify custody orders based on a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the minor child.  

4. The minor child, Sofia Brown (aged 8), resides primarily with the Plaintiff in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and has resided in this state for substantially her entire life.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Pursuant to the Court’s order entered on March 15, 2021, the parties share custody of their minor child as follows: Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, has primary physical custody, and Defendant, David Brown, has court-ordered parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  

6. At the time of the existing custody arrangement, both parents resided in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area, and the child attended a local Cambridge public school. The arrangement was structured with the assumption that the parents lived close enough to make shared custody practicable.  

7. The Defendant now seeks to relocate to New Hampshire, which is approximately 90 minutes from the Plaintiff’s home and the child’s school.  

8. The Defendant has proposed maintaining the current schedule despite the significant geographical distance created by his relocation.  

9. The Plaintiff asserts that the relocation would impose an unreasonable burden on the minor child, who would be required to endure long commutes, particularly for the midweek overnights, which would disrupt her access to her school, extracurricular activities, and sufficient rest during school nights.  

10. The minor child, Sofia Brown, has already expressed apprehension and anxiety about the extended travel and its impact on her daily routine, school performance, and personal well-being.  

11. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant's relocation constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not anticipated at the time the original custody order was issued.  

12. Maintaining the current schedule is no longer feasible or in the minor child's best interests.  

13. The Plaintiff seeks to modify the current custody order to reflect a parenting schedule that better aligns with the minor child’s needs and takes into account the logistical realities created by the Defendant’s relocation. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests the elimination of midweek overnights and adjustments to the weekend schedule, to minimize stress to the child and ensure the child’s stability and well-being.

### **LEGAL ARGUMENT AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**  

14. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, the standard for custody modification rests on the demonstration of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that modification serves the best interests of the child.  

15. The Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances. See *R.H. v. B.F.*, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 337 (2012) (finding that physical relocation of a parent can constitute a material change in circumstances requiring modification of parenting orders).  

16. Courts in Massachusetts consistently prioritize the best interests of the child, including ensuring continuity, stability, and access to school, routine, and relationships. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

17. Extended travel for a minor child is disruptive to her education and well-being. *T.M. v. D.R.*, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 775 (2018).  

18. The existing orders were predicated on the geography and proximity of the parents, which has now changed in a way that negatively impacts the child. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) (noting that relocation cases must consider the disruptive effects on the child).  

19. A midweek overnight for a school-aged child who attends school in one state while being required to stay overnight in another unduly burdens the child based on logistical considerations and travel time. *El Chaar v. Clark*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 1109 (2015) (Rule 1:28 decision critiquing proposed parenting time that needlessly disrupts school schedules).  

20. This Court has the discretion to amend parenting schedules in light of changes in work, location, or other life circumstances. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  

21. The Plaintiff’s proposed schedule would allow the Defendant to maintain meaningful parenting time with the minor child while protecting the minor child’s physical, emotional, and developmental well-being. See *G.A.G. v. J.M.E.A.*, 2013 Mass. App. Unpub. LEXIS 613.  

22. The Massachusetts Child Custody statute, M.G.L. c. 208, § 31, and applicable case law require the Court to focus on the child’s best interests above the preferences or convenience of either parent. *Gilmore v. Gilmore*, 369 Mass. 598 (1976).

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances.  
2. Modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on March 15, 2021, to reflect a revised parenting schedule consistent with the minor child’s best interests.  
3. Eliminate the midweek overnight parenting time.  
4. Adjust the weekend schedule, as necessary, to minimize travel for the minor child and ensure her continued participation in school, activities, and other commitments.  
5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems necessary and just.  

Respectfully submitted,
