Thus, the case is accurately cited for the stated proposition, even though the excerpt provided is not the core holding text.",

Without any discussion of those facts or that specific foreseeability analysis, this case does not support the claimed proposition.",

The jury returned a substantial verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed, contending that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict."

The court reiterates that in Massachusetts violation of a statute, including the criminal alcohol statutes invoked, \"does not by itself establish a breach of duty\" and does not create a cause of action where no common-law duty exists. It does not discuss G.L. c. 93A at all, and instead affirms that liability must be grounded in common-law negligence, not negligence per se based on statutory violations.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Violations of these statutes invoke criminal penalties, but the statutes do not expressly or implicitly grant an independent ground for civil liability... 'Any liability on the defendant's part in such a situation must be grounded in the common law of negligence... It has long been the rule in this Commonwealth that violation of a statute does not by itself establish a breach of duty, for it does not constitute negligence per se.'... Since no common law duty exists here, it follows that the statutes relied on by the plaintiff do not of themselves create a cause of action in tort.\""
