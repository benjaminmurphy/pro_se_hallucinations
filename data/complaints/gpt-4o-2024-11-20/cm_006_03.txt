   Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Mark Johnson,**  
   Defendant.  
**_________________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**Introduction**  
Jessica Thompson (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint for Modification, alleges as follows:  

**Parties**  
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides at [Insert Address] in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the mother of Emily Johnson, aged 10, and Lucas Johnson, aged 8 (collectively, the “children”).  
2. Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides at [Insert Address] in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Defendant is the father of the children.  

**Jurisdiction**  
3. This is a Complaint for Modification of an existing order concerning the custody and parenting plan for the minor children. Jurisdiction is proper under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, as the children currently reside in Massachusetts, and this court entered the original custody order that Plaintiff seeks to modify.  

**Procedural History**  
4. On or about March 15, 2021, this court entered a judgment granting primary physical custody of the children to Plaintiff. Defendant was awarded parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.  

**Factual Allegations**  

**Material Change in Circumstances**  
5. Since the entry of the March 15, 2021 custody order, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances that adversely affects the safety and well-being of the children during Defendant’s parenting time.  

6. Defendant has since moved in with an individual (hereafter referred to as “the cohabitant”) who has a criminal history, including a conviction for assault and battery under G.L. c. 265, § 13A, and a prior restraining order issued pursuant to G.L. c. 209A due to allegations of domestic violence.  

7. On multiple occasions, Plaintiff’s children, Emily and Lucas, have expressed fear and discomfort when in the presence of the cohabitant. The children have relayed to Plaintiff incidents of aggressive yelling, door slamming, and at least one instance where the cohabitant grabbed Lucas’s arm with sufficient force to leave a visible mark.  

8. Law enforcement was called to Defendant’s residence by a neighbor during a loud argument, which occurred while the children were present.  

**Best Interests of the Child**  
9. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody order may be modified upon a showing that such modification is in the best interests of the children and based on a material change in circumstances.  

10. The presence of the cohabitant during Defendant’s parenting time creates an unsafe and harmful environment for the children, which justifies modification of the existing custody order to better protect the children’s physical and emotional well-being.  

11. Protection of the children is the paramount concern of the Court under Massachusetts law. Custody determinations focus on the children’s safety and developmental needs. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

12. The court may impose appropriate limitations on parenting time when there is evidence, as here, that the current arrangement is harmful to children. See Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998); Zatsky v. Zatsky, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 7 (1994).  

13. The behavior and criminal history of the cohabitant align with factors courts recognize as adverse to a child’s best interests, particularly where the safety and stability of the children are called into question. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

**Relief Requested**  

**Proposed Modification**  
14. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order as follows:  
   a. The Court prohibit the cohabitant from being present during Defendant’s parenting time.  
   b. Alternatively, the Court order that Defendant’s parenting time be supervised by an appropriate third party to ensure the physical and emotional safety of Emily and Lucas.  

15. The requested modifications are narrowly tailored to achieve the best interests of the children, consistent with Massachusetts law and case law, including Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), which emphasizes the Court’s obligation to safeguard children’s welfare in parenting arrangements.  

**Request for Attorney’s Fees**  
16. Plaintiff has been forced to represent herself in seeking this modification and respectfully requests that the Court consider awarding her attorneys’ fees and costs should representation become necessary. See G.L. c. 208, § 38; C.O. v. M.M., 442 Mass. 648 (2004).  

**Prayer for Relief**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the custody order dated March 15, 2021, as outlined above;  
2. Enter any additional orders necessary to protect the best interests of the children;  
3. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs if professional counsel becomes required;  
4. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
